That gave me about an 80\" display with \"good enough when the lights are off at night\" quality for big screen movie watching.\n\n\nMy new apartment has a four foot longer bedroom and my cheapie projector doesn't have zoom, so a shelf over my bed would make the screen bigger than my wall. Plus the opposite wall has a window on it, so that reduces how much can be used for a projector screen. I can't ceiling-mount the projector either because the entire \"prime real estate\" for mounting it is blocked by a ceiling fan.\n\n\nThree options: 1: Replace the projector with a short-throw projector. Problem: Have yet to find the quality/brightness at my preferred price point. 2: Replace the projector with a long-throw, zoom, or home theater projector. Difficulty: I want to stick to LED lighting and not hot/expensive-to-replace DLP projector lamps - especially since those hot bulbs make a lot of fan noise. 3: Install a regular LCD big-screen TV in the bedroom. My living room TV is only 40 inches, but 55+ inch 1080p TVs are getting competitive especially since I won't be going to 4k any time soon because I don't buy any 4k content. Watching old X-Files episodes on Netflix does not need a 4k TV, but I want something BIG for when I experience new movies for the first time at home. Difficulty: Do I really want a massive TV dominating part of my bedroom wall? The cool part about the projector was that it did not LOOK like it took over the room.\n\n$500-$750 ideal budget. I'd need a screen, too, since the only screen I own is an \"outdoor\" screen over 100 inches - too big with the frame - and the walls are too far off \"white.\"  I already own the sound bar, Apple TV, Steam machine and cables I'd need including ceiling mounting hardware.", "aSentId": 37264, "answer": "I'd go with the TV, and here's why:\n\n1) you're not going to find a solution that also works with your lighting conditions\n\n2) I have one of these projectors - they are big, loud, and hot (even with the fan running). Not the best thing to put above your bed (IMO). You'll be fighting the whir of the fan over the audio every time you turn it on.\n\n3) Best option. No noise from a fan. No need to purchase a screen.

You feel warm when slightly buzzed because alcohol relaxes your veins and allows more blood to the extremities. Without alcohol, your body constricts the veins in your extremities to prevent heat loss and hypothermia. With appropriate clothing the alcohol won't be a detriment but is also completely unnecessary (with appropriate clothing you'll quickly warm up once you start walking).

They could have made the battery 2mm deeper, making it go from 5mm deep to 7mm -- which is a good percentage increase -- then reshaped the internal back cover so it only added 1mm to the phones actual physical depth. \n\nFurthermore they could have rejigged the whole back of the phones internald, putting speakers lower, camera and buttons higher and giving themselves more space to give it a much bigger battery. \n\nYes I realise I'm talking like it is easy, I'm not saying that it is. I'm saying they could have made it a few mm deeper which could give a big % bump in battery life.\n\nThis phone is less than 10mm deep, it can easily stand to be a bit deeper.\n\nAlso, phone manufacturers could offer numerous battery options as standard. You want a an aesthetically pleasing thin phone then get the thinnest battery, you want it to last a lot longer then get the biggest etc. Hell, LG offered 2 batteries and desktop charger in some countries with the G3...just by offering that then that surely should tell them that something needs to be addressed.\n\nThere are many things that can be done but aren't because it messes with the style of the phone. I'm holding my phone now, my fingers and thumb are hanging well over the sides by a minimum of 9mm ( I measured from the thumb hanging over to the screen ) this tells me it could easily stand out another 5mm and I would not notice it to much. That extra size would give me a fantastic battery life. \n\nIf that extra 5mm truly breaks your trouser pockets then your trousers are probably to tight in the first place. Going from 9mm to 14mm is not a huge step when you look at it realistically, but can you? \n\nI'm not asking for a battery that lasts weeks, just one that will easily last a day in true day to day usage. Not a measly few hours, that's poor...no, that's downright shit.\n\nI thought I did my homework with this phone, read the reviews and now realise I was lied to spectacularly. Good news,for me, is I'm not ever that far from a charger. The phone is great, the battery isn't.\n\nAgain, I'm not asking for a nuclear powered phone, just one where common sense designed the battery size, not aesthetics.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qgzt", "qSentId": 40209, "question": "I'm dumbfounded that it seems some people are liking the shitty batteries that we get.\n\nBetter battery life not only means longer phone usage but also more freedom from chargers, less electricity usage, the actual battery not needing to be replaced so quickly, and I'm sure there are more lots more benefits.
