He knows his shortcomings,  and has a outstanding laissez-faire attitude about direction and it's why he had a hard time working on major studio movies. \n\nHe's become very busy and very comfortable being a nerd icon. His movie productions are almost second to his self promotion of his many businesses at this point. No matter the hate, many can agree that Smith has made himself an empire that may not be as money making as Spielberg or even his pal Ben Affleck, but Smith has had continuous success  and I'm a bit envious that he made a life on the filler conversations most of have day to day with our buddies.

A totally new RS game would probably be easier to make than converting the weird code of those games to the 3DS.

A big part of the EU was the fact you could focus on entirely different characters.  I don't know how well the *general public* feels about that, though.

The plan is screwed up by the Jedi (and Palpatine) but by then it is too late for them to back out, so they just keep getting into more trouble.**\n\nAs I understand it, the Trade Federation has a monopoly on most of the major interstellar trading in the Republic. They're unhappy with a tax increase, so take \"industrial action\" by picketing Naboo (a world that is lightly-defended, peaceful, not too important, out of the way, but is highly reliant on imports/exports).\n\nKind of like going on strike, they're not letting any of their trade vessels (or other ships) onto or off the planet. Until the Jedi arrive there's no evidence that they have actually fired on them.\n\nTheir hope is that the Naboo will go running to the Senate and ask that the taxes be lowered, or generally something be done to fix this. Which they do. The Senate, however, can't agree - presumably the Government doesn't want to look weak and cave into industrial pressure over taxes.\n\nThe Trade Federation thus has to raise the stakes; by occupying/controlling the planet, not just blockading it. But this is obviously illegal and they know it (\"Is that legal?\" \"I will make it legal.\"). Their initial plan probably involved getting her to agree to their occupation in advance (i.e. \"Let us land and take over and we might start letting some ships through the blockade - and hopefully the greater attention will force the Senate to fix the problem.\") but the Jedi get in the way and they're forced to land troops without the treaty.\n\nWhich causes a huge problem for them. Their solution is to try to get Amidala to retroactively authorise their occupation - but she escapes (the Jedi getting in the way). Now they're kind of screwed - their last hope is to challenge her claims in the Senate; when she accuses the Federation of invading Naboo, they object on the grounds that she has no evidence (all communication with Naboo is jammed) - and they get a few friendly senators to go along with it. Combine this with the bureaucracy and that should give them a bit of time.\n\nBut really they know they're screwed - but they have to keep going forwards (trusting in their secret advisor) as the alternative is probably a long prison sentence and maybe anti-trust investigations and the revocation of their trade franchise.\n\n----\n\nOf course... we know that the whole thing is being masterminded by Palpatine who wants to show the galaxy how weak the Republic is (to make way for his New Order), show the need for a Grand Army of the Republic (which he needs to enforce the New Order and kill the Jedi), and put himself in a position of power.\n\nThe first part is obvious; the rest of the galaxy sees a bunch of \"squabbling delegates\" endlessly debating things in the Senate while real people are suffering on Naboo - the democracy and bureaucracy is getting in the way, something must be done. This part kind of works.\n\nThe third part is also pretty obvious; Naboo is in his constituency, making him the centre of attention. The brave Senator, standing up to the evil Trade Federation, trying to save his people. And this part works perfectly - Valorum is voted out of office, and Palpatine elected in his place (with the \"strong sympathy vote\").\n\nThe middle part is the one that fails. Pre-Episode II the Republic has no military. It relies on local/regional security to enforce local law, a few private armies (such as the Federations) to keep pirates or whoever at bay, and the Jedi to sort stuff out if it ever gets out of hand (how could you even consider going up against someone who can turn your mind against you and see what you are going to do before you do it?). But if the occupation was successful one imagines Palpatine would start raising the suggestion that the Republic needed an army as it was otherwise powerless against the Federation.\n\nAll this goes horribly wrong when Valorum gets fed up with the endless debates in the Senate and tries to sort stuff out by getting the Jedi involved. That has the potential to end the crisis far too quickly (Palpatine knows that the \"Federation types are cowards - the negotiations will be short\"). He has to take action; convincing the Federation to kill the Jedi is the first step (and is kind of a 'point of no return' for them) - and the invasion was going to happen anyway, but this becomes as good an opportunity as any other time, and may help reduce the chance of people asking awkward questions about some missing Jedi.\n\nUltimately his plan is successful; he is appointed Chancellor, the Republic is shown to be severely weak - but due to the actions of Amidala, the Jedi and Anakin the crisis is still resolved far too quickly. He doesn't have a chance to bring up the creation of a military - and it takes him another decade to manage this.\n\nImho one of the major problems the prequels face is that there's the potential for a lot of fairly complicated/subtle plotting going on - but rather than devote time to it, the films skip over it so there's more room for explosions, podraces and gungans. Hence the lack of detail on what the Separatists want in Ep II, cutting the scenes about establishing the Rebellion in Ep III, and not going into any real detail about the politics/constitution of the Republic.\n\n*I may have thought about this quite a lot.*", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3s", "qSentId": 1633, "question": "It's even funnier that the trade federation:\n\n1. *forces* Amidala sign a treaty - making the concept of a treaty worthless\n2. to grant them *permission* - wait for it... \n3. to occupy Naboo even though they invaded them anyway...???\n\nBut hey.... ten year olds.", "aSentId": 1679, "answer": "This comment made me realize the movie was so bad I didn't even get any of that, because I just didn't care.

A popular soap opera star.\n\nI have to admit that I was actually kind of proud of the fact that everybody left him to his own devices without asking for autographs or fawning over him like people probably do in a lot of places that he goes.\n\nSo I was a little worried when the next person to walk into the bar was the local nutcase. He's not all there in the head. Shouts everything he says in a gruff voice and talks fifty percent nonsense, fifty percent insults. \n\nHe talks to anyone and everyone and can be very hard to get away from.\n\nSo nutcase walks in, strolls right over to soap opera guy, and shouts, *\"PINT OF FUCKIN' GUINNESS!\"*, to the bar maid.\n\nHe then turns to look at soap opera guy, looks up at the TV over his head, then looks back down at soap opera guy and shouts, *\"DID YOU FALL OUT OF THE FUCKIN' TELEVISION?\"*", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3s", "qSentId": 4261, "question": "I once was in a fancy-ish restaurant (not because I often go to fancy restaurants, but because I had a coupon) and was just about finished my meal when who should walk in? Pierce Brosnan himself. \n\nNaturally my holy-shit-its-james-bond-what-do-i-do-what-do-i-do instinct started kicking in, but I kept my cool and went back to eating.\n\nNow this restaurant was kind of small but was pretty packed. So when the hostess met Mr. Brosnan and began to show him to his table she started walking my way and offered him the table directly next to mine. \n\nMy adrenaline levels skyrocketed. My city is pretty small and we don't often see many celebrities around. Mr. Brosnan was the most famous person I had ever seen up close. So, yeah, I was freaking out a bit. Bit I digress.\n\nMr. Brosnan was not as pumped as me \u2013 he gave a subtle, but audible \"ugh\" sound after half glancing at me and then the table. But he sat down and ordered something.\n\nI decided that I'd play it cool and essentially didn't acknowledge him. Celebrities get so much unwanted attention and I didn't want to be just another fan ogling him trying to get a selfie. And there was a couple a few tables away whispering things like \"look honey, look who it is...!\" and if I could hear them then he could too. So I just ate the rest of my meal.\n\nNow I eventually let the 12 year old James Bond fan inside get the best of me and thought, \"This never happens you *have* to say *something*\". So I made sure to pay and everything before I took the leap just in case things went sour.\n\nI turned and said, \"Excuse me Mr. Brosnan, I don't mean to interrupt your dinner, but I'm curious, what brings you to $city?\"\n\nHe simply stopped, turned and said in an very annoyed voice, \"You *are* interrupting my dinner\".\n\nWhoa. Red alert. Was not expecting such quick rejection. I somehow got out an \"Oh..okay\" or something before he realized that he had been sort of curt and offered, still annoyed, \"Work...work brings me to $city\". \n\nI said thanks and then got out of there ASAP.\n\nI realize that there must be so many people that act as if they know celebrities personally and so many more crazies that try to get close to them and get into their lives. He could have just had a bad day too, so I don't blame him for wanting to eat his dinner in peace.\n\nI will, however, keep my mouth shut next time.\n\nTL;DR: Sat next to James Bond at a restaurant, tried to ask a polite question and got instantly shot down.
