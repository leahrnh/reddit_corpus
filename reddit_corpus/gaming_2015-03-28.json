But when it comes down to music, characters, and story it's all quickly forgettable. Even Twilight Princess had memorable music and characters. I sure remember those creepy clowns and that ... baby?

Dungeon designs are somewhat lacking in length but most of that is compensated in the puzzles you solve in the world now which I'm not fond of.

You posted a struggle so I stated what I thought. You either take it or not and I assume that you obviously won't since you don't agree with it.\n\nI just think that out of all the 3D Zelda games this one is the weakest in many ways. I praise the difficulty which is something I haven't had in any Zelda game since Ocarina and that's because I was like 10 when I played it so it doesn't really count. But when it comes down to music, characters, and story it's all quickly forgettable. Even Twilight Princess had memorable music and characters. I sure remember those creepy clowns and that ... baby? Midget child? Wind Waker had some of the best music in a Zelda game and the world was just well done.\n\nThe only theme I find enjoyable is the flight theme. Boss designs are mostly terrible, though some are a blast to fight. Sword play is a ton of fun! Dungeon designs are somewhat lacking in length but most of that is compensated in the puzzles you solve in the world now which I'm not fond of. I prefer exploration over puzzle solving in my over-world.  \n\nIs it worth a purchase? Maybe if you're a Zelda fan boy.
