If you do end up reading Bela\u00f1o don't start with The Savage Detectives or 2666, despite being considered his greatest achievements they are long and difficult to swallow, and he wrote plenty of excellent shorter novels with which you could start with to get a feel for his style and his universe of characters that persists throughout many of his books.

From the books, the ring \"shifts\" the bearer to the \"Wraith\" world/dimension. From the Silly Marilly, the \"Wraith\" dimension is the \"in-between\" from Middle-Earth to the Blessed Lands: many travel *through* it, but to be stuck there is to be a torturous existence.  The Ring holds a \"large part\" of Sauron's power(s), one of these is his ability to exist in Middle-Earth, the \"in-between,\" and the Blessed Lands (though he doesn't dare to attempt a return there in his limited - comparatively - power).\n\nWhen a bearer slips on the ring, the most basic part of Sauron's power in the Ring shifts the bearer to the \"in-between\" ***if*** they don't know how to control it through their Will. This is why the Istari (The Wise, i.e. Gandalf, Radagast, Saruman, et al) don't \"shift.\" First, because they can already do this feat, second because they can exert their Will to control the effect. The Istari can do this already by Gandalf's words in one book (I forget the exact one) where he's telling the tale of being on a hilltop surrounded - along with his companions - and he says he could \"escape at any time, but for the abandonment of my companions\": implying many things, but also the ability to escape unseen. Things like that are sprinkled throughout the books, to be left to discernment and imagination as to the powers the Istari wield.\n\nThe Elves, being of both Middle-Earth and the Blessed Lands, can travel the \"Wraith\" dimension; but, only the powerful can do so at Will. So, the Ring(s) would not have an effect upon them like that unless they allowed it: same as the Istari.\n\nThe Dwarves are wholly creatures of Middle-Earth. They were not created by God (I forget the term, it's been a loooong time since I read the Silly Marilly). They are not able to travel to the Blessed Lands, or see them.  So, they're never able to go into the \"Wraith\" state/world like the others.\n\nMen can ***see*** the Blessed Lands, \"God\" having created *them*, but can never go there as their Fate is a different one determined by \"God.\" That's how the Nine were trapped by Sauron. They gained power being there, but can not go forward to the Blessed Lands, and can only project their Spirits - all that's left of them -  through Will back onto Middle-Earth.\n\n\nTL;DR\n\nSo, there's nothing particularly \"significant\" about this \"invisibility.\" The invisibility is nothing more than a side effect of the nature of the Ring(s).", "aSentId": 8050, "answer": "The Silly Marilly eh?

He was a man of strength and endurance that few even of the D\u00fanedain of that age could equal, but he had little hope to gain the other shore. Before he had gone far he was forced to turn almost north against the current; and strive as he might he was ever swept down towards the tangles of the Gladden Fields. They were nearer than he had thought, and even as he felt the stream slacken and had almost won across he found himself struggling among great rushes and clinging weeds. There suddenly he knew that the Ring had gone. By chance, or chance well used, it had left his hand and gone where he could never hope to find it again. At first so overwhelming was his sense of loss that he struggled no more, and would have sunk and drowned. But swift as it had come the mood passed. The pain had left him. A great burden had been taken away. His feet found the river bed, and heaving himself up out of the mud he floundered through the reeds to a marshy islet close to the western shore. There he rose up out of the water: only a mortal man, a small creature lost and abandoned in the wilds of Middle-earth. But to the night-eyed Orcs that lurked there on the watch he loomed up, a monstrous shadow of fear, with a piercing eye like a star. They loosed their poisoned arrows at it, and fled.

There was a Satan (Melkor in Middle Earth, and I find his name funny because it paraphrases Melchior - the Fairest, which was one of the names of Satan before he actually became Satan or Morgoth) in Middle Earth, who did not like what God (Eru Iluvatar) was doing. He was the original Dark Lord, who created or rather - incarnated the ideas of dragons, fire demons (Balrog), ice demons  and so forth.  \n\nThen there was two Apocalyptical wars between gods, during which major parts of the Earth(Ea) were destroyed and Melchior/Melkor/Morgoth/Satan was locked out of the Universe. Melkor is the archetypal evil - a major god or archangel, if you will, who had gone rogue - his idea was to actually destroy everything, while Sauron was a minor deity who liked to craft and organized things - he joined Melkor because Melkor gave him more of a leeway to do those things, but I doubt that if Melkor even succeeded Sauron would live.\n\nSauron was powerful, as he was created - the more damage he suffered the less powerful he actually become, but being a deity, especially the one in service to a main god, he could never be \"killed\". What you see in the movie is not a death but merely disincarnation.\n\nNow, the ring contained the most of his power - not because someone did it (or plot device), but because he made the ring himself as a device to subjugate (and organize) the people of the Earth by mind controlling their leaders though the other 20 rings he made - that included transferring his power to incarnate in a physical form to the ring, so when the ring was chopped off he was disincarnated and lost mind control over his armies.\n\nTo explain more of the magic physics in the Middle Earth - only major gods could do major magical action at a distance, because they were there when the Earth was created and by the act of creation, they have also created access points/backdoors/control mechanisms for the \"dead\" parts of the nature as well as for some of the \"living\" parts, notably the animals. Elves, Human and Dwarves could not really be mind controlled or body controlled at a distance if an unwilling mind was present because they had not been created in the act of the original creation of the world.\n\nThus Melkor as well as Aule the Smith both had a major power within the world, but could not really use it for \"physics breaking\" reasons, and also because it would have engendered a cataclysmic change (which by the way it did during the wars against Melkor), and they could not transmit this power, as it was connected with themselves on a personal level as a part of their being, only the way to use those back doors or control mechanisms, not the way to create new control mechanisms or new back-doors.\n\nThis is why none of the major deities can ever be destroyed unless the Earth/Universe is destroyed too , hence the locking-out of Melkor.\n\nThis also explains the \"assholishness\" of Gandalf - he very seldom used any magic at all, and the apparent power of Sauron - Gandalf was relying on \"infrastructure\" - this is why he was reincarnated in a more powerful form, to do his work or else he would have been \"fired\" - that is the use of magic is nothing but a use of advanced form of energy and material manipulation, and the laws of conservation being same everywhere and as it is apparent from the Tolkien lore we can be pretty sure that any magic act had a consequence.  Since Gandalf and all the other wizards were immortal beings, in power equal to Sauron, theoretically they could destroy him with disastrous consequences for the world. \n\nSince Melkor didn't give two shits about the world, as he wanted to destroy it, he taught Sauron a maximal possible array of magic methods, because they were not caring of the collateral damage, but Sauron does not have divine \"infrastructure\" and his \"boss\" is in \"jail\" so his energy resources are great, but slowly diminishing over time, he can only reincarnate if he did everything right and expected to get disincarnated, he does not lose magic/matter manipulation power over time, but as less and less magic is globally allowed on Middle Earth/Earth/Ea (the passing of the Elves to the East, the abandonment of the rings and so forth), he gets gradually more normal-person-like and less godlike in his abilities - less strong, so everything takes more time to do.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh4i", "qSentId": 8891, "question": "Rather then make a separate thread I thought I just asked is here cause I've always want to know: if Sauren was so powerful and had the ring on which made him even more powerful how the heck was he defeated in the first place? \nThe movie showed mere human being Cut his fingers off and from there he just sort of explodes or something.\n\nAnd I get that the human had some sort of magic sword and that he was part of a powerful bloodline or something but I thought Sauren was supposed to be borderline an invincible, so the idea that this sore just chopped his handoff and that once his hand came off he just died seemed pretty stupid\n\nWhat am I missing?", "aSentId": 8894, "answer": "Isildur was of the royal line of N\u00famenor, and Aragorn is descended from him.

Plenty of young women get too drunk at parties without any intention of having sex with anyone, and will take up a friend's offer to sleep it off at that person's house. If the friend is a good person, that's all that will happen. Sometimes, you misjudge whether a person is trustworthy, or you get too drunk in an unsafe place and someone takes advantage of that. That doesn't make it your fault and it doesn't mean you secretly wanted it. It's always the fault of the rapist, not the person who gets raped. \n\nAlso, she conflates sex and rape. Some women do throw themselves at rock stars, and then have sex with them! That's fine. It does feel good to be wanted. There's nothing rapey about women getting turned on by men being turned on. I don't even know what that's doing in a passage where she talks about rape, because those are two completely different things. It makes me very skeptical of her analysis that she can't differentiate between someone getting raped at a party and someone having consensual sex with a rock star.\n\nI think she's also wrong that all sex is dominating and egotistical. Some women like to be sexually dominated. As long as it's consensual, that's cool with me. But you can't generalize that to all women. Some women don't like to be sexually dominated, and they can have hot egalitarian/vanilla sex.

Plenty of young women get too drunk at parties without any intention of having sex with anyone, and will take up a friend's offer to sleep it off at that person's house. If the friend is a good person, that's all that will happen. Sometimes, you misjudge whether a person is trustworthy, or you get too drunk in an unsafe place and someone takes advantage of that. That doesn't make it your fault and it doesn't mean you secretly wanted it. It's always the fault of the rapist, not the person who gets raped. \n\nAlso, she conflates sex and rape. Some women do throw themselves at rock stars, and then have sex with them! That's fine. It does feel good to be wanted. There's nothing rapey about women getting turned on by men being turned on. I don't even know what that's doing in a passage where she talks about rape, because those are two completely different things. It makes me very skeptical of her analysis that she can't differentiate between someone getting raped at a party and someone having consensual sex with a rock star.\n\nI think she's also wrong that all sex is dominating and egotistical. Some women like to be sexually dominated. As long as it's consensual, that's cool with me. But you can't generalize that to all women. Some women don't like to be sexually dominated, and they can have hot egalitarian/vanilla sex.

Rowling's work is what is referred to as a \"close third\" person point of view, meaning that it's actually a first person point of view in that we only get Harry's thoughts feelings and experiences (there are a very few chapters that go outside Harry's realm of experience, for the most part we only know what Harry knows).  This is only my major concern with your statement that the two authors are the same.  Their chosen authorial point of view aside, their prose styles are completely dissimilar.  I would be interested in any concrete evidence you have in this case.", "aSentId": 11369, "answer": "&gt; Some items introduced or foreshadowed in very early books do not come to fruition until very late in the series, showing masterful forethought and pre-planning.\n\nYeah, people go on about the foreshadowing, but I'm unconvinced. To me it always felt like she came up with plot points in earlier books without actually knowing what she was going to with them. The later books are absolutely jam packed with deus ex machina contrivances to get her out of plot dead ends.\n\n&gt; Thematically, the Harry Potter books tackle complex interpersonal themes\n\nThey mention complex interpersonal themes...I disagree that she actually tackles them. She uses intrigue between the characters to create drama, she rarely takes it any further. Take Harry and Cho, she's introduced, they flirt, they kiss, she betrays him, they break up and it's barely mentioned again. I wouldn't call that issue tackled. She titillates the reader with the suggestion of complex themes, she hardly ever explores them.\n\n&gt; I would stand by Harry Potter as an important work of modern mythology before any audience.\n\nNot sure why you think it can't be an important kids book.\n\n&gt; And I'll make the further remark that her writing style is absolutely nothing like Raold Dahl\n\nIt's not the writing style, it's the themes. In the first couple of books in particular, the Dursleys and Harrys homelife is very Dahl-esque. The evil step parents, the cruel and unusual punishment, their grotesqueness, Harry's intelligence and secret powers being used for revenge against their stupidity and spitefulness. These are themes common of virtually every book Dahl wrote.\n\n&gt; I find myself asking if you have read/listened to (listening to an audiobook being an entirely different experience from reading a book yourself) any children's literature except Dahl and Rowling's.\n\nBeing a child of the 80's mostly Fred Hoyle and Nigel Hinton when I was very young. Roald Dahl, Sue Townsend, C. S. Lewis and Jill Murphy when I started school. I got into Michael Crichton when I was about 11 for obvious reasons, who I'd argue is kind of like a childrens author. After that I started reading rubbish horror like James Herbert until I found my one true love in Iain Banks when I was about 15.\n\nIncidentally, when I say read/listened it's because I read the first 3 and a half books and decided I didn't want to waste more time on them so I listened to the rest. I tend to listen to stuff I don't enjoy enough to make time to sit down and read. I did the same with Game of Thrones, I read the first book and decided I wanted to know what happens but not enough to sit through one more character saying \"He has the right of it\"", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh4i", "qSentId": 11373, "question": "I went to the theatre to see the first three movies.. i also fell asleep during every one.

I made a concerted effort the summer before I went to college to read the bible cover to cover in English in one shot (took me about 2 weeks). My faith was obliterated. I threw myself into philosophy to try and patch it up, but the teleological and ontological arguments that had previously been my lifeline unraveled in the light of Chomsky and post-structuralists and their interpretations of the subjectivity of language. Language games, that\u2019s all those arguments were anymore. \n\nAt the same time I began studying cultural anthropology and nursing. The combination of social theory (Foucault and Derrida, especially) with the realities of biochemical determinism (oh my god DNA rules my life) turned me from sad ex-Christian to depressed agnostic. Even my rebound attempts at romantic philosophy and existentialism had been obliterated by taking the postmodern turn. I had been crushed. I ended up taking some time off from school for a variety of reasons to work as an EMT and do some self-study, further working out my philosophical inquiry. I came back, and got a sweet gig in our school\u2019s archaeology collection. While working there, an archaeology prof who was an expert in the Levant became a sort of mentor to me, and I ended up taking an Old Testament archaeology class with him. This radically changed my view of the Old Testament. I saw the Israelites as the complex group they were, and the Bible as a complex product of the times. Allusions to contemporary works like the Enuma Elish and Sumerian poetry that had previously wooshed over my head started to make sense. The Bible is not random; it is meticulously and artfully constructed. One just has to see it anthropologically to understand that. I was still an atheist, though. Well, maybe an agnostic. \n\nSince then I\u2019ve done more reading, and more anthropology. I'm about to start my master's in Nursing and hopefully get signed with the Navy, but I still like to explore social theory and the implications of language and culture in my spare time. Like most anthro students, I\u2019m in love with ritual, which is what brought me to an Anglican church in the first place. I just started to go so that I could use a familiar set of rituals to calm my mind and meditate, but then I started to read the Bible again. I guess you could say I\u2019m more of a warm Deist now than a full blown Christian (?), but that is subject to change. Christians fuck a lot of things up and I\u2019m reluctant to take the label that goes with it, but the way truth is expressed through different sets of rituals the world over is intoxicating to me. What that truth actually is I\u2019m still working out. Ok. This comment is getting too long, I\u2019m just meandering now. Plus I\u2019m a tad hungover. Hopefully that helped.
