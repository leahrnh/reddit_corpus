A sense of meaning? WTF", "aSentId": 60953, "answer": "So, it's impossible to believe that people at the time may have found meaning in what they were doing? That all those French, American, British and Commonwealth soldiers could have looked on the events taking place around them without the hindsight-based cynicism with which we look upon them today?\n\nWas it impossible for some to take pride in their unit? To want to 'see this thing through' with or for their 'mates'? That they might've taken pride in representing their country (the operations of the ANZACs and the Canadians were the largest enterprises that people of their country had undertaken, en masse, and with INTERNATIONAL significance)? Was it wrong for the French 'Poilus' to fight on, to liberate occupied France and vanquish the German armies that threatened their country?\n\n How about the 'Tommies'; sure, most of them were there because they'd been asked, but as of 1916 most soldiers in the BEF were still VOLUNTEERS, the Derby Plan having disappointed and conscription having only just been implemented. Writings from the time show the misery of the trenches, and of the terrors of war; this shows that, like most human beings (i'd hope!), these were ordinary men who enjoyed peace, and hated conflict. But if 'seeing this thing through', fighting for your friends, fighting so that this war could be won, peace restored, and a brighter future hopefully ensured, meant that the terrible sacrifices of the Somme, Arras and Ypres had to be made? Then those were sacrifices that most were willing to make, though the strain of combat pushed many to their limits, esp. in the bloody fighting in 1917.\n\nI think for most of the soldiers, Siegfried Sassoon's poem 'The Redeemer' gives a rough idea of why they fought:\n\nNo thorny crown, only a woolen cap/ He wore-an English soldier, white and strong/ who loved his time like any simple chap/ Good days of work and sport and homely song;/ Now he has learned that nights are very long,/ and dawn a watching of the windowed sky./ But to the end, unjudging, he'll endure/ Horror and pain, not uncontent to die/ That Lancaster on Lune may stand secure.\n\nOr try C. E. Montague, another man who experienced and wrote about the horrors of the first world war:\n\nBut the war had to be won: that was flat. It was like putting out houses on fire, or not letting children be killed; it did not even need to be proved; that we had got to win was now the one quite certain thing left in a world of shaken certainties.\n\nI think that historical events like the First World War are better approached by trying to understand the actions, decisions, and lives of the people involved, rather than looking down on it through the distorted lens of the decades that followed. Very, VERY FEW soldiers 'enjoyed' the First World War, again, they were normal human beings like you and me, just in a different time and context. But most did take pride in what they achieved, and felt that they had done their job.

In lines 130-262 Diomedes (Greek) who has been given clairvoyance by Hera, comes across a soldier in the Trojan line named Glaucus. Before engaging in battle Diomedes demands to know who Glaucus is^1 and Glaucus responds:\n\n*And the son of Hippolochus answered, son of Tydeus, why ask me of my lineage? Men come and go as leaves year by year upon the trees. Those of autumn the wind sheds upon the ground, but when spring returns the forest buds forth with fresh vines. Even so is it with the generations of mankind, the new spring up as the old are passing away. If, then, you would learn my descent, it is one that is well known to many. There is a city in the heart of Argos, pasture land of horses, called Ephyra, where Sisyphus lived, who was the craftiest of all mankind. He was the son of Aeolus, and had a son named Glaucus, who was father to Bellerophon, whom heaven endowed with the most surpassing comeliness and beauty. But Proetus devised his ruin, and being stronger than he, drove him from the land of the Argives, over which Jove had made him ruler. For Antea, wife of Proetus, lusted after him, and would have had him lie with her in secret; but Bellerophon was an honourable man and would not, so she told lies about him to Proteus.

The king was angered, but shrank from killing Bellerophon, so he sent him to Lycia with lying letters of introduction, written on a folded tablet, and containing much ill against the bearer.

Then the king knew that he must be the valiant offspring of a god, so he kept him in Lycia, gave him his daughter in marriage, and made him of equal honour in the kingdom with himself; and the Lycians gave him a piece of land, the best in all the country, fair with vineyards and tilled fields, to have and to hold.*\n\n*\"The king's daughter bore Bellerophon three children, Isander, Hippolochus, and Laodameia.

Sons formed a second line of guest-friendships with other aristocratic families, these networks were a crucial role to government and Greek society. You can even notice this in Homer's *The Iliad* in book six Hector Returns to Troy. In lines 130-262 Diomedes (Greek) who has been given clairvoyance by Hera, comes across a soldier in the Trojan line named Glaucus.

There is a city in the heart of Argos, pasture land of horses, called Ephyra, where Sisyphus lived, who was the craftiest of all mankind. He was the son of Aeolus, and had a son named Glaucus, who was father to Bellerophon, whom heaven endowed with the most surpassing comeliness and beauty. But Proetus devised his ruin, and being stronger than he, drove him from the land of the Argives, over which Jove had made him ruler. For Antea, wife of Proetus, lusted after him, and would have had him lie with her in secret; but Bellerophon was an honourable man and would not, so she told lies about him to Proteus. 'Proetus,' said she, 'kill Bellerophon or die, for he would have had converse with me against my will.' The king was angered, but shrank from killing Bellerophon, so he sent him to Lycia with lying letters of introduction, written on a folded tablet, and containing much ill against the bearer.

You must examine that all Greek Societies embraced Pederasty, it was even part of The Great Spartan Rhetra. It was a building block of education in the eyes of the ancient Greeks. \n\n**I'm going to include some notes I have from my Greek History Symposium on Pederasty here:**\n\n*The Ancient Greek tradition of an older man courting a younger man in a sometimes homoerotic and symbiotic social relationship. The older man would be expected to have wisdom and experience which he would pass onto the younger boy, while the younger boy would act as a muse to the older man. These relationships held a very important place in society, as families were bonded not only by marrying off daughters and exchanging dowries but developing these relationships between their sons and older men of powerful families creating a sense of political unison. The relationships were viewed as a pupil-student bond and the erotic element of the relationship was viewed as a building block to education.* \n\n*There was a sexual component to this, it was generally conceived to be a mutual exchange and a relationship would be cultivated. There was traditionally a ritual to this and it proceeded in the following fashion: the older man would approach the father of the boy he wanted to connect with. He would then negotiate with the father, and with his approval would be allowed to pursue the younger boy with gifts, promises, and letters of affection in a traditional courting style. There are rules to this however, even if the older man is to win the favors of the boy he cannot consummate the relationship. For the younger boy, he only receives gifts from men that are predetermined between his father and the older man in question. The younger boy is also not to yield to the sexual advances of the older man that easily, playing hard to get is an intricate part of the homoerotic relationship. In addition, once they have cultivated a relationship, the older man has to watch out for the younger boy in society. The emotional friendship that has developed as the younger boy grows older gets carried on and maintains itself as a lifetime political alliance. However, there is a sexual component to this and in the eyes of the ancient Greeks there was no social stigma against this.*\n\n*Ancient Greeks lacked the gender binary that is so strong in society today, and entering into a homosexual or homoerotic relationship did not disqualify someone from being married. It was also socially acceptable for someone to be married and be in a homosexual relationship at the same time. These relationships were generally commonplace for a boy between the age of eleven and fifteen, it was a social rule that when the younger boy grew his first beard and shaved it off (first beards were kept as keepsake) that the sexual paradigm of the relationship was over. Generally when a homosexual relationship extended past the shaving of the first beard, there was something else at play. However, in Spartan communities the homosexual aspect of these relationships continued past this point. This was not without reason however. The relationship, while it created a strong political bond between families also created a strong personal bond that was important on the battlefield in this militaristic society. These relationships helped transcend the generational differences in the army.*\n\nYou see stories all over the place, but for some reason when I think of someone whose homosexual engagements were at the forefront of their success - - my mind still links to Ephialtes and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Pericles son of Xanthippus. Perhaps Alcibiades, but he is more known for his dealings with the Spartan Queen and the trouble he stirred up in exile in Persia under Darius's Court.

From the 1940s to well into the 80s, the military vigorously resisted any sort of safety or disarming features on nuclear weapons, claiming that something that could render the device inert could be exploited by an enemy.\n\nIn 1961, nuclear bombs were just armed by throwing a few analog on/off toggle switches in the cockpit. And that's why when a B-52 broke apart during a refueling accident and dropped its two hydrogen bombs over Goldsboro, NC, the *one and only thing* that prevented one of the bombs from detonating was that ONE toggle switch did not get thrown during the breakup. The detonate signal was actually sent, but the final circuit was not armed. \n\nBut eventually, the government started leaning on the military to include at least Permissive Action Links (PALs) on nuclear weapons, essentially arming codes set by a very sophisticated device. Without the right PAL set, there was no way to set the bomb off, no matter what you did to it (welllll...almost. But that's another story).\n\nHowever, even as PALs were installed, the military continued to be defiant, and for about 20 years, the PAL to *arm*--not launch--the *entire* US Minuteman missile fleet was set to 00000000. And of course, that number was known to every single launch officer and technician. \n\nToday, there is a popular belief that there is a \"launch code\" that must be sent to a sub, plane, or silo.

This charming document had one simple response to the confirmed launch of even a single Russian nuke: LUDICROUS retaliation.\n\nAt the time of Jimmy Carter's presidency (the last one I have definite figures for), it called for a retaliation strike of some TEN THOUSAND NUCLEAR WEAPONS to be launched at Russia and other targets, all within a span of a few hours (which, yes, would have triggered a nuclear winter and ended human life on Earth).

But as it was in their interest to have the mines worked, and as they seldom cared to bear the risks of operating them, there were practical limits to their demands. They could not afford to be exorbitant. Their claims to revenue were frequently reduced to meet the increased costs which the miners had to undergo in sinking, draining and ventilating the pits.\n\nAnd regarding workers\n\n&gt;Wherever the digging and the working of ores were sufficiently important to employ several scores of miners and smelters, little mining communities were formed. These communities were separate from those of the local peasants engaged in tillage and pasture farming. They had their own laws and customs. Such special communities multiplied rapidly in number especially in Central Europe during the late twelfth and thirteenth centuries. They were everywhere the rule in the digging and smelting of silver, gold, copper, tin and lead ores. In the making of iron they were rather less common. Elsewhere the digging of coal for the most part, and in many cases the digging and smelting of iron ore, were undertaken more informally by a few local peasants, working either for themselves or for some lord of the soil, frequently on days when they were not engaged in husbandry.\n\nSource:The Cambridge Economic History of Europe Volume 2: Trade and Industry in the Middle Ages,", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh53", "qSentId": 61534, "question": "/u/LiberalDanger if an iron mine was owned by a local Lord of the Manor (Baron) would he have employed his serfs to work the mine as part of their work hours dedicated to him?

The origin of their claims to dispose of mines under private lands subject to their authority (the Bergregal) is obscure. It was certainly not Roman but feudal. Regalian rights to mines, like regalian rights to coin silver money, were not recognised before the tenth or even the eleventh century. The new claims probably had much to do with the remarkable growth in mining, particularly in the mining of silver-bearing ores, needed for coinage. As claims to the regale were frequently limited, especially until after the thirteenth century, to ores containing gold or silver, there is a temptation to assume that one source of the regalian rights may have been the idea, later set forth in favour of these rights in the English 'case of mines', in 1566, that the overlord had a special title as the most excellent person to the most excellent things within his territorial dominions.\n\n&gt;During the twelfth and thirteenth centuries European overlords were claiming with much success the rights to dispose of ores containing gold or silver (then won mainly from seams of argentiferous lead ore), and in some cases of tin and copper ore as well, both in their own lands and in those of their subjects. When the mines were worked, they claimed a share in the produce. This share generally included a settled portion of the ore or metal, frequently a tenth. In addition the overlords usually received coinage duties; they often had the right of pre-emption over the entire output of the best metal \u2014 i.e. a right to buy all of it at a lower price than that which it might have commanded if sold on the open market\n\n&gt;The emperors treated this participation in the administration of mining, along with the claim to a revenue from the mines, as attributes of sovereign authority, distinguished from those rights which went with the tenure of landed estates. According to this doctrine, no lord of the soil could have valuable minerals dug within his lands without the permission of the emperor. In case the emperor had delegated his authority to an overlord, the overlord^s permission was required. After the death of Barbarossa, the political powers of the emperors diminished throughout the Holy Roman Empire and especially in Germany.  As Charles IV made clear in his famous Golden Bull of 1356, the emperors relinquished their regalian rights to mines whenever they relinquished their sovereign authority. Regalian rights went with lordship of territories. This did not prevent a territorial prince, if he chose, from investing certain of his vassals, or even his rear vassals, with his regalian rights. He could do so while he retained the general authority which went with territorial lordship. In this way, he could rid himself of the obligation to oversee mines in many regions. The emperors, the kings of Bohemia, the dukes of Silesia and other princes of the Empire all took advantage of this opportunity to delegate their mining responsibilities. In consequence the number of overlords exercising regalian (or even sovereign) rights in Central Europe was continually growing. \n\n&gt;The unwary are likely to assume that the regalian authority of the territorial princes in the Empire was more extensive than was actually the case. In the fourteenth century few holders of the regale had successfully put forward a claim to base ores in the lands of private owners (Grundherren) within their territorial dominion.In Bohemia the kings generally limited their claims to ores containing substantial quantities of gold or silver. Consequently much mining was carried on during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries outside the regale.\n\n&gt; We are here frequently in the presence of a valid distinction which masks a practical reality. The territorial lord was always a private landlord as well. Within the territorial jurisdiction over which he ruled were estates that belonged to him directly. As it happened, a large part of the ores dug in Central Europe during the thirteenth century were in mountainous country, and so in waste land, in no-man's land. Territorial princes claimed such land as part of their demesne. This gave them adequate authority as private landlords to dispose of many base ores in the same way as they disposed, by virtue of their sovereign rights, of ores containing precious metal.\n", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh53", "qSentId": 61530, "question": "Who owned mines and other non-agrarian operations in the Feudal system?", "aSentId": 61543, "answer": "I found a passage in the Laws of Edward the Confessor (early 12th century English law treatise) that you might find interesting regarding your question.

First, no matter how good you are, no matter how great your academic record, no matter how many connections you make; working as an academic researcher, becoming a professor, or even just teaching high school English is unlikely. Even if you do everything right, the chances are pretty good that you won't be able to find work doing what you are passionate about. If you talk to your advisers, or people in the field, they will tell you stories about how they got where they are, and it will seem simple. What they probably won't tell you are how shitty the job statistics are, and how few people work for years only to end up crushed by debt in an impossible job market.\n\nSecond, money doesn't buy happiness, but it does make it much more possible. History has amongst the worst prospects for earning potential. Couple that with the fact that you *probably* won't get a job in the field and you *probably* won't like what you do get a job in and it can really really suck.\n\nMaybe you're the exception. Maybe you'll get through college and into a prestigious grad program and then into a tenure track position somewhere. If it's what you decide to pursue, I hope that it all works out for you. However, you will get nothing but confirmation bias from people who have already defied the odds and succeeded in the journey that you want to pursue. That means that they weren't just good, they were profoundly lucky at multiple points and ended up where almost nobody does. You owe it to yourself to consider just how big that risk is, and whether the very likely undesirable outcome is worth the gamble.\n\nI say all of this as someone who pursued a liberal arts education and who intended to pursue my PhD. Not only is the job market bad, it's getting worse. Do a little research on what it's like to be a adjunct professor and how the number of tenure track positions continues to shrink. If you think you can just teach grade-school, look at the numbers for History teachers, which are also bad and poorly funded due to the difficulty of incorporating history into standardized testing.\n\nA degree with a good career path along with hobbies you can be passionate about might be a better option.
