", "aSentId": 58322, "answer": "The first part is correct: the technological advances which make First World War combat tactics look silly and suicidal to us were a few years off and even then, well beyond the industrial capacities of states like Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire.\n\nThe second part of your assertion is a little more problematic, because the tactics were not the closed-rank, lock-step tactics of Napoleon's time. Nor were they, however, the small-unit tactics of the Second World War, characterized by mobile and near-instantaneous field communication and heavy but mobile automatic and explosive firepower. We can see elements of both in the tactics favored by the Great Powers during 1914 and 1915. I can't speak in more detail outside the realm of my specialty - Austria-Hungary - but at least for that state, advances had been made in small-unit infantry tactics. The doctrine involved loose-formation skirmishing lines advancing in short sprints until reaching a firing position some several hundred yards from the enemy's line. At this point, provided that enough of your skirmishers had survived getting to the firing position, your company or battalion would seek to lay enough rifle (and maybe even artillery and machine gun) fire onto the enemy line so as to \"soften it up\" for the final bayonet charge.\n\nThe Austrian system of assault, at least in theory, then, comprised three phases: movement (towards the enemy line), firefight (about 200 yards or so from the enemy line, in prone position) and *Sturm* or \"assault.\" While they had failings which were clear both from looking at the theoretical underpinnings and their application in actual war situations, the tactics employed by the Austrians did have some bright spots. The Austrians, though slow on the uptake vis-a-vis almost every other modern instrument of war, caught onto to the machine gun rather quickly and established a decent school of machine-gunnery at Bruck-an-der-Leitha. The II Battalion of the 1st Viennese Landwehr Infantry Regiment, whose story I have researched personally at the War Archives in Vienna, used the machine gun as an offensive weapon on the very first day of the war, effectively mowing down lines of fleeing Russians. And these weren't the machine guns of 1917, either. These were the massive, 100-pound behemoths which required mules to drag.\n\nThe Austrians' tactical doctrines were inadequate, but not so in lieu of something better. At this point in military history, the defenders simply had the advantage. The tactics the Austrians did come up with could indeed be deadly, but they could also win battles. The Austrians, at least, also displayed a rather honed theoretical view of tactics (for what it's worth, as their tenets could not be applied in reality) and a precocious understanding of what to do with certain weapons, like the machine gun.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh53", "qSentId": 58321, "question": "Yes.

Above all they are poorly articulated, a discontinuous series of images, vivid in themselves but badly arranged like a reel of film that showed here and there large gaps and the unintended reversal of certain scenes.\"*\n\nThese gaps create issues. Where wider, popular myths are particularly strong individuals may be encouraged consciously or subconsciously to fill in the gaps or make additions for the memories they rehearse to align with popular perception; whether to feel accepted or a want to make their narrative heard among the thousands of others.  \n\nI'm kind of dodging the question though, aren't I? Yes, there were likely times when casualties got to a point where the bodies could be used as cover. Was it common? Obviously no. Did soldiers just march lockstep into a hail of machine gun bullets without a care in the world? Jesus Christ no; people were not stupid and they still had a sense of survival instinct. Yes lots of people died but, really, that's true for *any* assault on *any* defensive position from the Siege of Moscow c. 1812 to, like, the 1970's. So really the issue isn't the fact that lots of people died it's the exceptionalist nature we apply to it in the context of WWI but deny to all the other conflicts that had the same issues.\n\nA great work on this is Dan Todman's *The Great War: Myth and Memory*!", "aSentId": 58328, "answer": "Thanks for recommending Dan Todman's work.

Your brain is an amazing computer which can detect and interpret aromas and flavors in the levels of parts per trillion.  Just two drops of 3-isobutyl-2-methoxypyrazine (found in many vegetables, fruits, and wine) in an Olympic size swimming pool will make the entire pool taste like green bell peppers.  The physical detection of chemicals in wine is there, science has yet to refute that - the issue and controversy is how our brain interprets the chemistry.\n\nLet's use an analogy, shall we?  Think of a piano player.  When a piano player puts their fingers down on the keys - a note is played and we hear that note.  Our brain interprets the note and we await the next note.  If a piano player plays this note, that note, and that note - we hear a certain chord.  Our brain identifies that note combination as a C chord.  But if the piano player plays that note, this note, and that other note - our brain recognizes that specific combination of notes as a different chord entirely, let's say an E chord.  \n\nYour brain's interpretation of aroma, taste, and flavor is very similar to this analogy.  When you smell or taste a glass of wine, chemicals are binding to specific receptors in your nose and mouth in a certain way and triggering signals to your brain.  So, chemical A swoops through your nostril and binds to this receptor, that receptor, and those receptors in a specific way or sequence - your brain registers those specific receptors and sequences and says \"Ah!  I've sensed this before - that's chocolate!\"  Chemical B enters your nostril and binds to that receptor, this receptor, and these receptors way over there and your brain says \"Hmm, these are the same receptors that go off when I taste an apple!  It must be a apple or fruit of some kind!\"  Some of the chemicals in wine are not the same chemicals that you ingest when you eat, say, chocolate or apple, but your brain interprets them the same way.  It hears the same set of piano keys being played.  Our physical detection and interpretation of sensory chemistry can explain some of the discrepancies between individuals tasting wine - why this person senses black fruit while the other senses strawberries, etc.  \n\nNow, there is another side of sensory perception which further complicates our understanding.  Personal cognitive bias.  This has a huge influence on your sensory perception of anything, be it wine, burgers, tea, chocolate, etc.  Many, shall we say, \"anti-wine tasters\", cite the often linked article on a wine tasting panel describing red wine characteristics while tasting a white wine with food coloring.  Thus, the pitchforks come out and wine tasting is clearly a sham.  But let's think about it for a moment.  As scientists, we have to ask ourselves what the study was trying to achieve in the first place.  Were the authors trying to disprove wine tasting?  Not in the slightest.  They were attempting to show that the visual has as much of an influence on our sensory perception as the physical does - smelling, tasting, touching.  We see something and we judge it and *expect* certain qualities based off of the visual.  If Burger King all of a sudden started boosting the visuals of their burgers, we would see a massive increase in customer satisfaction with the *flavors*, even though the ingredients are the same.  Consumers enjoy their food more when it looks a certain way.  The white-to-red study absolutely succeeded in showing that our human brain is influenced by *visuals* - but that's where the conclusions should end.  No where in the published paper do the authors challenge wine tasting, they merely point out that the color of a wine influences the way our brain interprets the chemistry.  If the panelists were blindfolded while tasting the white-to-red wine, the color would not have been an issue and they would have likely described quote-unquote normal white wine descriptors.\n\nI have to go to work but I hope this post shows that some of your notions of wine tasting might not cover the entire picture.  When we're dealing with the human brain, the explanation has to be as complex and sophisticated as the organ itself.  Wine tasting is certainly open to interpretation and bull shit, but there are underlying principles which influence the way we smell, taste, and ultimately judge the food and beverages placed before us.\n\nNo Tl;DR - Do try to read the whole post, I think you might learn something and go to bed tonight smarter and more informed than when you woke up.\n\nMore on this later.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh53", "qSentId": 58635, "question": "This is a topic that I would like to discuss at great length on Reddit at some point in the near future.  \n\nSensory perception is a fascinating field of study in that it deals not only with the physical chemistry, but also neurology and how our brains interpret single and complex interactions of molecules in solution.

Your brain is an amazing computer which can detect and interpret aromas and flavors in the levels of parts per trillion.  Just two drops of 3-isobutyl-2-methoxypyrazine (found in many vegetables, fruits, and wine) in an Olympic size swimming pool will make the entire pool taste like green bell peppers.  The physical detection of chemicals in wine is there, science has yet to refute that - the issue and controversy is how our brain interprets the chemistry.\n\nLet's use an analogy, shall we?  Think of a piano player.  When a piano player puts their fingers down on the keys - a note is played and we hear that note.  Our brain interprets the note and we await the next note.  If a piano player plays this note, that note, and that note - we hear a certain chord.  Our brain identifies that note combination as a C chord.  But if the piano player plays that note, this note, and that other note - our brain recognizes that specific combination of notes as a different chord entirely, let's say an E chord.  \n\nYour brain's interpretation of aroma, taste, and flavor is very similar to this analogy.  When you smell or taste a glass of wine, chemicals are binding to specific receptors in your nose and mouth in a certain way and triggering signals to your brain.  So, chemical A swoops through your nostril and binds to this receptor, that receptor, and those receptors in a specific way or sequence - your brain registers those specific receptors and sequences and says \"Ah!  I've sensed this before - that's chocolate!\"  Chemical B enters your nostril and binds to that receptor, this receptor, and these receptors way over there and your brain says \"Hmm, these are the same receptors that go off when I taste an apple!  It must be a apple or fruit of some kind!\"  Some of the chemicals in wine are not the same chemicals that you ingest when you eat, say, chocolate or apple, but your brain interprets them the same way.  It hears the same set of piano keys being played.  Our physical detection and interpretation of sensory chemistry can explain some of the discrepancies between individuals tasting wine - why this person senses black fruit while the other senses strawberries, etc.  \n\nNow, there is another side of sensory perception which further complicates our understanding.  Personal cognitive bias.  This has a huge influence on your sensory perception of anything, be it wine, burgers, tea, chocolate, etc.  Many, shall we say, \"anti-wine tasters\", cite the often linked article on a wine tasting panel describing red wine characteristics while tasting a white wine with food coloring.  Thus, the pitchforks come out and wine tasting is clearly a sham.  But let's think about it for a moment.  As scientists, we have to ask ourselves what the study was trying to achieve in the first place.  Were the authors trying to disprove wine tasting?  Not in the slightest.  They were attempting to show that the visual has as much of an influence on our sensory perception as the physical does - smelling, tasting, touching.  We see something and we judge it and *expect* certain qualities based off of the visual.  If Burger King all of a sudden started boosting the visuals of their burgers, we would see a massive increase in customer satisfaction with the *flavors*, even though the ingredients are the same.  Consumers enjoy their food more when it looks a certain way.  The white-to-red study absolutely succeeded in showing that our human brain is influenced by *visuals* - but that's where the conclusions should end.  No where in the published paper do the authors challenge wine tasting, they merely point out that the color of a wine influences the way our brain interprets the chemistry.

All of the listed descriptors can be linked to a either a specific sensory compound or a matrix of multiple interactions which are found in wine.\n\n**Cheesey** - Combine diacetyl, the quintessential butter flavor found in wine and movie popcorn, a creamy mouth-feel from lipid (fat) molecules released from yeast cell membranes, and a toasted nut flavor from the charred oak barrel and what you get is a flavor pretty close to some cheese.  Wine and cheese also share sulfur compounds responsible for the funkier cheeses like blue and Gorgonzola.  The number of common flavor/aroma compounds in wine and cheese is pretty staggering.\n\n**Metallic** - Author points to past winemaking techniques but there is unfortunately very little scientific literature available to substantiate that claim.  In my opinion, the tasters were perceiving the product of a long oxidative process.  170 years is a long time for the ocean's dissolved oxygen to enter through the cork and react with the champagne.

All of the listed descriptors can be linked to a either a specific sensory compound or a matrix of multiple interactions which are found in wine.\n\n**Cheesey** - Combine diacetyl, the quintessential butter flavor found in wine and movie popcorn, a creamy mouth-feel from lipid (fat) molecules released from yeast cell membranes, and a toasted nut flavor from the charred oak barrel and what you get is a flavor pretty close to some cheese.  Wine and cheese also share sulfur compounds responsible for the funkier cheeses like blue and Gorgonzola.  The number of common flavor/aroma compounds in wine and cheese is pretty staggering.\n\n**Metallic** - Author points to past winemaking techniques but there is unfortunately very little scientific literature available to substantiate that claim.  In my opinion, the tasters were perceiving the product of a long oxidative process.  170 years is a long time for the ocean's dissolved oxygen to enter through the cork and react with the champagne.  Think of the flavor of a coin or weathered metal object and you won't be far off.\n\n**Grilled** - Synonymous with char or burned.  These are common descriptors for the various toasted oak compounds extracted into wine during storage and aging.  \n\n**Spicy, smokey, leathery, animal, wet hair** - My favorites!  These are common descriptors of the yeast *Brettanomyces* and *Dekkera*!  *Brettanomyces* and *Dekkera* produces a number of compounds, including 4-ethylphenol (4-EP), 4-ethylguaiacol (4-EG), and acetic acid, which can contribute all of these descriptions to a wine (and beer!).  Another fun fact; 4-EP and 4-EG are also found in smoke from a fire!\n\nEdit for clarification:  *Brettanomyces* and *Dekkera* are nearly identical yeast species, however, \n*Dekkera* produces spores, *Brettanomyces* does not.  \n\n**Honey** - As Dr. Waterhouse mentions in the article, the champagne had a great deal of sugar in it.  As a descriptor of wine, honey can refer to a viscous mouth-feel, high perceptible sweetness, oxidized sugar, or a combination of any three. \n\n**Fruit** - Easiest component to identify.

The market value of a slave was simply much less in the region than in the American South because of this. You paid more there, because you expected to get more, and you had to keep them alive longer to do it because your cash crops were simply not as ridiculously valuable and in demand as sugar. Valuable, yes, but not THAT valuable. \n\nSlaves in the Caribbean knew what was coming, the ones in the fields, they knew they would inevitably die, and probably sooner rather than later.

On the other hand the reason bullets would often go over the heads of enemies especially at closer distances, was the loading process. After firing, the musket would immediately be brought up tight under the armpit and tilted up in order to re-prime the pan in order to fire again, but because of both the length of the barrel and the extremely slow speeds of the balls, the barrel would have already been partially tilted upwards by the time the ball exited (partially due to what you said, the extremely fast training of the soldiers).
