You specifically mentioned NYC, so I'll talk about that.  Winds that might bring air from the SE into NYC would generally produce high RH due to the air mass located in the Mid-Atlantic (warm, moist; generally called mT or maritime tropical).  Winds that bring air from the North Atlantic will still bring in moist air, but less so than those from the Mid-Atlantic because it is cooler (colder temps = less moisture the air can hold).  Wind coming off the main continent will generally be drier, but there are a number of factors that influence how dry or moist the air is (again, where is the air coming from? Region with heavy precip, from Gulf of Mexico, etc).\n\nDue to its proximity to the ocean, NYC would probably see at least moderate dew points, or rather higher than those inland.  It's relatively difficult to get a relative humidity below 40% (not exact, just ballpark) along coastlines due to the moisture from the nearby water. Will NYC see that whole range? I honestly don't know (I don't pay particular attention to NYC as I don't live there).
