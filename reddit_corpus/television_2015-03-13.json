If that weren't true, cinemas would have lost to straight-to-DVD and gone out of business decades ago.\n\n&gt; Unless Movie B is the Avengers or Star Wars -- something that's guaranteed to sell out no matter what -- it's safer to bet on Movie A.\n\nWhy are you so sure the seats won't sell? There is no reason to assume this. People go to the cinema for the experience of it, not just to get access to movie theater's newer movie selection (compared to, say, Netflix).\n\n&gt; If you're the *only* theater showing the boycotted movie, you may have a competitive advantage.\n\nIndeed - a tragedy of the commons would exist between theaters participating in a boycott, as each one would stand to gain individually by 'giving in', but they (in their view at least) all stand to gain if no-one 'breaks ranks'.\n\n&gt; There was one in my city, and my wife and I got a babysitter and planned a whole night around going to see it.

Personally, my movie-theater-going is motivated largely by the fact that it's a big-screen and, well, it's a bit of an event (as silly as that sounds).

I have 800+ cable channels in my home. We only view 25 of them. I've flipped around trying to find new shows and channels to watch and never find anything new or interesting. If I could pay a buck or two per channel that would be amazing.  ", "aSentId": 22307, "answer": "But that's just it, you would pick the channels you love, but no one would pick a channel that could end up producing the next BIG show like Breaking Bad. Let's take FX for example. If a la carte was available, how many people would have picked FX ten years ago? Probably not many. But then they make It's Always Sunny and it's a popular show which gains them advertising dollars and viewers and they can make even more shows like The League. But none of that is possible if no one has the channel. The content won't get created. \n\nAnd while you think you're buck or two would be enough, what happens if not enough people choose channel and it goes under? You may think your channels are safe, but look at what the most watched shows on cable are and you'd realize that channels like Science Channel, FX, TBS, AMC, etc would probably get close to shutting down in favor of Bravo, E! and TLC with their reality shows. As it stands right now, popular shows you think are shit, are actually subsidizing your channels and shows since they are all in a package.\n\nCut out the package and only the highest rated shows will remain. And unless you like Keeping Up With the Kardashians, I don't think many of the shows you enjoy would be around.\n\nWhat would end up happening is you'd either have to pay even more for less popular channels to keep them supported... OR the most popular channels would be charged at a premium. Not to mention, I don't think cable is losing enough customers that they need to scramble to change how the entire infrastructure is set up. They would probably end up losing a lot more customers who didn't know how to pick and choose channels not to mention spending millions to getting the word out and educating people about how to use the system, setting up call centers for questions regarding the change, informing customers what shows are on what channels, setting up pricing models, making new deals with the networks and channels. Honestly this would cost a major cable network hundreds of millions to pull off, they would probably end up getting LESS money from customers each month, and all this just to gain back a couple hundred thousand people who are cutting the cord and moving to streaming online options. Believe me, if Comcast stood to gain from a la carte cable, they would be doing it. \n\nRemember what a nightmare it was to get everyone switched to Digital Cable?

I don't know how or why you dismiss that, it covers basically (almost) exactly what you seem to be talking about.\n\nThe other stuff, well, you're talking about some other series, not star trek. Star Trek does not have four legged klingons. Maybe read the Culture series, it's light years better than star trek ever was, and deals with similar issues. Star trek is really just a very bland sci fi juke box, good at taking other types of stories and transplanting them into it's own very safe, very conservative universe. People that don't read enough science fiction tend to put it on a pedestal that it doesn't deserve. I say that as someone who really likes star trek.

Star Trek is not really about aliens. Star Trek is about humans. All the aliens are just representations of humanity in different states. Some very few aliens are more exotic, but they're typically less well explained because, well, they have to be. I'm sure future shows could integrate more realistic aliens, but I think to recast all of the humanoid aliens as realistic versions would actually hurt the universe at this point. These races have been developed into something of their own, yes they are just humans with funny bumps on their heads, but their identity which is very much tied to their being humanoid. Throwing that out would be losing a lot of what makes star trek work. And to be honest, mass appeal would undoubtably be negatively affected by making that change. People wouldn't like it. Not fans, not the general audience. The general audience is extremely conservative and doesn't like things that look \"hokey\". Most of them still think Battlestar Galactica was a triumph because it managed to be not imaginative at all (in the sense that they just said colonial society is a virtual duplicate of our own with all the same social issues). Bottom line, asking McDonalds to start selling gourmet foods is just a silly waste of time. Entirely different market.\n\nNow Farscape, well, that was a show that had using realistic puppets as aliens in it's DNA. It's a better and more interesting show in most regards too. Watch that, if you haven't.\n\nAs for getting good sci fi on the screen, don't hold your breath. Books are still, and likely always will be, the best place for sci fi. Shows are expensive to produce and sci fi is a niche market. Good sci fi that isn't just cliches shooting lasers at each other is even more niche. There's plenty of great shows that you haven't seen, most of which got cancelled because they looked \"too weird\". Read books and catch up on old series. Honestly, Farscape is a very enjoyable and interesting series which diverges nicely from Treks cliches and features really alien aliens. Advocate for that to be brought back, if anything.
