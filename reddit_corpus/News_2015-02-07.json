If that couple is planning on living in that house the rest of their lives anyway, what's the huge problem? Their payments and timeframe for paying the house off doesn't change with the market (unless they planned poorly and made a gamble/bet on future markets).  So life goes on as normal, no?  If they walk away/bankruptcy then they're certainly not getting another house anytime soon and that means 10 years of paying rent somewhere instead of that house payment.  Let's say  that rent is the same as their house payment was.  Are they better off now? They still have no equity - but now also are renting instead of owning, plus have bankruptcy to deal with.  To what ends? After 10 years being able to start over and buy a different house and make payments for however long again before the hope of building equity - and once again assuming the market doesn't turn against them again?  I can see that working out, but man oh man I don't fault those people for having a tough time swallowing a pill that says forget the next 20+ years of your home finances so we can hope for the best for the remaining years (assuming you're not dead or in a retirement home by then)","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l","qSentId": 2383,"question": "10 years of no house or car, and possibly no job?","aSentId": 2384,"answer": "Not all apartments require a credit check","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l","qSentId": 2385,"question": "Not all apartments require a credit check","aSentId": 2386,"answer": "Yeah, you have a ton of ghetto ass apartments you could choose from.

An infant in the first 6 months of life will get the same amount of aluminum in their shots as is found in half to a quarter of a aspirin tablet.

I'm not questioning your comfort level with today's vaccine schedule, because today's vaccine schedule will change. New vaccines and additional doses are added all the time. children today receive as many as 49 doses of 14 vaccines before they reach age six, which is roughly 12 times higher than the number of vaccines administered to children back in 1940. With more than 220 new vaccines in the developmental pipeline for children and adults...and no end in sight..the question you must ask yourself is ARE YOU CERTAIN you will be 100% comfortable with vaccines that are added to the mandated list in the future? If you say that yes, you're comfortable, then you're either a) not expecting to be a parent or grandparent, b) don't have to worry about it because your kids are grown and out of the house, or c) lying to prove a point. No critical thinker, no honest person, would ever sign off on the sight-unseen vaccine schedule of the future. And yet that's what you're doing when you condemn the people who are fighting for your right to refuse. YOU have the right to refuse, should you ever choose to use it, because the very \"anti-vaccine\" people you demonize have been fighting for us all. Right now, the burden of \"herd immunity\" falls on small children, but that is changing. Vaccine manufacturers see an untapped market in adult vaccines and are coming for you next. What will you do if your state, your employer, or your insurance company forces you to get a vaccine that you simply don't want? It hasn't happened to you yet, but if the right to refuse is eroded, it will happen to you sooner than you might think. Who then will you turn to? Your legislators who get campaign donations from pharmaceutical companies? The CDC that has former pharma executives sitting on the board? Who will you turn to if you ever want to say no? There will be no one. Once we enter the slippery slope of removing and individual's right to refuse medical procedures that carry a risk of injury or death, once we remove an individual's right to speak for him/herself and his/her children, we open ourselves up to an insidious new era, where other drugs and other procedures can be mandated.

Sounds great, right? But many of us carry genes that will never be expressed. You could be a carrier of that gene. Or your child could be a carrier. So if we follow the \"for the greater good\" mentality behind vaccines (or the Nazi's \"for the greater good\" mentality behind eugenics (breeding out illness), we are looking at forcing people who may never express a sociopathic gene to take antipsychotics, just in case. Because that's what forced vaccination does. It asks children who may never come into contact with a particular virus to accept a vaccine just in case. And that's what eugenics was all about. It sterilizes people who can pass on a genetic disease just in case. Forced vaccination is a human rights violation, and to support it when you know that the government's own Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System exists and lists people who have died as a result of vaccines is unethical at best, sociopathic at worst. The ethical thing to do is to allow people their right to refuse and leave it up to doctors and big pharma (who have marketing budgets larger than the GDP of some countries) to do a better job of convincing parents that vaccines are safe. We can start by reversing the law that grants vaccine manufacturers total immunity from vaccine injury lawsuits. Because as it stands, you can't sue a vaccine manufacturer if your child is injured or killed by a vaccine, even in cases where they could've made a safer vaccine and chose not to or when they failed to recall a contaminated lot# in a timely manner.

I'm not questioning your comfort level with today's vaccine schedule, because today's vaccine schedule will change. New vaccines and additional doses are added all the time. children today receive as many as 49 doses of 14 vaccines before they reach age six, which is roughly 12 times higher than the number of vaccines administered to children back in 1940. With more than 220 new vaccines in the developmental pipeline for children and adults...and no end in sight..the question you must ask yourself is ARE YOU CERTAIN you will be 100% comfortable with vaccines that are added to the mandated list in the future? If you say that yes, you're comfortable, then you're either a) not expecting to be a parent or grandparent, b) don't have to worry about it because your kids are grown and out of the house, or c) lying to prove a point. No critical thinker, no honest person, would ever sign off on the sight-unseen vaccine schedule of the future.

YOU have the right to refuse, should you ever choose to use it, because the very \"anti-vaccine\" people you demonize have been fighting for us all. Right now, the burden of \"herd immunity\" falls on small children, but that is changing. Vaccine manufacturers see an untapped market in adult vaccines and are coming for you next. What will you do if your state, your employer, or your insurance company forces you to get a vaccine that you simply don't want? It hasn't happened to you yet, but if the right to refuse is eroded, it will happen to you sooner than you might think. Who then will you turn to? Your legislators who get campaign donations from pharmaceutical companies? The CDC that has former pharma executives sitting on the board? Who will you turn to if you ever want to say no?

Disposal regulations vary state by state (and also, I would assume, county by county), but in many places the landfill is the *ONLY* legal disposal avenue besides cremation for places like veterinary clinics or pounds which are left with dead animal remains which are unwanted by owners / unclaimed / stray.\n\nFirst of all, not all places have nearby facilities for animal cremation. The crematorium my hospital uses only opened three years ago, and it's the only one within a 500 mile radius. Up until that point, *every* body that was unwanted / unclaimed had to go to the landfill *BY LAW*.\n\nSecond, cremating animal bodies is very expensive - at my hospital we contract with the crematorium as a 3rd party to handle all of our cremations, and our *cost* (we pass on actual cost to the client, no markup) begins at $150 for a cat and can top $350 for a large dog. \n\nAt my hospital, we probably take in somewhere around 10 animal bodies per day. If the owner doesn't want to take the remains home with them for burial, we are legally obliged to have them cremated or dispose of at the landfill. I would estimate that the number of clients who take their pets' remains home with them to be about 60%. So that leaves us with 4 bodies per day to dispose of, on average (that's a lowball figure, as it doesn't include things like unclaimed road traffic accident victims, etc). As I said above, our *cost* for cremations ranges from $150-350 each - so at $250 per, on average, and 4 bodies per day, my hospital would be losing $1000 *PER DAY* if we had to cremate all bodies. And my hospital is relatively small (3 vets) - at large practices that figure would be much higher! And if we're losing that much money, costs to clients for everything else are going to go up - and no one wants that. \n\nNB - some animal crematoriums offer mass cremation, which is one way to keep costs down, but from colleagues I've spoken to costs still average about $40 per animal. The crematorium we use is not equipped / permitted to perform mass cremations (crematorium equipment is incredibly expensive, hence the high cost - the one we use supposedly cost just north of $1 million to get up and running).

The intention is to remove the carcasses from the food chain and the potential for contamination. The regulation is supposed to ensure that, but execution many times falls flat. Which is why we (persons in charge of animal care and welfare, as well as the general public) are supposed to be well read and dedicated to the intention of animal care be it domestic or wildlife. Unfortunately, the regulations are much older than our understanding of how groundwater works and how poisons linger in the environment. Add that to faulty execution and you realize there is no good way to dispose of hazardous materials. Especially not one available to every animal care facility. The places I worked at collected carcasses until they had one or two freezers full and then contacted hazardous waste because we could not afford a proper cremation facility that would ensure the complete containment and destruction of tissue. Going to the dump was within our meager budget, and was really the safest route available.\n\n In a perfect world, we would have a painless and respectful euthanasia method, that would render the carcass chemically inert. One that would let us be rid of poisons entirely. Until then, we strive to fulfill the first part, then mitigate the consequences. \n\nYou are very welcome for the info, I sincerely hope this thread and associated article dissuades people from ever using poisons to kill animals, and gives folks an understanding of why we currently use barbiturates for euthanasia of domestic animals and the complications associated with that decision.\n\nI can go at length about this, and can point you towards bunches of literature if you want.

But even if you could be convinced this is all you're doing, you'd be fine with that, because you don't want people to go faster than you think they ought to go, regardless of safety considerations.  You really just want to set the rules for people and pat yourself on the back for being their benevolent master.  So if you could be convinced all you're doing is lining cops' pockets which is impossible, but if you could, you'd still be for it, because you'd take a certain smug satisfaction in people who might dare to defy your preferences getting fined and hassled.\n\nThat's the nature of people like you.  They parrot false arguments about safety to back up what's really just a desire to control people, and even the facts bear it out that they have no leg to stand on, they support it anyway as a form of revenge.\n\nYou're no different than someone saying \"Yeah but marijuana needs to be illegal, for the safety of the children, because you shouldn't smoke pot.\"  Absolutely not different.
