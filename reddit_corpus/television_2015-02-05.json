Unrelenting in tone, True Light: A, superior, take, unto, the, premier, haloing, of, tenuation. Readily, available, True Light, provides, resource, into, time's, motifed, and, vestuved, authenticate, revelation centers on a young Ecuadorian donkey tamer thrust into insufferable Marxist warfare circa 1960s Columbia.\n\nAnd boy oh boy, what a read... Enjoy your Pulitzer, Miss Voorhies.\n\nThis is quite simply the greatest book ever written, of all time, by a margin so wide that no book penned passed this point could even remotely compare. You want a difficult read? This book makes Ulysses look like a Tyler Perry screenplay. You want commas? You're in luck, because this book has more commas than words. It has so many commas I thought my book was raining. The commas broke my Kindle, which is a relief, because I'll never have to read again until the universe reaches maximum entropy. It's that good.\n\nI mean look at the title - there are words there that didn't even exist until Lark summoned them onto print. Genius. You know who else creates words out of thin air? Babies. And what is a baby if not God's opinion that the world should go on. Carl Sandburg said that, and I believe it's the underlying motif of Voorhies chef d'oeuvre.\n\nIn summation they should have really followed up on that episode where Zack and Lisa started dating\"","aSentId": 564,"answer": "I paused every comma","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh6e","qSentId": 566,"question": "Holy shit.

So you apply at your local Starbucks, you get the job and you start working.\n\nThen you meet one of your coworkers, this super hot 20 ear old girl, has a nose piercing, some tats, you fall head of over heels for her, she doesn't for you, but she is nice, she talks to you, jokes around with you, then she says she and her friends are having a party you should come, you haven't told her your 17, so you show up to the party, you drink, fuck around, the people there like you, but they don't know you are that young.\n\nThe girl then flirts with you, and you then flirt back, but then suddenly her boyfriend who is 26, has major tats and muscle, shows up out of nowhere, sees this and immediately starts threatening to pummel your ass into the ground, the girl then starts telling him to chill, you were just talking, then she says you are always like this to her boyfriend, she storms out, he follows her outside, they argue, he slaps her, you run up and say hey wait, then he starts beating on you outside, you lose horribly, his girlfriend pulls him off you. You're lying there bleeding a bit, the guy books it.\n\nYou go back inside to ice your face with the girl, she kisses you, then suddenly the cops show up because of a noise complaint, they card the people there, you're underage and drinking, they arrest you, bring you home to your parents saying he was drinking with some older kids and he is underage, all your neighbors see the police car and you. Your mom and dad get are horribly disappointed in you, your sister thinks it's funny.\n\nAnd that is the end of episode one.\n\nBasically the CW treatment is forced added drama that would never happen in real life, in circumstances that don't happen, to emotions that don't exist.\n\nPlus everyone is 25 something superhot, even though they play the \"average\" guy. There are always love triangles, girl with the wrong guy, who should be with the main guy, then main guy who has this friend who is a girl, who he doesn't notice for the beauty she is.\n\n**So why is it bad?** because Green Arrow is an orphan, his parents died in a plane crash or some shit, he gets stranded on an island, then comes back. He has no family, he has one mission, to save his city. He doesn't have a younger sister with daddy issues.\n\nHe is a man with a mission, and the CW added 70% drama filler, with awkward moments, hard relationship choices, love triangles, family issues, emotional baggage,","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh6e","qSentId": 2438,"question": "I can't believe how badly they messed up the flash.

He's a blind lawyer who has fairly weak super powers compared to the likes of Thor or the Hulk. He's always been a 2nd tier character, but that's his appeal. He's the underdog. No one expects DD to do much really. He's a street level \"super hero\" in a world where there are gods and magic.\n\nBut again, that's where the appeal comes in. In the comics he regularly held his own against much higher powered foes than him. He's bested the Punisher, fought toe-to-toe with Captain American, gave Namor a run for his money and can keep up with Spider-Man.\n\nHowever with the tone of this trailer and I'm sure the focus of law, this won't be a kid's show. This is definitely darker and while still in the MCU, probably won't be mentioned anywhere else. This was usually the case in the comics whenever a large cross over event occurred. He's a street level super hero that stays in Hell's Kitchen. Most events pass him by, and sometimes even by choice. Of course he will pop up from time to time. But for those wanting him to come up in other movies, think about how Hawkeye wasn't even in Captain America 2, and he's in the Avengers.","aSentId": 3087,"answer": "He could show up in civil war though.

It could just be like when a character is said to be Russian and does something Russian like asking for vodka or stands out in the cold. Or a character is introduced as English and wears something cozy in a parlor and offers tea. Or a character's mother is introduced, but before that, they make sure you know the character is Jewish. Or a mother-in-law is about to visit. It could just be meant to make you make assumptions about the character on purpose.\n\nIt helps provide context for what sort of person he was or is or will be. It's part of how he was raised, and for a vigilante, what sort of moral code and beliefs he holds is kind of important.

He's a lawyer, he's Catholic. If you have some stereotypes about lawyers and Catholics, you probably get an idea what to expect.
