They were slower at carrying weapons, and at the end they called in a guy who was in peak physical condition.

Building a battle ready bot was just a small piece of it all; transporting it (pre 9/11) and the tools required to repair it, recharge the NiCADs (NiMHs were too pricey back then), reassembling/testing it for inspection in the pits with the hassle of your remote having to be checked out for just minutes of use, getting queued for the three minute fight, then having as few as twenty minutes to get ready for the next fight...\n\nThese things are what made BB interesting to me. It wasn't just a cleverness test to see who could build the best bot based on the rules, it was an endurance test. Holding a whirring, deadly machine together you built in your garage (I built mine in a bathroom, long story), shipped, reassembled, past inspection, and made it into the ring was the real challenge.\n\nFrom the emails I've received to 'apply' to compete again and from what I've read this new iteration is more of a reality show than competition. I suspect they're only using the BB moniker for name recognition, unfortunately. It's a shame, too as I think a full blown old style BB show could work again with some rule tweaks to help with the 'wedge' problem.\n\nEdit: Bil Dwyer and Traci Bingham were really nice people by the way.

That's the main reason I couldn't get into The Newsroom; I felt like I'd already watched it before.  Very specifically, the pilot episode of The Newsroom, in which they scoop the BP oil spill, was essentially a reworking of the SportsNight episode \"Small Town,\" in which the crew similarly attempt to piece together a hot news story based on small scraps of information.  It didn't help that a lot of the overarching elements are heavily borrowed from SportsNight as well: the Emily Mortimer character is almost unchanged from the Felicity Huffman character, the romance between the two young news people, whoever they were, feels a lot like the incipient romance between Jeremy and Natalie... and like all Aaron Sorkin television shows, there is a lot of left-wing pontificating, although this was more judiciously used on SportsNight.\n\nI'm not saying The Newsroom isn't a quality show, or that it didn't evolve away from SportsNight after that first season, but it is very familiar.

They usually come from a minor or sometimes major character introduced in the original show that is very popular, so they get their own show. Kramer almost had his own spin-off after Seinfeld ended.  \n\nShows like Dragonball Z and Justice League Unlimited and all the Power Rangers shows are direct continuations of their previous shows, following the same characters. This means it's the same show, like you stated, even when they give it a new name. Spin-offs are new shows, often with new writers and a whole new cast and do not use the story of the last show other than establishing the characters and occasionally a crossover episode.
