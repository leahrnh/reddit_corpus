When someone's mental state is so warped and out of touch with reality, you can't talk about selfishness and reason anymore. The fact that many suicides reach out to those closest to them before going through with it is the ultimate act of courage and love for them. (For the record my best friend from childhood called me at home while i was on the way back from my grandpa's funeral - I missed his call and wonder if things could have ended differently. He then went out into the woods and killed himself that night. More recently my best friend has attempted suicide twice but reached out both times.

It was written by someone A) knew someone was lying dead at that address B) who sent it before knowledge of the murder became public information, ie, at a time when they thought the police didn't know, which means they had advance information C) wanted the body to be discovered but did not want their own identity to be discovered.

The most likely explanation as well is that the killer is someone close to her - why alert the police to her body unless you felt bad about it? It was also known that Berman allowed the killer into her house and turned her back on him prior to the shooting, suggesting that it was someone she allowed into her home and was familiar with.

The handwriting on the envelope and the Cadaver Note appear to the untrained eye as identical, as does his handwriting on many other documents found.

Durst was in California the few days surrounding the murder. Handwriting expert confirms that he wrote cadaver note, which was consistent with a friend having killed Berman, as was the crime scene.

This would mean that the letter he admitted writing could be suppressed, as wells his statements about the letter, and also his statements he made while he did not know he was being recorded!

You'd watch the season and forget about Yahoo Screen (which is not what they want). \n", "aSentId": 20124, "answer": "Yahoo is moving in the opposite direction of other, similar services. Binge-friendly release schedules are becoming more common so it seems backwards for them to jump into their service this way unless they believe Netflix is wrong in their belief about what consumers want.\n\nDrawing someone back to the site week to week doesn't change the math on how much they'd make from ads and most likely hurts it, because as you see with even network television shows that debut, viewership normally decreases from the week of the premier to the next weeks (It's pretty obvious to see why, if you're watching in order you don't see the fourth episode without previously seeing the third, and you don't see the third without previously seeing the second). Regardless, if I'm watching 10 hours of a TV show in a row or 10 hours spread across 10 weeks, I'm seeing the same number of ads.\n\nBringing me back week to week helps if it gets me to watch other shows on the service, but comes with the expectation that I'll watch the new episode of show 1 then the new episode of show 2,...etc. Most people I know don't just sit down to watch one half-hour show and move on to another, non-tv watching endeavor, they're usually settled in for a while. However, the same argument can be made if all your shows are released in a binge-friendly manor. I marathon one show, then the next time I feel like watching something I get back on and marathon the other. \n\nPeople saying that it is not trying to be or simply is not a competitor of Netflix seems simplistic to me. A few people said \"I like it when a show is released one episode at a time\" which is something I can't refute, it's a valid answer to why they would do it.  I prefer it to be released all at once and Netflix had data that told them that's the best method and so far they've done very well for themselves. My personal preference for binge-friendly releases and caveman comment has nothing to do with the reason I asked my question. If this was the way I preferred to receive my content I would still have the same question and find the answer of \"it's different because you don't pay for it\" just as unsatisfactory. \n\nMaybe they think this is a better way to build buzz for a show because some of Amazon's early offerings didn't generate the response OITNB and HOC did, but now Transparent has done very well for itself. Maybe they did it this way because it's simply easier for them to do or they didn't really even think about it or any number of other reasons. I was just wondering if anyone had actual insight.\n\nMe personally, and this has nothing to do with my question or answer to my question, but I'm likely not going to watch an episode of Community on Yahoo because I don't want to sit down in half-hour increments, that's not how I watch TV. By the time all the episodes are finally released there's a non-zero chance I'll just have forgotten about it and never get around to watching it on Yahoo or just watch it through some other, more familiar source.
