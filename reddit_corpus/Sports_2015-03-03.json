Blows to the head are bad, period. It may be true that in his case we can't say what was worse for him but the statement that \"it didn't help\" is factually accurate and meaningful in the context of a discussion about the level of damage he incurred in MMA.\n\nAs to Goodridge being a bad example, he may not be the best but he is certainly a former competitor suffering long term damage. With Liddell I am torn as to whether to think his problems are substance abuse or damage or perhaps some combination of both.\n\nWe aren't far enough in to make a long term judgment that is true. However we can make some predictions based on the long term outcome of participants in sports with similar parameters. We have seen that competitors in other striking sports are at a greater risk for neurological issues in the long term. The difference at this point I think is going to come down to volume. Are Mixed Martial Artists really taking that many fewer blows?\n\nThe logical answer would be that given the greater number of viable targets that they *should* be taking less blows to the head. However not all blows are equal. What difference do the gloves make? What about potential differences in the levels of energy imparted by the wider variety of strikes, is an elbow worse than a hook? What about the repetitive stress of short periods of oxygen deprivation to the brain due to chokes?\n\nAlso can we be for sure that fighters are really taking that many less blows? The most common method of stoppage is due to some form of strike, whether it be a clean knock out or a grounded opponent simply unable to defend any longer. Punches seem to be the most commonly used weapons and given that thus far most fighters neglect the body as a target for strikes it means that most are going to the head.\n\nWe can't really say for sure that they are taking that many less blows to the head.\n\nIf we are honest the best we can say at this moment is that we simply don't know what the long term outcomes are going to be like for these guys and what level of stresses their bodies are enduring.
