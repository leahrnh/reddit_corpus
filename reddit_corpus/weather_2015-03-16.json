Northern NZ only got a glancing blow from the outer reaches of the TC on the southwest side, so it's unlikely that they had much more than moderate rain (for a TC) and winds over 70 kph (roughly 45 mph).  It's important to remember a couple things: TCs in the southern hemisphere, the worst place to be is generally the left (relative to storm motion) side of the eyewall, as the maximum winds are located here.  TC wind intensity actually drops significantly as you move outside something called the radius of maximum wind.  Judging by the distance from the center (or what was left of the center of the TC as it dissipates) to where OP said he was located, It shouldn't be too much to assume that OP is doing alright barring some extenuating circumstance. Keep in mind that, while inland flooding can be a problem with TCs, the most dangerous part of most of these storms is the storm surge that they create, which is mostly a danger to those living fairly close to the coastline that are not tens of feet above sea level.\n\nThat being said, hope OP is doing well.

It didn't break the windows. It kinda popped them right out of the window openings.
