Nowadays if there's a game breaking bug or a broken area of a map that was overlooked during the testing phase, a developer can simply patch it. Sometimes this is useful if it's one or two small obscure bugs, like the Dragon Age: Inquisition AI conversation bug. AC: Unity, however, was unplayable on day one. Think about how bad that would have been 10 years ago. DA: Inquisition could have gotten away with it 10 years ago because the convo bug, while annoying and fairly widespread, didn't break the game, but AC: Unity? But now because the game was patched several times since release a significant amount of people seem content with forgiving it.

Publishing a game in its unfinished state is just a bad move for both the gamers and the developers. And ultimately also for the publishers.\n\nAs a side note, early access or preordering can be a good method to fund indie games that wouldn't be picked up by a publisher.

As someone who is a scientist who studies horses, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls horses UNICORNS. If you want to be \"specific\" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying \"horse family\" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Bovinae, which includes things from cows to  horses to donkeys. So your reasoning for calling a horse a UNICORN is because random people \"call the horned ones UNICORNS?\" Let's get pegasi and mules in there, then, too. Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A UNICORN is a UNICORN and a member of the horse family. But that's not what you said. You said UNICORNS,which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the bovine family crows, which means you'd call donkeys, horses, and other animals UNICORNS, too. Which you said you don't. It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh03","qSentId": 14151,"question": "I'm going to oust myself as a shallow gamer, but what game is that first cap?

They get to bring their own decks.","aSentId": 14323,"answer": "Just thought of a way to do this sort of - the rules may need to be shaped better but it's hard to figure out good rules conceiving it on the fly:\n\nSplit a standard deck in 2 (i.e. deal out face down 26 cards to each player - like war where neither player looks at their full cards dealt), then each player draws 7 cards to start the game. Your library is your life - running out of library = lose the game and that's the only way to lose.\n\nQuick note on hand size: Your hand size can't exceed 7 cards and you discard down to 7 at the end of each turn - whether it's your turn or not. As you'll see, you can have a hand of less than 7 cards even though you don't \"play cards\" but rather have combat where cards can be won or lost.\n\nA turn comprises of draw, combat and discard. Combat would be:\n\n- The person who's turn it is chooses to attack or not (if not, end turn). A player can't attack if they don't have at least 5 cards.\n\n- If they attack, they put together a 5-card hand and place it face down\n\n- The defender chooses whether to block or not. If they don't, the attack goes through (more on that later). A player can't block unless they have at least 5 cards.\n\n- If the defender blocks, they put together a 5-card hand and place it face down\n\n- To explain an attack that goes through can either destroy the top 1 library card if the hand is a pair or better OR the top 3 library cards if the hand is worse than pair or better. An attacker who is not blocked can choose to not reveal their hand and only destroy the top 1 library card. Not revealing keeps secrecy - you could instead reveal a pair or higher to essentially fuck with your opponent - i.e. either show a really strong hand and intimidate them into not attacking on their turn, OR show maybe a low pair and entice them to attack when your other 2 cards might make a considerably better hand. As a defender, letting them through might be a best option to either bide time while trying to build a better hand, or to make them think your cards are weaker than they are with the intention of winning the next combat.\n\n- To explain winning/losing combat: If you lose combat with your hand revealed, the winner gets to choose from the following: Destroy 2 cards in the loser's hand of the loser's choice, OR claim 1 card in the loser's hand of the winner's choice. Destroying 2 depletes the volume of the loser's hand more - if they can't put together a 5 card hand, they can't defend an attack and you can deplete their library pretty quickly at will, BUT claiming a card that would allow you to build better hands can help you win more combats. If you lose with your hand NOT revealed, the same choices apply but they are instead at random. You are getting the benefit of not showing your hand, and the winner loses some of the benefit of claiming a card (random choice vs. chosen choice) BUT if they choose to destroy 2 instead, you could lose 2 of your best cards.\n\n- Pre-Combat Muck Option: The attacker can choose to \"muck\" and either reveal their hand and it's treated as if the blocker won combat normally OR not reveal their hand and the blocker can either claim a card at random or have 2 cards destroyed at random. If the attacker doesn't muck, the defender has the same choice of whether or not to muck and whether or not to reveal the hand when mucking.\n\n- Initial Reveal and 2nd Muck Option: If neither player does a pre-combat muck, each player looks at their 5-card hand and chooses 3 cards. Only once both players have chosen 3 cards does each player then reveal the 3, so their hands are now 3 revealed cards and 2 hidden cards. At this point, there is another Muck Option for the attacker and then the defender.\n\n- Final Reveal and Combat: If neither player mucks, both players reveal their hands and the one with the best poker hand wins the combat.\n\nSo yea - have no idea how this would play out, but it seems like it could be interesting.\n\nEdit: One thought - to help keep from there being dead cards, I just thought of this notion: The cards that a player did NOT attack or block with MUST be used in the next turn's combat if there is one. So if I attack, then you attack next turn, I have to use the other 2 cards in my hand in the 5-card hand I put together. Not sure if it's necessary or not though.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh03","qSentId": 14244,"question": "They're playing Poker: the Gathering.
