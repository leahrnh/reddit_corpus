This judge is a federal district judge, the lowest judge in the federal court system.  Compare that with your example, Miranda v. Arizona, which  become mandatory binding authority when the Supreme Court issued their opinion. When interpreting the law, judges are pretty strongly tied to how other judges/justices have interpreted the law (jurisprudence.)  Again, as you go up the totem pole this restriction is reduced.\n\nEven if the judge made an activist ruling, despite those obstacles, her decision wouldn't change anything on a federal level. (Or even the state level.)  Federal district decisions are rarely cited for any type of legal argument, except for issues that simply don't make it to the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court.  Even when they are cited, they are almost always cited as persuasive authority because they simply lack the power to be binding mandatory authority on higher courts, or courts outside their jurisdiction. (Again, they're the lowest courts in their jurisdiction... they have nothing to bind.)", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l", "qSentId": 21479, "question": "Judges are there to interpret the law.

A section of the brain called the amygdala, which is responsible for emotional learning and memory; and the ventral tegmental area (VTA), responsible for dopaminergic projection, communicate through the brains reward centre. This triggers the release of dopamine, telling you what you did was good. The process can lead to inhibited dopamine receptors when the activity normally associated with the reward, doesn't actually trigger the reward. This occurs in drugs that the body builds tolerances to, such as heroin and crystal meth, but this occurs in a much lesser extent in pot users than even alcohol users. Theories suggest the chance of addiction is higher in those with fewer dopamine receptors, meaning that any inhibited receptors represent a bigger issue for the brains chemical reward centre.

The airlines only came out great because they were able to default their pension plans to the PBGC. GM was never going to be able to do this. Under the old system, you were able to skip pension payments because they were behind  secured creditors in BK order. United stalled their reorganization efforts, seemingly fine to operate in the red for years because they were creating a monster obligation that would force the judges hand. Once that pension plan was unfunded for 2+ years, and after many prior years of under funding from the Dotcom pop and 9/11, it was impossible for United to ever recover with that existing obligation. So what happens? They then move it to the PBGC where the benefits are cut by 1/3rd on average, which far exceeds the amount they were avoiding in payments during bankruptcy. \n\nOctober 12th 2006(I think that's the day), was the last day you could file under these old rules, which is what Delta and Northwest Airlines did, inevitably able to shed major pension costs to compete. After this change Chapter 11 requires a company to put forth a working reorganization plan within 180 days. This means GM or anyone won't have enough time to default their plans under Chap 11. If they don't have a plan in 180 days, the secured  creditors get to make the plan, which would have been terrible for GM. GM wanted to keep their brand assets and control over non-US markets. So knowing this, they started the lobbying effort for a government bailout to go along with Chap 11, the hitch was with the democrats in power, the UAW wasn't going to get the shaft.\n\n This is why GM is still largely not healthy even now, they got to get out of a ton of debts, but they never were forced to really reorganize their company more efficiently. The UAW took haircuts, but it was more than made up by the fact they were given a large stake in the new lower debt GM, which violated conventional bankrupcy priority as union pensions/credit claims are supposed to come after secured creditors, who got the shaft in the GM bailout.

LucasFilms submitted a \"precise development plan\" for Grady in 2009.\n\nWell, some busy-body neighbors resurrected a defunct homeowners\u2019 association in the summer of 2012.\n\nIn November, the association and others sent a letter to Mr. Lucas requesting that he \n&gt;\"find a far more appropriate location for the development.\"\n\n&gt; **\"The proposed expansion of LucasFilms in the so-called \"Lucas Valley\" poses a serious and alarming threat to the nature of our valley and our community.  It would dwarf the average Costco warehouse and generate light pollution so that our dark starry skies would be destroyed.\"** \n\nThe association hired an environmental consultant and a lawyer to review what impact the new studio would have and they also alerted the county to questions that state and federal authorities had raised about Lucasfilm\u2019s plan to restore a creek in the valley.\n\nA few days later, Lucasfilm pulled the project because they feared a possible lawsuit by the residents would delay construction indefinitely and waste money needlessly.\n\nA local lawyer and supporter of the LucasFilm expansion, Jeffrey Tanenbaum, challenged the legitimacy of the homeowners\u2019 association, arguing that they did not follow bylaws when they reorganized.  Mr. Tanenbaum sent board members an 18-point letter questioning their authority, which freaked them out - more than a little bit - and they reached out to Mr. Tanenbaum to have a sit down meeting. \n\nAfter some conversations and some red wine and cheese, Mr. Tanenbaum asked the HOA board memembers to step down.  While the Board members said their association was legitimate, one member had resigned by the time of meeting and another one was preparing to step down, meaning the HOA board no longer had the minimum number of members needed to make it a legally recognized HOA.\n\nInstead of building the expansion, Lucas picked an established philanthropic group, \"The Marin Community Foundation\", to develop affordable housing on Grady Ranch instead.\n\nThe president of the \"MCF\", Thomas Peters, said in 2012 that while some of the nation\u2019s wealthiest people live here, the county is also home to a number of people struggling to live in an inflated real estate market. \n\nAccording to statisics from 2012, **a family of four with an annual income of $88,800 could qualify for housing assistance in Marin.  The county had about 6,500 income-restricted housing units.**\n\nMr. Tanenbaum said in an interview, \"It\u2019s likely that if affordable housing were to be built in the neighborhood, it would have a negative impact on property value. But that\u2019s not a major factor for me. Affordable housing has to go somewhere.\"\n\nTom Taylor, one of the members of the homeowners' association board, said that crafting a response to Mr. Lucas's housing proposal was very difficult.\n\n**\"I would say probably everybody has reservations about it, but nobody\u2019s going to come out and say they don\u2019t want it. Everybody probably felt that he did it just for spite, but after thinking about it for a while, I guess I\u2019d have to say that probably the site is better suited for affordable housing than it was for the project he was intending to put there.

Yes, a black kid and a white kid of equal socio-economic class will have different upbringing.  My exact same childhood would've been quite different if I had been black.  HOWEVER, Will Smith's kids are a goddamn lot better off than I am.  Being of a certain race doesn't automatically guarantee you a certain childhood.  I know lots of black kids that have never been exposed to \"the hood\" and I know lots of white kids that don't think college is realistic for them.  In my experience, it has far less to do with race and more to do with socio-economics.\n\nHaving said that, is there a racial divide in the US?  Absolutely.  There are far more poor black people than white people.  I won't argue that for a second.  And as a result, there are stereotypes and reactions to said stereotypes (aka racism).

This is why in racial discussion groups you find that persons of color (I am not a fan of this phrase) and white people are put into seperate groups at the start.
