But drag has a large effect on baseball velocity. (Terminal velocity for a baseball at sea level is 74 mph.) So by the time the ball gets to the outfield, it's moving slowly enough that it could probably, usually be caught safely by someone who had an intuitive physical understanding of the situation. \n\nIn that situation, you'd probably instinctively use two hands moving in the direction of the ball's motion, to decelerate the ball as slowly as possible over the widest possible surface area.

I just appreciate your openness to being educated!\n\nYeah, field of play is 360 degrees as opposed to the one hundred and twenty that I think baseball has.\n\nPositioning before the bowl is also important with cricket. I read somewhere else in the thread that the bowler would've told certain people where to stand because he was going to bowl in a particular fashion to encourage certain shots and force certain errors. Also you're totally right re: effective contact vs. directional hitting. Normally if a batsman makes effective contact on a ball, a lot of the work getting it over the boundary will be done for him due to physics. He can just swing in to it a bit more for better distance.\n\nThe flat hitting surface makes the spin on a ball a lot more consistent. I know from experience playing softball in school that the round bats give you crazy amounts of spin if you hit the ball right on the edge, with cricket bats it's much more manageable, but you can still \"edge\" the ball with a cricket bat, it's just that generally you lose a lot of the power in the ball, making it easier to catch so you really want to avoid that.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qgzy", "qSentId": 7657, "question": "Yeah, I had the audacity to ask an honest question, apparently.\n\nThanks for taking the time to answer instead of just jumping at the down arrow like other people. \n\nI did notice from the way the ball came off the bat that it was hit behind, what would be a foul ball into the stands behind the plate in baseball, but I'm familiar enough with cricket to know the field of play extends considerably behind the batter, too. \n\nWhile there are certainly lofty fly balls that a player has plenty of time to position themselves for in a baseball outfield, positioning before the pitch is generally a much greater factor, I would think.

One thing about cricket is, both direction and contact go hand in hand. Direction, is all about hitting each bowl with the best shot type possible, as in to a particular area of the field. Depending on where the ball is bowled in relation to the batsman..at the body or wide of the body, landing halfway down the pitch or right on the batters toes, fast or slow.. there is generally a correct shot type for each ball. \n\nThen obviously, for that shot to be more effective, you want to have the ball coming off the middle of the bat. If it hits the edge, it can go straight up in the air or behind for a catch. Cricket typically has a wider variety of footwork for batters as well, with different shots needing different balance etc. \n\nAlso just on fielding, a lot of the best fielding isn't catches, but stopped runs. Think if someone in close to a batmans, like a shortstop, with less reaction time to stop the ball and save runs. To me, that's the best to watch outside of catches.\n\nIf you want to watch some YouTube, I can give you some great videos.
