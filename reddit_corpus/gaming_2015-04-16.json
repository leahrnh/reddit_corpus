Relative to inflation, games haven't changed in price in what, 30 years? And some have nine digit budgets when they used to be built by a dozen people. That this makes economic sense is a matter of scale and reach, and DLC. \n\nFor a lot of people, the base game is enough. And $60 is a lot for a game. For others, $60 is relatively cheap based on entertainment value per hour, so the idea of paying more to get more makes perfect sense (I'm into under 0.25 per hour for Dragon Age, and even buying an absurd amount of DLC for CK2 I'm still well ahead of that.)\n\nTo those users, you offer more experiences and additional replay value. They can decide later, or pick up everything as a special edition up front. And they're paying a premium because not everyone values that extra content enough to buy the whole game priced to reflect that delta. \n\nAs a game buying consumer, I'm generally happy to pay more for a fuller, richer experience. I recognize that the base game is really just the stripped down base model. If I want the full experience I'll pay more for that. But not enough people would be okay with game prices jumping to $85 and all DLC included.  Just like car manufacturers have to hit a specific base model value even if everyone goes up a notch or three.\n\nAnd ultimately, a lot of us come out ahead, because games we buy DLC for are the ones we play the most of.

Without glitching the game itself, you could not get it. Mew was originally added to be something game masters could give out at events.\n\nThe myth version was that you went on the S.S. Anne to get your HM but let the ship captain guy kill you. That made it so you could move forward with the game but the ship wouldn't leave. Then later in the game when you got the HM that pushed large objects, you were supposed to go to the shore where S.S. Anne was parked and push a truck that was randomly sitting there. Sadly, after all that work, there was no Mew there.\n\nThe only way to get it without a game genie or cheating device is a long process of not triggering certain trainers in the world. Pokemon used a specific hex sequence to pick which pokemon showed up in certain areas. If you did this method correctly, you could glitch the game to have a Mew attack you.
