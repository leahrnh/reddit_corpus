The story of Eden was written to explain these things (and convey certain ethical/moral/mythological/spiritual implications, it isn't like Genesis becomes nothing but meaningless hogwash in the face of scientific thought), rather than these things coming to be on account of the events of the story. That's the real reason God didn't just hide the Tree, because then either the end result would be humans as little more than animals rather than the modern day, or the result would be the same (humans eating from the Tree) but carry very different implications coming from God not telling humanity about the option, humans not knowing they weren't allowed to eat from the tree, the snake not fitting as well, God not being able to properly hide something from pre-Knowledge humans, etc.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l", "qSentId": 10395, "question": "I definitely wouldn't consider myself an expert on religion but to my understanding the snake tricked eve into eating from the tree of knowledge (original sin).

In addition to the ridiculous comments in here, the fact that this post got upvoted this high demonstrates how completely ignorant your average reddit user is of the government works and how devoid the average user is of common sense.  Firstly, this says a single lawmaker FILED a bill.  This has not been enacted into law nor will it ever be.  It seems most people don't realize how insignificant a single state lawmaker is in a state that has as many as Texas does.  Also, the bill outlines COMPLETE deregulation of weed.  Nowhere in the country has that level of legalization been passed.  That would mean that there would be no special taxes or regulations whatsoever associated with weed more than any other crop.

Not just grandstanding but as a distraction for the shit they're actually passing.  \n\nThe author, David Simpson, also filed HB 1937 that would allow TSA agents to be arrested for \"offensive groping\".  It had 94 co-authors listed, from both parties and passed the House.  Then the DOJ shut it down, predictably, and it failed in the Senate.  \n\nIMHO HB 1937 was never intended to pass.  As much as we dislike TSA, they're not under state control and basically any search is \"excessive, offensive groping\" if you want to view it as such.  The DOJ said if Texas was banning TSA searches they they'd not be allowed to use the National Airspace (i.e. no commercial flights).  \n\nI'm sure Simpson knew this would never work, but the fact that it would never pass is what makes it such a win-win to do.  Get publicity, there's not actually a lot of negative public criticism because opposition knows it will never pass, and there won't be any negative effects because, of course, it never passes.\n\nBut I don't mind.

First of all, if the 60% *majority* finally realized their vote *does* matter then they could elect whoever they wanted. However, even if just many of them did, congressman from all sorts of parties would join the Senate and house. We have independents in congress already. Once this became more normal, it would be incredibly simple to elect independent presidents and congressman often. In order to keep up, the major parties must change their platform. They do this *very* often.\n\nYour vote *does* matter. The congressman elected during the 20s would roll in their graves to hear you say your vote doesn't matter.

So they run a tire on a machine for X amount of miles and estimate the mean and variance of the durability so they can make predictions.\n\nHowever, of course some things degrade with time. You may be asking, how do we go in the future? Actually, there is a whole field of statistics for this thing: survival analysis. If you want to understand the duration of a product and it has not exceeded it's lifespan, it is considered censored data. If you can correctly specify the probability model of observations and assumptions, survival analysis takes the most you can get from data and make predictions.\n\nThe combination of these ideas should be used in testing for reliability. Also, when someone designs a new washing machine, it isn't like they re-invented the whole thing. Assuming components are independent, there is plenty of data that can be used to estimate similar lifespans.\n\nThe company should perform the research.

There is a reason this is done for industrial and not personal.  Industrial products can typically be better estimated how often they will be used, and under what conditions.  Even if they are harsh conditions like being run 24/7 in an unairconditioned factory, it is intended for that, and charged accordingly.  \n\nNow for consumer products, take a juicer for example.  The person might use it daily to make juice for their family of 5 vs the person who uses it on the weekend for their self.  it can also heavily depend on what it is used to process.  Most non-commercial grade juicers that say they can handle things like wheatgrass or other extremely hard to juice vegetables will state recommended ratios to mix those with softer fruits while juicing to limit strain on the device.  A single abuse of the machine early on could take years off the products life down the road.  More expensive equipment with clearly defined ratings like force gauges will have an overload recorder that keeps a permanent count of the number of times the unit has been used beyond its rated capacity.  That way if a factory claims their product failed prematurely, it is easy enough for the manufacturer to verify if the product has been abused.  It would be cost prohibitive to install this level of error recording in all consumer products as it would quickly become cheaper to occasionally buy a new product than have this built into everything.\n\nduring product development, developers estimate how long a product should last if used properly, and how long it would last if abused in somewhat predictable ways.

In probably around 5th grade I had decided I was done taking those tests.  Each section of the test had a time limit, and after you were done, and if there was time left, you were allowed to read a book or put your head down or something like that.  Usually I would finish the test early, with above passing marks, usually B's and A's. It's easy to pass multiple choice questions when you narrow them down, and don't second guess yourself. Put the answer in, move on, turn the test in. Done. Well this day I had decided after the first hour of testing, that  all I wanted to do was read the andalite chronicles in peace.  So the next time the scantron was passed around, I silently, and randomly, filled in all the bubbles in record time. I turned my sheet over, pulled out my book, and the rest of the day was fantastic.  I don't remember how long it took for the results of the test to get back to the teachers, but when they did show up I was in huge trouble.  My counselor, principal, teacher, and other people I don't really remember all were standing around me in the hallway asking me questions and getting very angry with my answers.  \"Why did you do this?\" I wanted to read my book \"Don't you care how this looks on your record?\" No... \"We know you are smarter than this, do you think you are dumb\" No. \"Then why did you do this?\" I wanted to read my book... I almost was suspended, threatened to repeat the grade I was in. A few teachers thought that I had purposefully chosen the wrong answers to get such a low score.  This part had me confused, they thought I was intentionally trying to get the answers wrong? How low of a score had I gotten?  I finally got to see the results, and the first part of the test that I had actually taken, an english portion I believe, I received a score in the high 80-90%. The next test, and every other test, was in the low single digits, the highest score in that set was 6%.

Your perspective provides an important insight into what it's like for a student. To offer another perspective, the reason your teachers, admins, etc. were pissed is because their jobs are essentially on the line. Whenever I had a kid with low scores, I was basically pulled into an office and accused of not caring, not doing enough, etc. \"Well what are you going to do about it?\" was commonly thrown around. I even had a student miss 80 days of school (out of 180) and my boss asked me what I was going to do to help him make up all the work (graduation % is another statistic they care about). Teachers who couldn't get high marks are fired/reassigned. And the admins are necessarily evil about this stuff, it's that the people in the district office are doing the exact same thing to them. \n\nWho knew we'd care so much about a test score.

The circuit court will in turn judge the ruling from the lower federal court.", "aSentId": 19352, "answer": "Just to clarify ...\n\nThe U.S. has two different court systems. There are the state courts, and there are federal courts. State courts can interpret state laws and federal laws, although their interpretations of federal laws are not binding except to lower courts in that state (unless a federal court with the same territorial jurisdiction has had a different interpretation). Federal courts, however, are not to interpret state law, but should instead \"certify\" a question of state law to that state's highest court in order to have that question definitely ruled upon.\n\nThere are three levels of federal courts. The trial courts are the district courts, of which there is at least one in each state. Their jurisdiction is limited to \"federal questions,\" that is, issues of federal law, diversity matters--disputes in which the amount of controversy is above $75,000 and no plaintiff is a resident in any state in which any defendant is a resident. Then you have the circuit court of appeals, which hear appeals from the district courts in the states that make the circuit. Finally, there is the Supreme Court of the United States. To have a case heard by the Supreme Court, it must first go through the district and circuit courts or other limited routes (involving state courts and federal questions, suits between several states, etc). Even then, one must \"apply\" for SCOTUS to take the case through a writ of certiorari.\n\nFederal courts are not \"above\" state courts in the traditional way that phrase is used. While federal courts may, in certain circumstances, interpret state laws, their interpretation is not binding on the state courts unless it involves some federal rights or laws as well.\n\nIt sounds like you understand that, but I didn't want people to interpret your response as stating one could proceed directly from state court to federal court.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l", "qSentId": 19354, "question": "The SCOTUS will be ruling on this issue this term.

Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.\u201d\n\n7 \u201cWhy then,\u201d they asked, \u201cdid Moses command that a man give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?\u201d\n\n8 Jesus replied, \u201cMoses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning. 9 I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery.\u201d\n\n10 The disciples said to him, \u201cIf this is the situation between a husband and wife, it is better not to marry.\u201d\n\n11 Jesus replied, \u201cNot everyone can accept this word, but only those to whom it has been given. 12 For there are eunuchs who were born that way, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others\u2014and there are those who choose to live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.

The baby does not have a developed brain or the ability to think freely until sometime in the second trimester. If I am wrong on that, let me know. \n\nBut I still believe a woman should be allowed to make her own choice and not be forced to do something, just because that's what others believe.

My point in talking about this is to say that using \"It's against my religion\" as an argument to make something illegal should not be allowed, because our country was founded on the belief of separation of church and state. So stop using that because it's a bullshit argument. I'm perfectly fine with people using the argument that it's murder.

So who are you to decide to force a lifestyle down someone else's throat? By saying, that person cannot marry someone of the same sex because it's against my lifestyle, aren't you essentially doing exactly what you don't want? Someone forcing a lifestyle down your throat, but only you're doing it to them?\n\nAnd who's to say they are forcing this lifestyle down your throat? Are they saying just because same-sex marriage is allowed, then you need to be gay? No that's not what they are saying at all. It's about opening up the freedom of choice to pursue your own happiness. You shouldn't be allowed to dictate what makes other people happy, just because it would make you happy. \n\nAnd like I said, same-sex marriage doesn't even affect you. It's legal in the state I live. I never even notice anything. Oh two guys got married. I really don't give a shit because how does that affect my life? It's not like I'm going to all of a sudden fail my big math test because I saw two men holding hands. If it does affect you that much, then you need to stop focusing on other people.

If I am wrong on that, let me know. \n\nBut I still believe a woman should be allowed to make her own choice and not be forced to do something, just because that's what others believe. Like you said here \"I just don't want a lifestyle I disagree with on moral grounds to be forced down my throat and in to my life.\" So why do you get to force that lifestyle down other people's throats?\n\nAlso, if the argument is abortion is murder, I can totally get behind and see that as a valid argument. My point in talking about this is to say that using \"It's against my religion\" as an argument to make something illegal should not be allowed, because our country was founded on the belief of separation of church and state. So stop using that because it's a bullshit argument. I'm perfectly fine with people using the argument that it's murder. That's a valid point.\n\n&gt; I just don't want a lifestyle I disagree with on moral grounds to be forced down my throat and in to my life.\n\nAgain I'm bringing this back, because it's how you feel, it's how everyone feels. So who are you to decide to force a lifestyle down someone else's throat? By saying, that person cannot marry someone of the same sex because it's against my lifestyle, aren't you essentially doing exactly what you don't want? Someone forcing a lifestyle down your throat, but only you're doing it to them?\n\nAnd who's to say they are forcing this lifestyle down your throat? Are they saying just because same-sex marriage is allowed, then you need to be gay? No that's not what they are saying at all. It's about opening up the freedom of choice to pursue your own happiness. You shouldn't be allowed to dictate what makes other people happy, just because it would make you happy. \n\nAnd like I said, same-sex marriage doesn't even affect you. It's legal in the state I live. I never even notice anything. Oh two guys got married. I really don't give a shit because how does that affect my life? It's not like I'm going to all of a sudden fail my big math test because I saw two men holding hands. If it does affect you that much, then you need to stop focusing on other people. It's none of your damn business, and it's actually sad if something that small will ruin your life and clog your mind with thoughts about it.", "aSentId": 20581, "answer": "&gt;As I said before, a person in a coma is fully developed and has a brain and a life.

What they are referring to is a vote in the 2000 on Initiative 416, the Nebraska Marriage Definition Amendment, which provided \u201cthat only marriage between a man and a woman shall be valid or recognized in Nebraska, and to provide that the uniting of two persons of the same sex in a civil union, domestic partnership or other similar same-sex relationship shall not be valid or recognized in Nebraska.\u201d The amendment passed with 67.5% of voters saying \u2018yes\u2019 to the amendment.\n\n\nDetractors of the Governor's stance cite the changes in public attitude towards gay marriage over the last decade and a half. For example, the Pew Research Center says that public support for gay marriage has gone from 35% in favor in 2001 to 54% in 2014, while those against have gone from 57% to 39%. The reason, Pew says, is the differences in opinions of generations (for example, 68% of Millennials favor same sex marriage while only 48% of Baby Boomers do.) Indeed, Barna Group cites several OmniPolls where people of a variety of faiths and backgrounds have drastically changed their opinion on same-sex marriage over the last 10 years. (It should be noted that all of these figures are national polls, not polls within the state of Nebraska.) With that changing national sentiment, many are calling for another vote to decide the fate of Initiative 416.\n\n\nSo what does it take to repeal the law?\n\n\nThe amending of a state\u2019s constitution by public vote is called an \u2018initiated constitutional amendment\u2019, the rules of which are set out in Sections 2 and 4 of Article III of the Nebraska Constitution. To submit an amendment for public vote, a petition must be turned in 4 months before the next general election (2016) with the signatures of 10% of all registered voters in the state of Nebraska (it used to be only 10% of voters from the last gubernatorial election, but that requirement changed in 1994 via Duggan v. Beermann, 245 Neb. 907, 515 N.W.2d 788). Of that 10%, the signatures must be distributed as to include 5% of registered voters in two-fifths of the counties in the state. Once voted upon, the same measure can\u2019t be resubmitted for another 3 years and the Legislature cannot act upon the publicly-voted law, except upon a vote of at least two-thirds of all the members of the Legislature.\n\n\nThe whole process could be rendered moot if SCOTUS rules this summer that states cannot ban or refuse to recognize same-sex marriage. If SCOTUS rules against same-sex marriage, then petitioners have until early summer in 2016 to gather petitions for a vote. According to the Nebraska Secretary of State, there were 1.159 million people registered to vote in 2014. That means around 115,900 signatures need to be filed and 57,950 of them need to come from 37 different counties.\n\n\nTL;DR - A lot of red tape.\n\nEdit: Formatting (not a big poster on Reddit, just a lurker).", "aSentId": 20692, "answer": "holly wall of text...", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l", "qSentId": 20696, "question": "I love how it's always \"activist judges\" when conservatives don't get the ruling they want.

Depending on the answer to question #1, the government must have an increasingly good reason to violate the right.  The most fundamental rights come under what's called *strict scrutiny*, and the government must have an overwhelmingly good reason if it wants to violate them.  This is reserved for questions of racial discrimination, government suppression of a dissenting viewpoint, etc.  The least fundamental rights come under *rational basis* review.  These are things like your right to drive on a public road and such.  The government needs a *rational* reason to deprive you of this right.  It doesn't even have to be a good reason - it just has to *make sense*.  In between, moderately fundamental rights fall under *intermediate scrutiny* and require a good reason.\n\nQuestion #1 for gay marriage is whether to decide it under rational basis or intermediate scrutiny.  This is an incredibly important question.  Bans on gay marriage fail, without question, under intermediate scrutiny.  There is no *good* reason to ban gay marriage.  This is why there's so much pushback from conservatives on whether or not being gay is a choice.  If being gay is a choice or a \"lifestyle\", then it's not really something fundamental.  So cases would fall under rational basis.  If being gay is not a choice, but something innate, cases must be decided on intermediate scrutiny.\n\nSo **if** being gay is a choice, the case goes to rational basis.  A gay couple is being denied the right to marry whomever they choose, but they still have the right to marry, because, you know, they can marry someone of the opposite sex just fine.  This brings up question #2: does such a ban have a *rational basis*?  Is there an actual reason for such a ban, or is it simply an arbitrary decision?  Religious reasons don't count - they would fall under \"arbitrary\".  That's why conservatives pull out arguments like \"tradition\" and \"ability to bear children.\"  They know that they're *bad* arguments, but the arguments don't have to be good.  They just have to be *rational*.  If the judge deems them rational, the law passes question #2, and is ruled constitutional.\n\nSo, in summary, the twofold argument of the people trying to uphold these bans is that A) people are *choosing* to want a gay marriage and B) the state has a *rational* reason to deny them such a marriage.  If either of these points fails, the law is unconstitutional.\n\nMany courts are overturning on the basis of point A.  They believe that sexual orientation is an inherent characteristic of a person.  This necessitates intermediate scrutiny, and so they overturn the ban.  A few have conceded point A, that being gay may be a choice.

Thank you.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l", "qSentId": 20763, "question": "OK, here's the argument.\n\nConstitutionality comes down to two questions: 1) how fundamental is the right being infringed, and 2) does the government have a good enough reason to violate that right?\n\nThere are three levels of \"fundamental\".  Depending on the answer to question #1, the government must have an increasingly good reason to violate the right.  The most fundamental rights come under what's called *strict scrutiny*, and the government must have an overwhelmingly good reason if it wants to violate them.  This is reserved for questions of racial discrimination, government suppression of a dissenting viewpoint, etc.  The least fundamental rights come under *rational basis* review.  These are things like your right to drive on a public road and such.  The government needs a *rational* reason to deprive you of this right.  It doesn't even have to be a good reason - it just has to *make sense*.  In between, moderately fundamental rights fall under *intermediate scrutiny* and require a good reason.\n\nQuestion #1 for gay marriage is whether to decide it under rational basis or intermediate scrutiny.  This is an incredibly important question.  Bans on gay marriage fail, without question, under intermediate scrutiny.  There is no *good* reason to ban gay marriage.  This is why there's so much pushback from conservatives on whether or not being gay is a choice.  If being gay is a choice or a \"lifestyle\", then it's not really something fundamental.  So cases would fall under rational basis.  If being gay is not a choice, but something innate, cases must be decided on intermediate scrutiny.\n\nSo **if** being gay is a choice, the case goes to rational basis.  A gay couple is being denied the right to marry whomever they choose, but they still have the right to marry, because, you know, they can marry someone of the opposite sex just fine.  This brings up question #2: does such a ban have a *rational basis*?  Is there an actual reason for such a ban, or is it simply an arbitrary decision?  Religious reasons don't count - they would fall under \"arbitrary\".  That's why conservatives pull out arguments like \"tradition\" and \"ability to bear children.\"  They know that they're *bad* arguments, but the arguments don't have to be good.  They just have to be *rational*.  If the judge deems them rational, the law passes question #2, and is ruled constitutional.\n\nSo, in summary, the twofold argument of the people trying to uphold these bans is that A) people are *choosing* to want a gay marriage and B) the state has a *rational* reason to deny them such a marriage.  If either of these points fails, the law is unconstitutional.\n\nMany courts are overturning on the basis of point A.  They believe that sexual orientation is an inherent characteristic of a person.  This necessitates intermediate scrutiny, and so they overturn the ban.  A few have conceded point A, that being gay may be a choice.

That's up to the judge.  \n\nFor example, the judge who overturned the Texas ban on gay marriage said that the state had \"failed to identify any rational, much less a compelling, reason that is served by denying same-sex couples the fundamental right to marry\".  He certainly thought the reasons weren't rational.  (It should also be noted that he required Texas to meet strict scrutiny in this case.  But he said that even had he only required rational basis, he would have still overturned it.)\n\nMeanwhile, the judge in Louisiana thought the opposite.  In his words, \"The Court is persuaded that a meaning of what is marriage that has endured in history for thousands of years, and prevails in a majority of states today, is not universally irrational on the constitutional grid.\"  So he upheld Louisiana's ban.\n\nIt's important to state just how lenient rational basis review is.  The rational basis doesn't have to actually further a state's interest currently.  It just has to hypothetically further a state's interest in a situation that *might* occur.  If the state's lawyers can't think of a rational reason, judges are even encouraged to think of one themselves to save the law.\n\nSo to overturn a law that's receiving only rational basis review, \"this doesn't actually further a state's interests\" wouldn't work.
