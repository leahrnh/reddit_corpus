","aSentId": 36934,"answer": "As I understand it, all manufacturers generally make relatively frequent updates to their products; the joke stems from how certain Apple products aren't designed to be upgradable by the end-user. This shortens the period of time during which the device can be kept operating smoothly and/or with reasonable utility alongside the constantly increasing demands on processing power by newer software, and the rate at which newer high quality formats demand more out of memory capacity. Then, to keep up with the tide, the user is forced to purchase an entirely new device instead of being able to keep their old one and spend considerably less on upgrading it. e.g. MacBooks with RAM soldered on the board, no SD card slot on iPhones.\n\nTo be fair, however, other companies have also started to shift in that direction (one reason why out of many is because of the demand for thinner products). An example in laptops would be a few of the thinner Ultrabooks on the market that also have soldered RAM, and on the side of phones would be the Moto X, which also lacks an SD card slot.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qgzt","qSentId": 36933,"question": "This comment confuses me.  \n\nIs Apple the only company that updates it's products every year with a newer and slightly better one.

I'm a Mac, Windows, and Linux user and also an Android, iOS, former Blackberry, former Symbian, etc. etc. user.\n\nAs far as Apple's prices, it depends on what your requirements are and what you find *value* in. Its the same thing from clothes to restaurants to watches to cars. Some people find the premium for OSX/Mac hardware worth it while others don't. Doesn't mean that Apple computers suck. Also if you do a cost comparison between Apple and *similar class* non-Apple hardware now you won't find a HUGE difference in price. And, if you want to run OS X on your non-Apple hardware, you probably won't get as smooth an experience as if you just had bought a Mac in the first place (not to mention, it is technically illegal). \n\nAs far as product lockdown, OS X is pretty open (you can install a package manager like brew and have a similar experience to any other UNIX-like OS) but beyond that, yes Apple products are being designed to be more restrictive of what people can do. Still that doesn't mean Apple sucks. This goes back to your requirements for a device and what you find *value* in. I have an Android phone that doesn't have a user replaceable battery or an SD card and it has a locked boot loader (which I haven't bothered unlocking), but I still think it's the best damn phone I've ever used (better than my iPhone 6). If you can live with these restrictions, then maybe Apple is for you - if not, then move along. \n\nBTW jumping back to prices, I'm on T-Mobile where you basically pay the full price of a phone in monthly installments. If you compare high end Android devices to iPhones, you'll find the costs to be relatively on par. \n\nApple may not innovate in the way you think of companies like Tesla coming up with new tech. Compare the original iPod to early MP3 players (I had a Creative Labs Nomad) and you'll see what Apple got right was the usability/user experience. Look at pretty much all of their products and you'll find that this is what Apple is about. Taking technology that other people are making, and then making a more user friendly version. I mean, if you look up the word *innovate* in a dictionary, one of the definitions is \n\n&gt; Make changes in something established, especially by introducing new methods, ideas, or products.\n\nwhich is pretty much what Apple's MO is. Some of the way they market their products tries to \"spin\" things as only ever being done by Apple, but I think all marketing speak is pretty much BS. \n\nTL;DR - Apple makes computers and other devices that some people like and other people don't.

","aSentId": 37288,"answer": "No, actually I'm not. If you actually compare 1:1 specs and not \"this is basically as good as\" compromises, the prices are almost identical between HP, Dell and Apple. You are free to do so. Dell and HP sell extremely good computers that are high end and uncompromising, they *also* sell extremely cheap computers that 'on paper' look comparable but if you actually dig into the specs and overall assembly they are, without fail, compromised(things like using Intel 47xxu vs. 49xxhq and claiming it is the same). The misrepresentation of Apple's pricing starts at misunderstanding the markets they are actually competing in. Of their direct competitors they're barely 'overpriced' at all to where it is a question of value more than MSRP. Of course if all you care about are parts-in-a-box PC running Windows 7 to play games, Apple is a pathetic choice for that, but that's one segment out of a wide world.\n\nMac OS X is not restricted or 'locked down' any more than any other operating system and it has a wide range of standards sport and compatibility. iOS 'lock in' is overstated and decreasing with every major update(as evidenced by recently added extensions and Apple's increasingly lax policies on what they're allowing on the App Store), and it's also not *user facing* for the most part. The average user is barely affected by it at all. Some Apple hardware is 'locked' in terms of being sealed designs, but this is not unique to Apple either as increasingly more companies are moving to this for their thinnest and lightest machines as a compromise to getting them there. It's still a preference either way, not an intrinsically horrible thing to live with. In case you haven't noticed, computers have gotten to be so powerful that the need for tinkering with components has been pushed into a niche. \n\nLastly, and again innovation is not invention. Apple is not always *the first* to do something and they don't always *create* it, but they have a long track record of doing it *right*, where 'right' is defined by \"Sets the industry standard\". From the GUI and Mouse to the iMac to the Titanium Powerbook to the iPod and iPhone and iPad If you seriously think Apple hasn't influenced all of these markets significantly because of their approach, there's nothing really to say other than you're blotting out reality. It doesn't mean Apple is the only company to do it, just about every company has contributed innovation and invention to the overall state of computing to varying degrees, but not every company shifts the entire market the way Apple does. Apple *does* overstate their role as well, but trying to pretend like they haven't made serious contributions to the state of consumer technology and computers is a ridiculous stance to take. It's not a zero-sum game. You can hate Apple all you want, but that doesn't take away from their track record.\n\nAnd for the record, there are plenty of things I really hate about Apple myself. Their software has gotten progressively worse in recent years, they keep trying to reinvent the wheel in some areas when it is hugely unnecessary to do so, they have an awful tendency to dumb things down beyond sense and nearly everything they make has gotten cheaper in some respects in terms of build quality, they have good 'on paper' support for older products but in real world usage they don't give a shit, just to list a few. But they still do a lot of things really well and more to the point the specific three points dude was talking about are misrepresentations and inaccuracies.

I can't even fathom what $18 Billion looks like. But I mean, sure, electric cars aren't a new thing, but no one has ever attempted to mass produce them and really try to make them a \"thing\" until Tesla came along. And that's exactly why it's an $100,000 car. Expensive for most people, but they cannot even keep up with the orders they have. Your average joe wants a Tesla, and that's exactly what'll happen with driverless electric cars. You have to remember that iPhones and high-end electric cars serve the same purpose: they're status symbols. Having the iPhone 6 Plus in Gold the first day it comes out and driving around in a Tesla P85D says a lot more than just \"I have a phone and an electric car\". It says \"I'm wealthy enough to afford these luxury items, I also probably have a nice a house and I'm financially stable, AND I care about the enviroment. Let's not forget how successful I probably am\". People care about how other people see them, and if buying the Gold iPhone 6 makes them look better around strangers, they'll buy it. This is also exactly why Apple took of 50% of the market share for smartphones last year and not whoever made the OnePlus. My point is, the first color televisions sold for $1,000+, and now look where we are. The same will happen with driverless cars and presumably Apple's version of them.

They got attention, but like you pointed out they were stylus based and let's not forget clunky. The UI was ugly and nobody lined up outside of any store to get their hands on one. If touchscreen was a craze, Apple would not have had a hard time looking for a carrier to support the iPhone in order to sell to consumers. Hell, if it was a craze every carrier would have wanted the iPhone. But nobody did, it had no potential in the market because touchscreens phones were inferior to the Blackberry which was selling thousands of phones and was for some time a \"craze\". Then the iPhone comes out and bam...everyone wants one. It looked modern and not like anything that was available in the market in their eyes. Touchscreen was their unique selling point, but that's not why people wanted one. It looked high-quality, modern, and more importantly, it made whoever had one seem different and the demand for one meant that if you had one you were hip. 90% of people care about that, not specs. Your average consumer has no idea what RAM or PPI is or why it's important. That's why Apple sold almost 50% of smartphones in Q4 and not any Android-based smartphone company with way better specs. The harsh reality is that the majority of people do not care about specs, they care about design and decent functionailty. If it were the other way around, the Pebble Steel would be out of stock and people would desperately try to get their hands on it. But let's be honest, the thing is hideous. Do you know what smartwatch people will camp out for? You guessed it, the god damn iWatch. You may dislike the iPhone 6, but 20 million of them were still sold in only 2 weeks. You are literally one in a million. The thing about Android is that it has way too many features that your average consumer does not need, which is why every time Apple copies a feature and implements it into iOS it becomes \"new\" and \"innovative\". iOS is an app launcher that works well, looks good, and does what the average person wants. That's why people who get an iPhone end up keeping it once they forget the aesthetic aspect that initially got them to buy it over a Nexus. You cannot recognize Apples' design capability and focus and say you have not benefitted from them forcing other companies to put more focus on aesthetics. Apple will do the same to driverless cars, and this is how a company who cares about specs and functionaility will fuse the two with beautiful design to try to one-up Apple and in the end, you will get the best of both worlds. A perfect example of this is Tesla, and companies like them will inevitable emerge. You will benefit as a consumer in the end.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qgzt","qSentId": 37465,"question": "ITT: Just bad Apple jokes.","aSentId": 37466,"answer": "/r/gadgets has repeatedly surprised me with the depths it will sink to for a cheap rehashed joke made at Apple by people who have never used their products and have no idea what they do.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qgzt","qSentId": 37467,"question": "/r/gadgets has repeatedly surprised me with the depths it will sink to for a cheap rehashed joke made at Apple by people who have never used their products and have no idea what they do.","aSentId": 37468,"answer": "Just out of curiosity, how do you know these people have never used Apple's products? \n\nYeah, there could be more discussion of the post's actual content, but none of these mildly irritated, \"Stop making Apple jokes.\" posts accomplish that either.

Many of the features that were originally promised (Iphone connectivity, Heart Rate Monitor, google play (on release you needed to jail break it to access the store), waterproofing, nfc) were scrapped by the time the actual watch arrived over a year behind schedule.  The screen on the watch looks like something from a toy, the image is really grainy and the display is unresponsive most of the time; nothing like the working prototype.  It feels like after they got the money they found the cheapest shittiest parts they could find and threw together the product they ended up shipping out.  \n\nIt's supposed to be a stand alone device for making calls but I tried it as just a watch (with wifi, bluetooth turned off) and the thing can't even make it through a full day before the battery dies.  I think I got almost 12 hours of it being a watch.  This is with it only turning on when I checked the time.  \n\nThe customer service was awful and at one point they let a kickstarter backer who they gave an early watch to start responding to customer service inquiries.  They over promised and under delivered, which will probably be the case with this thing too.  Hence why they want you to pay the $500 up front to get the watch for a $300 discount.

It doesn't have its unique feature now. iOS with its 'You see it here first\" apps, Android with its complete ability for total customization, Windows with its super cross platform interface, Nokia with its super-awesome cameras, Ubuntu with its ... price?
