We've had a handful of Superman movies, a plethora of Batman movies. We've been there, done that. A solo movie would not generate nearly as much interest as a team up/versus movie. This is Batman and Superman starring in the same movie for the first time ever! Arguably the two most well known super heroes of all time. From the perspective of a movie goer and of DC as a  company, a versus movie is a fantastic idea.\n\nI also don't think they'll include Doomsday (he's a pretty boring villain anyway) but I am curious what the common enemy is going to be. Lex is the most obvious choice because we know he's in the movie, but even in his battlesuit I don't quite understand how that requires Batman and Superman to team up. \n\nIf they go the battlesuit route, it could be that Batman's suit and Lex's suit share the same foundation. This could cripple Batman's suit against Lex, meaning he has to lose the mech suit and fight as regular Bats. At the same time, the suit could have some effect on Superman, just as Batman's suit appears to have some effect on him. This would mean that neither of them could take him on solo, but together...maybe they stand a chance.\n\nThis ties in to another wild theory I have (and I really don't think this is the case, I'm just speculating for fun) that the voice we hear saying \"Tell me do you bleed?\" comes not from Batman but from Lex in his suit. The reason for the voice mainly because Jesse Eisenberg's regular voice would sound a bit funny and unintimidating coming from a huge mech. That's off course a long shot.\n\nAt any rate, the movie still has a lot of surprises for us and that excites me more than anything. Unless the trailers get carried away and let something slip (which they probably will) I could go into this movie not knowing what to expect.

I would have rather seen a movie where they meet and perhaps they clash in the very beginning with a small fight but the core of the movie would be an older more experienced Batman mentoring the young newbie to the superhero scene.  A \"You can't allow for such destruction and let so many civillians die during your battles, Clark.\" kind of education for Superman.  Centering the entire premise of the movie around a fight that we know will end in a draw removes all drama from the battle.  Though, now that I think about it, in superhero movies the outcome is rarely in question so that shouldn't be much of an issue.

The themes in Jurassic Park are what make it a great story.\n\nIt was about humankind's perversion of science to make money.  Obviously, this theme has been present in each film of the franchise, with Ingen being the big, bad corporate entity.\n \nThe first movie dealt with Hammond's delusions.  One example of this is his conversation about the flea circus.  He is unable to see that JP is an illusion.  Another example is his repeated insistence that they \"spared no expense\" in the making of Jurassic Park.  The whole reason Nedry fucked everyone over was because the IT department was so understaffed and underpaid.\n    \nIt was about how \"life finds a way.\"  In the park, the dinos find a way to escape the confines of the park.  They also find a way for two female dinos to reproduce.  The instincts to reproduce find a way in Dr. Grant.  Grant's character begins the movie scaring the shit out of a snot-nosed kid at a dig site, and he basically claims to hate kids.  A related note - he also finds a way to fasten his seatbelt in the helicopter by making two female ends work, which is exactly what the dinos did...make two female ends work.\n\nTo me, the Jurassic Park franchise is sadly just like the Godzilla franchise.  Gojira was released not long after nuclear bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Gojira was about creating a weapon so terrible that it should never be used.

The all too familiar noise of chewing, which echoed throughout the home. It did not take long for one to recognize this as the horrible, magnificent beast that was /u/RLLRR. The potato chips rustled uneasily, the ice cream shivered in fear and the bacon was ready to shriek its swan son of terror. Surprisingly, the vegetables were not afraid. They all simply glanced over without a care. As if they already knew their fate...\n\nHowever, all the other foods were living in horrible uncertainty. The biggest question: When?... When will this beautiful and sublime beast choose to end their lives? When will it all be over? When would the delivery boy show up and ring the front door?\n\n**Ding-Dong**\n\nAt last, *salvation*.\n\n*Boom, boom. Boom, boom.*\n\nLike thunder rolling across the living room, the /u/RLLRR slowly lumbered towards the front door. One would not think it was a graceful creature, but DO NOT be fooled. It preserves its energy, waiting for the moment to unleash to unspeakable rampage upon innocent food stuffs.\n\n*creeeak*\n\n\"Hey, man. I got your pizza here. Large stuffed crust with sausage and pepperoni.\"\n\n**Brraaaawr**\n\n\"Yeah, I also have that order in this other case here. Your total will be 28.75$\"\n\n**Grrrr. Rawwr**\n\n\"Alright. Well take care sir. Have a good night.\"\n\n*No tip? Fucking cheapskate*\n\n**SLAM**\n\nNow that the /u/RLLRR completed its tiresome act of hunting for food, it could now continue feasting. As it made its way towards the dining room, a group of strangers had now begun tracking the vile and amazing hunter. Slowly and stealthily, they followed a few steps behind, in the shadow of the colossus. The giant hovered its prize over the kitchen table, already bearing the carcass of the previous victim, a double cheeseburger with special sauce and waffle fries. Red splotches and smears decorated the paper coverings. A blood bath of ketchup if there ever was one.\n\nNow, RLLRR meant to repeat the same massacre, but on a much grander scale. As the cardboard box was lifted, the pungent smell of oven baked pizza quickly filled the room. Cheese melted in place, inviting anyone to come dance a passionate tango with anyone that met its gaze. Sausage and bacon wrestled with one another for dominance. They were blissfully unaware as to the ungodly sight they would behold in a few moments.\n\n**Grawww! Shreeeee!**\n\nNow it was time. **Feeding time.**\n\nEvery part of that pizza soon realized what was happening, but all far too late. The abomination of god now was the time for no quarter. The pizza froze up in fear, like veal in the headlights. And to make matters worse, it displayed the only survival technique that food knew: It played dead. How awful it was that it would soon meet its demise...\n\nBut what is this? The strange and dark figures from earlier now approach. And now they are much easier to distinguish in the ceiling light. They were a pack of cold Bud Light. Many people would scoff at the same group of beers, never even think to give them a second glance. But such people would not know the true stopping power of these brews. And for pizza, she was out of options.\n\nShe cried out in dismay. \"Help!\" However, the cold killers already jumped into action. Like ninjas in the mist they surrounded and overwhelmed the /u/RLLRR. A few strikes here, a couple jabs there. Like synchronized killing, they never relented and maintained pressure. Now pizza was cheering, greasy tears streaming down her crust. \"Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!\"\n\n**Aroooooooo!**\n\nThe beast stumbled backwards. It retreated to the living room couch. With its final death wail, it collapsed in a heap and passed out for the rest of the night. Bud Light had won that day,  it not without losing a few of its brethren.  But now the beast was beaten, if only for one day.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3s", "qSentId": 4455, "question": "That's how a simple beer can take me down.

It's almost impossible to create a sequel that will fit all the fans' wants and will be perfectly accurate with the original movie and modern science.\n\nBut there are three things I don't like about this trailer:\n\n *  I-Rex shouldn't have been completely revealed this early; they should have hid it like they have done with T-Rex (BTW, is that T-Rex at 0:38 ?)\n *  The CGI is not bad, but for a movie as big as this, I think there should be much more improvement.

The discordant harmonies paired with beautiful, yet unsettling images, is a great way to communicate emotional tension without dialogue. \n\n&gt;None of this really pertains to the rest of the movie except that it sort of sets the mood. \n\nSee, I felt that the prelude to the film essentially tells you the ending. *Melancholia* is about depression, ultimately. I thought the ominous foreshadowing of Earth's destruction was a beautiful way to bookend the cyclical nature of the depressive state. You know you're going to be in pain, so you live in that pain and, ultimately, end up in pain, exactly where you thought you'd be.\n\n&gt;The location is beautiful too, except it too is nonsensical. What astronomer lives in an impeccable remote castle? \n\nNo doubt, this is a bit of a stretch. But clearly this is the result of family money, not Keifer's own.... One of the questions the film seems to be raising is the way that wealth and happiness work together (obviously, this is not nearly a main theme of the film). So, I'm willing to let this slide.\n\n&gt;The most beautiful, but least purposeful, shot is when the protagonist, a depressed woman, decides to run off into the woods and pose naked in the forest for no good reason.\n\nI don't think it's for no good reason. I realize that there isn't a very good realistic reason for her to do this. Though, if we're honest, Justine has quite left the realm of reason here. Which, I think, is partially the point. Melancholia becomes an external manifestation of Justine's depressive trauma. Thus, she offers up her naked body as a sacrifice, in a way, to Melancholia. There's some imagery in her nudity here. She's stripped away the signs of wealth, she's left society and gone to the woods. When it is just her and the universe, she must embrace the absurdity of it all and give herself over to it. That is one of the only moments in the film where Justine seems free. \n\nMelancholia is one of my favorite films.

It's a colossal failure in urban planning, and that's the problem I have with it.\n\nIf we eliminated the highway system in, for instance the most car-centric place I can think of that I've visited, the Bay Area in California, what'd happen is people would move to within walking distance of Caltrain or BART, businesses would spring up around where people are, and somewhere like Mountain View (halfway between SF and SJ) would become a pleasant, walkable little neighborhood. Former suburbs after having been vacating would return to being farmland and food security would increase.

Marvel and Disney are not the only game in town anymore looking for expanded or shared universes. DC, Universal, MGM, Fox, Lionsgate, Paramount, and just about everyone else in town is about to jump into the game in the next five years. The next Avengers cycle is going to start up into phase 3, meaning all the actors that the people cared about will most likely be swapped out for a new set of heroes who will probably not carry the mantle well enough to get in the average joes. \n\nI'm not talking about the/r/movies readership, who tend to champion these films and has never met one it doesn't like, but the general populace who goes to these films. The medium is just going too be bloated in terms of cash flow that the studios throw at these films to let a studio take a risk such as letting a director or writer have more creative leeway over the producers of the film. Kevin Feige said as much in his extensive Business Week profile stating they have ways of changing the film to meet their formula. Will Marvel deviate from it? Probably not because its worked for them so far. The ultimate point being that the big studio system is essentially making themselves the primary second market by providing these films at a faster pace and making them more a priority. Flooding the market at the pace planned in the next five years, including movies that aren't superhero franchises, but other properties of similar merit, will be untenable with such high stakes budgets in play. Not all these threads are going to make it through the needle hole. \n\nA female led superhero movie would be welcome, but ultimately the formula and set up of the stories superhero movies tell will not change. And I don't think Marvel is going to be able to carry over another huge investment in a Phase 4,5 and 6 cycle when the cinemaplex will be saturated with their own studio franchises, as well as others, attempting to do the same. \n\nEDIT: I would like to add that Marvel does not own all its properties and as a result the ones it sold off to studios will be made with varying degrees of quality and will have Marvel's name on it. They can assume that Thor, Captain America, Hulk and Iron Man are part of the same universe, but what of Spider-Man's two tepidly received films? What of The Incredible Hulk that failed to set the world aflame?

They have to play broad and appeal to the most people possible, and anything too different is going feared by film studios.\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy is probably the best example of this. It's not really an experimentation, mostly taking elements of a space opera and fusing it together with a superhero movie, but it's different enough to stand out and feel like a breath of fresh air (it helps that it doesn't feel like a piece of a jigsaw puzzle). Winter Soldier, to a lesser extent, does this with spy tropes. But it's the same stuff, you're just making different kinds of cheese.\n\nPeople often don't know what they want until they see it. If any experimentation is going to happen, it's going to come from a studio who is trying to get a leg-up on Marvel, which is why I'm so interested to see how Fox and WB are handling their stuff (superhero experimentation is only going to come from big studios, sadly). On that front, I think it looks *kinda* promising. Deadpool, for example, is a character that can be used to riff on superhero tropes in a hard r action comedy shell. Suicide Squad seems to be a good vehicle for David Ayer to explore the line between a hero and villain, which is an idea he seems to like playing with. Batman v Superman at least looks like it wants to explore the toll having a super person on Earth takes on humanity. Will any of them do any of that effectively?
