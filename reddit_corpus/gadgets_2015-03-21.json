It's got the same processor, RAM, and screen resolution as the Nexus 6, but it's got a much better battery (than any other phone out there right now, not just the Nexus), and it's a little smaller at 5.1\" where the Nexus 6 is 6\" (which is pretty big, in my opinion; if you do choose the Nexus 6 or the Note 4, make sure you go to a store beforehand and hold one, so you can make sure it's comfortable for you to hold).\n\nHowever, both the Droid Turbo and the Nexus 6 lack expandable memory.

Between the Note 4 and the Droid Turbo, I'd say that you should pick between which feature is most important to you: battery life or expandable storage.\n\nOn a separate note, I feel like I should warn you about this. Smartphones have changed a lot and evolved since the iPhone 4S came out; nowadays, most phones are made to last you less than 5 years, whether they're Androids or iPhones. Any phone will likely stop receiving official software updates after about 3 years, and the hardware will usually start to deteriorate after 2-3 years, running slower and slower. Most phone manufacturers now put out a new device every year, so that when you feel your device is getting slower or outdated (which usually starts happening around the 1.5-2 year mark), you'll go out and get a new phone with a new multi-year plan. No matter how top-of-the-line your device is when you get it, there'll always be something better coming out just around the corner.

The generally accepted limits of human hearing are 20 Hz on the low end and 20 kHz on the high end, so the bandwidth would be 19.98 kHz. But these are not precise numbers, they're rounded (I'm not sure if the upper figure has one or two digits of precision, but I would be very surprised to discover that it has three, and I'm fairly sure that 20 Hz is only one digit of precision), so to say 19.98 kHz implies excessive precision.  It's like the joke about the janitor in a museum who says that the T-rex skeleton is 65 million and seven years old, because it was 65 million years old when he started working there seven years ago. I'd rather call the bandwidth 20 kHz. \n\nOn a side note, a lot of people aren't able to hear up to 20 kHz, since high frequencies are the first to go (with age or exposure to loud sound), and some young people can hear a bit above 20 kHz, but 20 kHz is the usually cited figure.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qgzt", "qSentId": 23580, "question": "Well, good luck on making aiwa successful again.

So is knowledge of the coreutils, gcc, vi, and so on.\n\nI also think that Linux rewards experimentation and computer knowledge more than Windows. On Linux, someone who likes and studies computers can change practically anything. Someone can change their window manager, for example, which I am not sure is possible on Windows. That freedom is rewarding and I think it encourages learning. Giving a child a Raspberry Pi and encouraging them to modify it as they see fit would be a great learning experience, and not really possible on Windows with the restrictive licenses and more limited tools. When my daughter got her first computer she installed a different distro every week before settling on Mint, which is the kind of experience you couldn't possibly get on Windows. She was thrilled with the idea that she could make her computer do whatever she wanted. I had to bail her out whenever she broke something (which happened frequently), but she learned and had fun doing it. Compare that to most children who don't realize that it's possible to put something other than Windows on a non-Apple PC or OS X on a Mac.\n\nSo the point is not that children can learn programming.

It usually means that the TV is trying to do something predictive or reactive based on the input to the screen. While if you're using it as a monitor you want to have it display exactly what your PC is sending over the wire, not alter it in any way. If you can turn it off, then it's probably OK, but the cheaper TVs won't include the feature, so you can save money that way. (In particular avoid dynamic up-scaling. This will cause you grief when you play a full screen game that causes the resolution to change.)\n\nDon't get anything that's interlaced. 1080i is interlaced, you want 1080p. (Progressive.) Don't get anything less than 1080p (which is 1920x1080) don't get anything that says \"extra wide format\" or something like that, because they will stretch the image on cheaper TVs. (Though some more expensive ones will have a wider number of pixels than 1920 and allow for a true wide format.) For most people 60 hertz is an OK refresh rate. If you play video games then 60 hertz is probably the lowest refresh rate that you want since if you play FPS the higher the refresh rate the better you will perform in game. If you're a hardcore FPS gamer, look for a 120 hertz refresh rate or higher.\n\nI've found that when there's an advertised special they will sell a cheap TV with lots of features, but they will be out of stock when you get there. They will try to drive you towards a more expensive one, but they usually also have a pile of TVs that are only a little more expensive than the one on special, but they are stripped of features. Those are the ones you want, as long as they are 1080p.\n\nThe only real down side to these TVs is that they rarely include external switches, so you always need to keep the remote nearby to turn it on, and it usually takes 5 to 15 seconds for them to warm up and turn on after you push the power button. So you need to watch for the power indicator LED and wait for it to turn on.\n\nThe up side is that you get built in speakers (which are usually not too great, but for most people, OK) and you can flip over to watch digital TV without needing an adapter. Also you can get a much bigger screen for way less money than a monitor. (Think about how far away from the TV you will sit. Simulate that by facing the screen in the store from the same distance. If you can't see both sides on the monitor without turning your head. (i.e. just moving your eyes a little) then it's too big to use as a monitor. Unless you're getting 4K, then you can open a window only in part of the screen and look just at that while the rest of the screen shows your desktop or other apps.)\n\nMonitors tend to have better power management features and work with your computer to turn off the screen when the input goes dormant. While TVs will display a blue screen for hours until they turn off. Actual monitors will also turn on way faster, react faster to resolution changes, and you can get higher resolutions in general.  However, at least for me as I'm old and decrepit 1080p is good enough, and maybe some day I'll get 4K, but I have to move close to the monitor and squint to see individual pixels at 1080p. There's a world of difference between the 1024x768 19 inch CRT I had in 2002 and the 32 inch 1920x1080 TV I got in 2010.

Those usually use a Mediatek SoC and come with WiFi, Bluetooth connectivity and a USB host port.  \n  \nSince Intel makes mobile x86 and x64 SoCs (used in tablets, phones and the new macbook) I assume it will use a similar SoC. It will be able to run 'full' x86 (maybe also x64) programs because it also runs a x86 (or x64) version of Windows, not the less capable Windows RT for ARM.  \nBut those Intel SoC are low power and low performance. Coupled with only 1-2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage and a mobile GPU, you don't want to use heavy programs, like Photoshop, video editing tools, 3D tools (CAD, 3D modelling) or a big IDE (eclipse or so). They might run, but performance will be bad.  \n  \nThose devices are suitable for web browsing, some office stuff and light programs. I think you could do some simple programming on them (Javascript and html), maybe even some simple graphic editing/design. They might be able to run lighter games (2D games or old 3D games), but nothing new and fancy. There are capable emulators (SNES, N64, PS1, PS2...) for Android (and mobile SoC), so those devices might be powerful enough to run an emulator for an older gaming console.  \n  \nI think those devices are useful either as some kind of smart TV device or when, for example, visiting your parents and you know you have work to do on a computer, but you don't need to bring a laptop and you don't want/can use your parent's computer for it.
