If your electrical panel can have circuit breakers and GFCIs to protect things in your home from short circuiting and blowing up, there's no reason why the electrical company is going to let their transformers blow up. The only time transformers blow up is when they're defective to begin with.

Growing up in Minnesota, the storm front that moved through here yesterday looks a LOT like many of the front's I've seen move through the north that produced weak tornadoes, so I was relating a personal pattern to what I'm seeing. In fact where I grew up it was more common to have severe straight-line winds 80-120 MPH than it was to have a tornado of any significance... Which from my *personal experience* is the exact opposite of where I live in Oklahoma.
