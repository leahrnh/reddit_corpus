Naturally this two page article is very bare bones, but it gives a good general idea.\n\nThere are some inaccuracies and things left out of the article. Mainly:\n\n- There is no mention of the SS training he recieved in 1941.\nDuring the early 1941, SS-Standartenf\u00fchrer Dahm came to Finland to recruit volunteers to serve in the Waffen-SS. Working together with the Secret Polive of Finland they recruited some 1200 hundred volunteers out of some 1900 applicants. From July 6th 1941 onwards T\u00f6rni served in the Waffen-SS. He returned to Finland on the 30th of July. Just in time for the attack against the Soviet Union.\n\n- Between the summer of 1941 and early 1943 T\u00f6rni served in a multitude of roles. During the attack phase he commanded a tank platoon in Kev. Os. 8 (Light Detachtment 8). In January 1942 he moved to JR 56 (Infantry Regiment 56) as a infantry platoon leader. There he took part in many patrols into the enemy territory. \n\n- He was wounded once during WW2. \n23rd of March 1942 he skied into a mine. He recieved shrapnel injuries on different parts of his body and was partly paralyzed.\n\n- He recieved his famed company in 1943.\nIn January 1943 two ranger companies were founded in 1st Division. T\u00f6rni was ordered to command the 2nd Company. He was very meticulous in training his men. In the words of one of T\u00f6rni's company veterans (these words come from my memory, since I don't have the source material ready at hand):\n\"In the morning we put on packbacks filled with bricks. We put down these packbacks only at lunch and in the afternoon when training for the day was over.\"\n\n- A future Finninsh President Mauno Koivisto served in T\u00f6rni's company.\n\n- Finland did not surrender in 1944.\nA cease-fire was called on the 4th-5th of September 1944. The Moscow Armistice between Soviet Union, UK and Finland. This is what ended the Continuation War. Not surrender (and yes I'm butthurt).\n\n- T\u00f6rni took part in the Weapons Cache Case.\nDuring the demobilization of the Finnish army following the Moscow Armistice large quantities of weapons and supplies were hidden. It was believed that a Soviet occupation of Finland was imminent and these weapons were to be used guearilla war. Early 1945 the caches were revealed and it was only then when T\u00f6rni went back to Germany.\n\nObviously there are a whole bunch of other stuff left out and for good reason.
