", "aSentId": 732, "answer": "Millar gets way too much hate, and saying he randomly throws rape into all of his books is a huge over generalization.\n\nHis DC work is insanely strong across the board, with critically hailed runs on *The Authority*, *Swamp Thing*, and *Superman: Red Son*, which is still considered one of the best Superman stories to this day.\n\nThen you have his Marvel work, which is a step up from his previously really strong work.  Other then Bendis on Spider-Man, Millar pretty much single handedly crafted the early days of the Ultimate U, with much loved runs on *Ultimate X-Men*, *Ultimate F4*, and of course his run on *The Ultimates* with Bryan Hitch.  His Ultimates run by the way, is entirely what brought The Avengers back into the spotlight after years of ambiguity.  It was when Millar left and Jeph Loeb took his place that the Ultimate U totally went to hell.  \n\nAnd that's not even the end of his Marvel work.  He's got *Old Man Logan* under his belt, the highly underrated *Marvel Knights: Spider-Man*, which forever changed the status quo of one of Spidey's biggest villains, and he wrote one of the biggest events Marvel has ever had to this day in *Civil War*.  Everyone also seems to forget that he's the guy who created the *Marvel zombies* as well.  \n\nEven his creator owned work, which is what everyone likes to focus on when bashing him, has plenty of great pieces, particularly his later stuff.  Starlight, Jupiter's Legacy, MPH, The Secret Service, Superior, Supercrooks.  The guy is a really talented writer.  \n\nSure, he wrote *Trouble*.  Sure, *Nemesis* was overly violent and edgy.  Same with his *Kick Ass* stuff, *Wanted*, *The (painfully unfunny) Unfunnies*, and a few other works he's done.  Sure, every now and then it seeps in a little with some of his earlier work.  But to say he is bad at writing all kinds of stories is just false, and it's dumb to judge him by his worst work like so many do.  Alan Moore's not a bad writer because he wrote *Neonomicon*.  Matt Fraction's not a bad writer because of his *Fantastic Four* run or *Fear Itself*.  Jonathan Hickman's not a bad writer because of *God is Dead* or *Red Mass For Mars*.  And Mark Millar isn't a bad writer because he wrote some too edgy books back in the day, something that he has completely stopped in the last couple of years.
