Let's run through a simple hypothetical scenario, and see whether you agree with yourself. Let's say I see a burning orphanage. I run in to save any child left in the orphanage, and I end up knocking a man down as I run in to save children, I see him but don't stop because I know he will be able to get up and save himself, though I'm trying to go as fast as I can. I can use the good I was doing to justify knocking the man down. Right? So far so good. I'm still a hero, and I should suffer no serious consequence or legal repercussion for the slight misdeed which happened in the course of doing some good. \n\nNow let's add to this: I've grabbed and picked up 3 children passed out from the smoke. On my way out of the house to save these children's lives, I also see an elderly women trying to leave, too. As I run by the women, I kick her in the face, and leave her unconscious on the floor to die, and she ultimately does die from the smoke/fire combined with my assault. \n\nI have done some good, but doing the good things I've done, although they were simultaneously at the same time of the bad, doesn't undo the horrible thing I did. And I don't get use saving those children as a shield or defense of some crime that was not required or logically connected to the heroic activity. Do we still agree? \n\nIf you agree so far, then why do you defend Snowden? And I don't mean the illegal activities he exposed, but the legal espionage activities he leaked. That makes him a criminal, by all apparency and he ought to stand trial for those crimes. Saying anything less is either ignorant or delusional. Which are you?

That's very different from the DSK allegations.","aSentId": 4382,"answer": "&gt;DSK wasn't prosecuted for the same kind of rape then Anssage.\n\n::blinks::\n\n In the US, we don't have kinds of rape. Rape is rape. The kind doesn't matter. My point was that high profile people are expensive to prosecute for a variety of reasons. This is a good example.\n\n&gt;No, I never said that, I simply made an example that there should be some kind of proportionality.\n\nYou used an example which made light of the accusations and still fail to understand what the proportionality is related to. It's not to the crime of rape, its to the issue of defying the legal system and making it an international issue.

There is simply no possible way to \"donate\" or \"support\" an author.  It's just not part of the accounting model.  You can't generate a PO or reimburse a credit-card purchase for a donation.  There's simply no mechanism to do it!\n\nHowever, one particular company has a free/open source version of their software that is completely functional for our purposes.  They also sell a license key for very similar \"pro\" version with a few exclusive token features which we could probably do without.  They also have an automated quote-generation system (which is needed for initiating a PO in most businesses).  I happily send them a few hundred each year whenever software license renewals come up, because we actually like the software and want to support further development.  The fact that they sell something tangible allows us to actually support them.  If they just had a \"donate\" button or sold \"technical support\" I would not be able to find a way to get money from our bank account to their bank account.\n\nTL;DR You *need* three things : \n#1) Justificaiton for a corporate purchase on paper, even if that justification is bullshit (i.e. I totally need non-trivial feature x found only in pro version of software to complete my task efficiently) \n\n#2) A quote.  Most places I've worked operate on purchase orders.  You need to quote a price for your product before I can even start the process.\n\n#3) Something in return for money you spend.

It describes a collection of several territories. It's very similar in \"the United States\" or \"the Bahamas\" in that sense.\n\nNowadays, the Dutch simply call it \"Nederland\", which is a singular form, but the area used to be known as the \"Republiek der Zeven Verenigde Nederlanden\" or \"Republic of the Seven United Netherlands\", back in the . Each \"Netherland\" was one of the provinces, although the word wasn't used in singular form. Rather, each of these 7 territories was simply known as a \"provincie\" or \"gewest\". Together, they formed the Netherlands. This was back in the Golden Age, around 1600, the time when the VOC was still conducting business.\n\nThe country has had several slightly different names during different periods, such as \"The United Kingdom of the Netherlands\" during the early 19th century.\n\nNowadays, there is still the \"Koninkrijk der Nederlanden\" or \"Kingdom of the Netherlands\". This kingdom is composed of several countries (we're confusing like that, something we have in common with the British). These countries are the area known as \"Nederland\" (still called by its plural form \"Netherlands\" in English), and the island countries of Aruba, Cura\u00e7ao and Sint-Maarten. So again, it's plural, because the kingdom is composed of multiple countries, or multiple \"Netherlands\", so to speak.\n\nWe also like to do it in front of singular nouns, such as \"kingdom\" (the United Kingdom), \"republic\" (the Dominican Republic) etc.\n\n**TL;DR**: We like to use articles when a nation's name is actually a plural. It's a purely grammatical reason. We also like to put an article in front of nouns. \"Ukraine\" is neither multiple, nor a noun, and as such it's incorrect to say \"the Ukraine\".","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13","qSentId": 5736,"question": "How would you explain \"The Netherlands\"?","aSentId": 5739,"answer": "It should be \"the Netherlands\", like \"the United States\" or \"the UK\".

Ok first lets look at rich people, why do people say the \"Rich get richer\", because people that are not rich lose money due to inflation. They can barely keep up with the cost of goods and living. Rich people typically own a lot of stocks, real estate, bonds. The stocks and real estate increase in value due to inflation. You - lose money, no savings. Them - always earn money. When the federal government decides to shore up the economy (bailouts) by buying stocks and bonds, rich people get richer. Stock market index goes up 10%, and someone that earned 997 million dollars, now has a paper net worth of 1.09 billion dollars. Another person on the billionaire list, while you (everyone else) have another year of paltry earnings and little savings. So in this way alone you can expect individual people to have 100 billion dollars in the near future.\n\nLiquidity improvements: basically solving the need to tap into value that isn't accessible. Buyers and sellers do not know about each other.  Its like when you want to sell an old phone on craigslist, you wait for a day or two and you get a buyer. But if you want to sell two phones, you have to wait four days, for that random second buyer. Now imagine there was no craigslist. Craigslist solved a liquidity problem. \n\nThis same concept scales up. People have lots of things of value, and in some circumstances, these things actually solve a need! So you have the guy with a giant orchard in Florida, this is worth a lot of money, but not if it costs him too much to find buyers. So someone builds a bridge to his estate, and someone else builds an electronic marketplace and now the costs to get to the fruits are solved. People are bidding for the oranges in realtime online and will go get trucks themselves to pick them up. Now the person rich in fruits is rich in dollars. Something there was no market for, now suddenly has value. The next challenge is to bring more people to this market, so that the orchard owner has more people to sell to. \n\nIn the broad market, problems like this are being solved on an international scale. It is fascinating to me how far we've come, and fascinating to see where we could be, in this regard. The big stock exchanges are just merging across continents now. (like the recent NYSE and Euronext merger). Intercontinental exchanges are a new thing, so you can expect companies to raise MORE capital in their initial public offerings - when their stock starts trading. Now that you have an exchange that can easily facilitate buyers in the US and France, without making a person jump through hoops to get basic banking services in a foreign country. You can expect the CEOs of those new big companies to have greater net worths.\n\n","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13","qSentId": 6494,"question": "Exactly, that's what I meant.

","aSentId": 6776,"answer": "Agreed.  Plus the common cold is hardly some monolithic disease causing agent like say the measles virus.  Many viruses are capable of causing the cold, and likely all use a distinctly different method of packaging their genome.  Hell this article is lazy in the sense that it simply refers to all cold viruses as RNA viruses.  This is untrue, off the top of my head I can name the adenovirus family which has a double stranded DNA genome.  Such a genome would prevent the formation of hairpin structures as shown in the graphic from forming.  This means that it must employ a different mechanism for genome encapsidation.  \n\nThe article however does bear some truth.  If we can find a way to disrupt viral packaging for a particular disease, essentially the best an infected cell can do is turn out a bomb casing without a payload.  Release of viral capsids without a genome allows for the entry, but not the hijacking of a new cell.  Such research is interesting because we may find a way to shorten the course of a disease in the clinical setting.

Making things worse, the exact way you pronounce your native R of L sounds is slightly affected by surrounding sounds, which may sound like completely different sounds to foreigners.\n\nSo the Japanese R is a sound that is made somewhat like how we make an L, but depending on the vowels around it the shape changes and we can hear R, L, or D.\n\nKorean has one L-letter (simplified) that they pronounce six different ways depending on where it appears (sort of like our \"S\" can be ssss or zzzz or shh or other things in different words, but weirder). That makes it kind of hard, but not impossible, for them to nail liquids in other languages. \n\nTechnically standard Chinese R's are very close to *American* Rs, but not at all similar to *Spanish* Rs. But Americans still associate Chinese with liquid confusion because many there are 2 billion of them and only very few speak a very \"standard\" Chinese; and historically most of the Chinese-ethnicity (Han) diaspora didn't speak the official language of China (Mandarin) at all but rather Cantonese or Minnan.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13","qSentId": 7653,"question": "Isn't it only the Japanese that have problem with R?
