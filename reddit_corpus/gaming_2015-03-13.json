First, as you said, it looks and feels a heck of a lot like Civ V with a space-age reskin. Most of the core mechanics are virtually the same, and it doesn't really feel as though Beyond Earth brings anything new or interesting to the table. For example, the orbital units mechanic feels as though it could have been much more than minor tile bonuses and occasional, dubiously useful military applications.\n\nSecond, it's substantially faster than Civ V, in terms of overall game pace. Regardless of the time setting and map size, games naturally play through to completion noticeably quicker. This isn't a bad thing per se, but it feeds into my third criticism.\n\nThird, the overall scope of the game is reduced from Civ V, which is just plain weird. There's only 8 playable civilizations, and the differences between them seem less thought-through than most Civ V civilizations. Map sizes seem to be universally reduced from Civ V scale (I searched around and couldn't find any explicit confirmation of this, such as hex counts. But even the largest maps are limited to 8 factions, so there's that). This is probably an effort to reduce mid-late game lag that was so infamous in Civ V. Also, the affinity system is vastly simpler than the ideology system of Civ V. All of these factors combined result in lower replay value, which is where we circle back to my second point - you've got faster games than Civ V with less reason to come back.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh03", "qSentId": 25613, "question": "to alpha centauri?

And you can blast a wall in order to breach through it, whereas now you have to use HE grenades.\n\nEverything else, like ammo or night missions, just seems like a gimmick.", "aSentId": 25901, "answer": "Original X-Com was a basically a 4X game that focused on managing **very** limited resources.    \n\nYup, X1 had \"Shoot at this spot\".  Could be a wall, could be middle of the field.    Your shots could miss, and hit someone, or something else...  I head-shotted so many of my troops with that...\n\nThe game took place on the earth (literally, little model earth) which had Day/night cycles.   Sometimes the aliens would land in/attack a location on the night side.  You had the option to leave them be, but they might be gone by time the sun came up, doing dastardly deeds under the cover of night, which had some harsh repercussions.\n\n\nAmmo being a gimmick?   It's another resource.   \n\n* Standard ammo was cheap, and you could just buy it.  No worries.\n* Laser weapons, human invention, didn't have \"ammo\", just used magical batteries that never depleted.   (Could also shoot through human walls)\n* Plasma weapons, researched from Alien Tech used \"Elerium\", which was an element \"not found on earth\", so the only want to get it was to attack alien craft, or bases (if they set one up), could shoot through most human and alien walls.\n\nDitto the vehicle fuel.   Standard jet fuel?  No problem.   If you researched the Alien Tech to get THEIR drive systems or weapons (which you needed to just to reliably down some of the UFOs), they used Elerium.

The biggest improvement is definitely the 3D which is a *lot* better IMO. \n\nWith the 3DS you generally have to keep it kind of still-ish to not mess up the 3D and can't really move your head around or anything, so I tend to not play with the 3D on. However, you can move a lot more with the new one because it tracks your face and makes sure that the 3D projection follows with you, if that makes sense.\n\nThere are other improvements too of course. The C-stick is nice but is largely unnecessary because games haven't been built for it but games will come out now that do (Monster Hunter is a lot better with it). It also runs some games better/makes new ones look prettier (MH4 is waaay better looking on an N3DS).\n\nKeep in mind though that now you can get a used normal 3DS or XL for even cheaper because some people are selling them as they upgrade. Even when I bought in late 2012 after the XL came out, I got two used normal 3DSes for $200 with a bunch of games and I like it just fine. Zelda and Pokemans and Marios all play the same so far on that as the N3DS, so the back catalog won't change. \n\nBinding of Isaac would probably be better with the C-stick, but it'd work just fine with buttons.

I really do.  But EVERY thing about this game makes me hate it. Sorry for the incoming rant.\n\nI have, what I'd like to call a pretty monster PC that so far... Runs everything at Ultra... Not Unity though.\n\nUnity kind-of runs at High (there's still very high+ultra) on my computer, looks much shittier then games such as MGSV for PC or Sleeping Dogs even and plays worse.\n\nOne of my horror stories of the game from yesterday, I went back to see if they made it work yet... I was in for the biggest surprise of my gaming life yet.\n\nSo I DL the new updates through UPlay, load the game up... for some reason my screen is 1680x1050 instead of 1920.  Whatever, it happens when you load up games the first time on PC, the res isn't always right.\nSo I go to settings change the resolution to 1920x1080 and the game freezes for a few minutes.  Keep in mind I'm sitting in the main menu (not even in game) and the game totally locks my computer... something no game has yet to do to me even if it has froze.  So I stick around and luckily hit the \"Would you like to keep this resolution?\" with 2 seconds to spare.\n\nAwesome lets try alt+tabbing.  Oh god this was a grave mistake.  What's going on?  We'll say alt+tabbing takes a minute or two between minimizing the game and maximizing the game.\n\nSo lets try setting it to windowed mode at 1600x800?  Go to settings go do it... freezes for a good 5 minutes but I can see it windowed and just unfreezing--fine.  So I wait, wait... and finally my whole screen goes black.  Wtf?  Wait another 5... and realize I wasn't able to hit the \"Keep the changes\" because it was too locked up from the heavy load of the main menu I Guess?\n\nAnyways we'll long story short: I got window mode to work...

Here, the probability of a \"a mass murdering steampunk-wig-cap-that-covers-90%-of-their-face-wearing person\" showing up at a school to kill everyone would be such a movie thing that no one would actually run away, they would just straight up not believe it is happening. As such, any \"terrorist safety\" rule is preposterous and a waste of time. \n\nAnyway, I understand why american schools have a hat rule based on the first thing you said. The second reason (distracting) is irrelevant. Students who don't want to pay attention won't. And gangs will fly the colours they want, with or without a hat. It's not like not having a hat will stop them from being part of the gang. \n\nSchools do have the weirdest rules. I had a teacher who wouldn't allow boys to wear tank tops for some reason. Just boys too. And in the highschool I went to, kids weren't allowed to close the bathroom doors. How fucked up is that? I hate rules that affect your everyday life, yet are only there to protect you from the rarest of occasions. I hope, as a teacher, you can take a critical look at all the rules in the places you look, from more than one perspective and be flexible with your students. \n\nSorry for the huge text, I just have nothing to do at work and I still hate my highschool experience. ", "aSentId": 31493, "answer": "The steampunk comment was completely tongue-in-cheek... But I can't disagree more about safety rules being a waste of time. It is not unreasonable to lock external doors and require check-ins through the office so that strangers don't wander around, it's not unreasonable to have a plan to hide and/or remove students from danger. For the same reasons you should know how to exit your house in case of a fire, you should have a plan for other emergencies as well. \n\nAs to your comment about distraction, it is absolutely not irrelevant. Removing distractions is paramount to improving student learning. I've typed up a half dozen arguments as to why, but I realize that unless you've tried to teach a room full of children how to do something, you'll never understand how distracting silly hats could be. Hell, a mechanical pencil can distract some kids from a lesson where the rest of the class is completely engaged.\n\nTeachers are some of the most flexible people you'll ever meet, and sure, we make exceptions for the rules when we really think it will benefit a child or group of children, but the rules that are in place ARE there for a reason in most cases. ", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh03", "qSentId": 31482, "question": "As a teacher, I would imagine that the school rule on hats/hoods is in place for many reasons, one of them being so that an outside intruder would not be able to easily \"blend in\" and infiltrate the school. I recognize most of the kids in my school from the front or the back, but if some intruder decided to dress like a student and pull a hood down over their head, they may be able to avoid attention. \n\nA second reason is because hats can be distracting. Do we make the rule that only baseball caps are allowed? Huge sun hats? Stovepipe top hats? Cat in the hat hats?\n\nOr the hats can be used to fly gang colors, depending upon your location.\n\nSchools rarely do things for no reason, even if it may seem that way at first glance.
