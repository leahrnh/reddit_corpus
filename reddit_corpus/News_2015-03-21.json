Using a combination of the camera and sort mode, you can shuffle the deck in the sequential pattern it came in. Most cases, it's (from bottom to top), A - K (hearts), A - K (clubs), K - A (diamonds), K - A (spades) assuming no joker in the deck. \n\nInstead of 'shuffle' mode, the dipshit dealer had it in 'sort' mode. Every time he shuffled the cards, the outcome was exactly the same. Despite the positions and big/small blind changing, every other player immediately knew the outcome of the cards and played accordingly. After 20 hands, the floor supervisor figured it out and raised hell (with our service team of course). They didn't pursue the matter as poker is a player vs player game (not player vs house). The casino still made their rake each hand and let the players keep their winnings. It was up to the players to divide the winnings how they saw fit. Most players knew each other and had a big laugh.

However, I think with the older generation sort of going away and a younger generation stepping in I think this will change. Though it will not be the land of milk and honey where all is fair, I think that we will realize that a nation is stronger with relatively more transparency. Keep in mind that the internet and accessible video is still relatively new and a lot is very surprising to others so the immediate remedy is to put an end to it, which ultimately drives the interest more. The key will be to make it work for everyone and then people will stop caring as the thrill of being on one side or the other is no there as both sides are mixed together.\n\nFurthermore, did you really quote one person and use his opinion as a foundation for your argument? Yes, as Americans we are rather confident as a nation but can you blame us when we are coming down from being the most powerful country in the world, and by a lot? Additionally, would you rather people be passive and hopeless? How is being optimistic a curse? Should we just not believe in a better future? Should we also think that we cannot make it work? That things will get better? \n\nYou make a lot of claims, which I am seriously interested in hearing your opinions on them and how as Americans we should behave and act to become a better nation. Additionally, how will having the outlook as the state and everyone being an enemy strengthen and unite us. The thing we need is unity, instead of things that will push us away from each other. Would you like a power like ISIS or Russia or even China to be world power or would you rather have America, as imperfect as they are, be in power. I would argue that with America at least the people and the government is more accepting than the rest of the world.
