Are there algorithmic improvements? A different API? More permissive license?\n\nObviously you do have such a story or you wouldn't have bothered writing this package. I think you should make that prominent -- put it in the README file, abstract of the paper, first section of the docs, etc. A discussion of where the comparative advantage lies versus other tools would go a long way towards helping the people who ought to be using this package realize that they ought to be using it.
