Eric and Eliza are wonderful and supportive people who make it their job to realize the visions of their writers, which I've heard is not always the case in big houses.

","aSentId": 12037,"answer": "I think the NYT list is imperfect but acceptable for it's purpose.  I don't read the fiction categories of the NYT list to find interesting new authors.  I think if we want to approach that problem we'd need a very different type of list.  After all, if I'm interested in finding new breakouts I wouldn't trust most book critics because my tastes and theirs rarely jibe.  \n\nI think the best tool for that is something like what amazon used to have where people made lists of favorites and you could find on each book's page some lists that included that book.  Then you could find people whose lists seem to match your interests and find others books on that list you've never read.  Unfortunately, amazon dumped that because they preferred being paid by publishers or authors to put books higher on the algorithm that suggested books to customers.  Goodreads is sort of an alternative, but I think it only works if you have facebook or google+ friends with similar interests.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh4i","qSentId": 12034,"question": "How the New York Times Bestseller List Works","aSentId": 12039,"answer": "Thank you for this!","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh4i","qSentId": 12041,"question": "Wheel of Time TV show quietly debuted in the middle of last night.

","aSentId": 12251,"answer": "A critics' job is to be critical. So that actually gives us two pretty good reasons that a critic might be averse to having fun. The first is that criticism is never any fun. The second is that it's their job, and jobs themselves are rarely fun. The reason jobs aren't fun is that you have to do a \"good job\" in order to continue being paid, or at least look like you're doing a good job. Now, it's a lot harder to dislike things than like them(the highlights of a book are often so much more obvious than the low points). Pointing out negative things makes the critic look more intelligent, and dare I say more...critical, and thus gives the appearance that the critic is good at what he does. \n\nIn any case, I think it's hardly the end of the world if a critic is critical of a book. His function is to give you an idea of whether you would want to read the book or not. If his least favorite part of the book sounds like something you'd like, then in a roundabout way I guess he did a pretty good job of exposing you to the book.
