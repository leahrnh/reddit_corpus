The account holder is responsible for the money and to report it to the authorities in his home country so the old-school Swiss banker 'law' was basically to not ask any questions. \n\nBetween 2000-2007 this changed quite a bit when Swiss private banks started to actively solicit clients abroad. By that they usually violated laws in foreign countries. Also theoretically it's even illegal in Switzerland to actively support tax fraud, however, this is tax evasion and again basically the responsibility of the client under Swiss law. \n\nThe difference between tax fraud and tax evasion in Switzerland is that tax fraud is actively reporting wrong information to tax authorities (e.g. faking your income/wage statement) whereas tax evasion is more passive in a sense that you simply not report something to the tax authorities (you can basically claim that you forgot about it). Under Swiss law the difference is that tax evasion is considered to be a much lower crime that, when detected, usually result in a fine and you will have to pay taxes in retrospective, whereas tax fraud is considered to be a higher crime for which you can go to jail.\n\nIn case of tax fraud the Swiss banks would always provide information (same thing with e.g. terrorism) because it's a higher category of crime, whereas tax evasion wasn't considered to be bad enough make bank reveal information about their clients. So if e.g. an American wouldn't report his Swiss bank account then the Swiss banks would consider this the fault of the client but would not see a reason to reveal information.

The majority of people can't pay for their fair share because they don't make enough.  \n\nThe French Revolution was basically caused because when everyone paid their (as you put it) \"fair share\" it meant that the poor were even more destitute, while the wealthy barely paid anything.  Even on a proportional percentage share, where everyone would pay the same amount in percentages (usually put at 9%), the poor are still more adversely effected because that 9% is the different between being able to afford rent and food, and only able to afford rent OR food.  While for the rich, the 9% just means that they will only be able to afford 20% less cocaine for their parties.  \n\n\nThe reason that a progressive tax rate, where rich pay a higher percentage, is justifiable is because the increased wealth means that the money they lose to taxes means less to them.  It also takes less out of the economy.  Supply side economics just don't work because when the rich get more money from the government, it goes to buying a more expensive boat, or a bigger house, which might only benefit a few people.  But if the poor get more money from the government, a lot of poor people get the money and spend it on things like food (which supports farmers and food packers) or clothing, or cars, or ovens, or other necessary items, which en masse employ a shitton more people and is generally better for the government.

Everyone knows they won't comply, so why should we?\n\nIn short, fuck Switzerland and fuck the Swiss.","aSentId": 15439,"answer": "No, you're totally wrong about the way our economy works.\n\nFirst off, the wealth and stability doesn't come from the money itself, it comes from the well-working system, which in turn attracts the world's money.  \n\nThe money originates mostly in the business-friendly environment, it's not extremely hard to start a company over here - actually most of our companies are so called \"KMU's\" (translates to \"small to medium-sized businesses) - and the big and foreign companies sometimes even get tax-breaks I believe (which is a bit antisocial and should be changed, but it's not as bad as that it would make us the devil), so it's pretty ridiculous to think that the majority of our wealth is funded on grabbing dirty money from all over the world.\n\nSure, we're a save haven, so the money-launderers of this world will obviously flock to our country - but at least our government recently took action to combat this: the banking secret for foreigners, in practice, doesn't exist anymore, it only still exists for swiss citizens.\n\nOf course these things will take time to really have an effect, but our land isn't functioning so well mainly because we have money, it's primarily because we manage what we have very well.\n\nTry to view it from our perspective: the citizens here definitely don't want to support any crookery for their own benefit, but as we have a long history of liberty and independence (which worked perfectly for us), we don't want and shouldn't have to give up any of that liberty and independence. If anything, everyone else should adopt our system, because it's obviously superior and better working than any other in the world.  \n\nBut most here also have a strong sense of justice, so they wouldn't simply tolerate an injustice if they got to know of it.\nSo our solution is: as long as we have the best system in the world, we're keeping control of what's going down in our own country (which is also why we would never join the EU, it's not egoism, it's that we don't trust anybody else with our own reins but ourselves), but we'll help anyone who needs our support in something we deem worthy of our support, in other words: if your country needs juristic help with something we also deem a crime, we're glad to help.  \nAnd tax evasion is a crime here too, so we'll of course help if we get to know of it, but we'll help after our own laws, not yours.\n\nTL;DR Switzerland is not antisocial, it just doesn't trust anyone else with their own reins.\n\nAnd also, we saved lots of Jews in WWII, we actually took in as many as we could support at the time. I think I read that the ones that were turned away were turned away because we already took up so many that we weren't able to support any more, which is of course sad, but let's not forget that we still did our best, all while being surrounded by the axis. We even had to convert soccer fields into crop fields and stuff like that, so it wasn't all easy-peasy as you might think now.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l","qSentId": 15443,"question": "I am sure the list will be classified by the Congress in no time.","aSentId": 15444,"answer": "&gt; Congress \n\nNice reading skills.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l","qSentId": 15448,"question": "Aren't Swiss banks infamous for foreigners using it to evade tax?","aSentId": 15449,"answer": "Shouldn't be but still happens, although since a year ago banks have to pretty much release all data for foreigners.

","aSentId": 17125,"answer": "'Should' is a funny word.\n\nBiologically speaking, it was a good system for perpetuating the species. Was even primed for improvement of individuals - they knew enough about genetics to create super-humans as well as Epsilon-minuses.\n\nSociologically speaking, it was a good system that created stability, something humans have been striving for since we started living in groups. They had 'release valves' (read:orgies, among other things) to relieve societal tension and prevent conflict. Remember Mustafa Mond's soliloquy in the first chapter, where he ascribed destabilization to the overbuildup of unresolved tension? There was that pipe analogy about piercing it a dozen times to reduce a jet of water to a trickle. Jets of water can cut metal; trickles irrigate fields.\n\nEcologically speaking, it's hard to tell. It definitely was a consumer-driven society, with that bumblepuppy sport being invented to take up more equipment and a love of nature being discouraged because it didn't consume enough. They did practice population control, though, so it would be easy enough to make sure the ecological carrying capacity wasn't taxed to the breaking point.\n\nEconomically speaking, it was pretty ideal. People were employed, goods were produced and consumed. No poverty. I'll grant you a caste system, but I'd argue that you can't have a society without it. There's always shit work to be done. At least in BNW, it was done by people suited for the job. Even in real life, not everyone is capable or would even be satisfied with a white collar job. Some people just like hammering things together, and we need mechanics and septic-tank-servicers as much as (or more than) advertising executives.\n\nScientifically speaking, it was advanced in some ways. We know they had great insight into genetics, medicine, pharmacology, psychology and sociology. We've no idea about other fields, as it wasn't mentioned. In real life, science is driven by two things: War and Profit. Millions of dollars of research goes into things like drugs for growing longer eyelashes. The examples of science in BNW were at least devoted to bettering life for the entirety of society.\n\nIn real life, everyone is programmed. Not by sleep learning, but by their surrounding culture. Take, for instance, a very very macro look at Far Eastern cultures vs. American ones. Note the difference of importance placed on family, respect for tradition, and concepts of independence. What seems foreign and reprehensible to one is innate and ideal to another.\n\nWhat would questioning the system in BNW accomplish? It was communicated, from several viewpoints (so corroborating evidence removes theories of the Unreliable Narrator), that there was nothing to be gained by rocking the boat. Lena was happy in her job, pleased by her popularity and satisfied with her lot in life. Bertrand was unhappy because he was jealous of not getting laid enough and had low self-esteem issues. He rocked the boat and realized his problems were internal, not external. Heimholtz thought, like you posited, that humans should be/were capable of more. \n\nTo me, Mustafa Mond was, by far, the most interesting character in the book. He was capable of examining society's current position with the previous one. He consciously chose stability over chaos. Heimholtz chose chaos and, importantly, was released from his gilded cage to pursue what he wanted, off to write poetry in the Aleutian Islands. \n\nI'd say the experiences of Lena, Bertrand, and Heimholtz demonstrate the fact that yes, the residents were capable of questioning their society.

Nothing the company does can protect the user against a determined hacker, that risk will always be present and a possibility. The real issue here is that people think they are always recording, which is patently false, people think this is an avenue for them to collect private information on purpose with intent to use it, which it is not. All this change means is as I stated that if someone is speaking in the background when a user goes to utilize voice control/recognition then whatever that background speaker is saying will also get picked up and processed. If the person is not using one of the key words used to trigger a command in the TV then at most it will cause the user to have to speak their command again as the system may fail to recognize the command at least however it will likely be used to improve voice recognition in situations where multiple voices are present in the recording being sent for processing. This is another instance of people freaking out over nothing due to their own ignorance of the technology and how it works.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l","qSentId": 19579,"question": "I hate to sound like a tin foil hat guy (because i'm not) but I have noticed my facebook ads have been geared toward products they think I would like and its not based on anything i've googled, but have spoken to other people in person about.

I'd gladly pay an extra couple bucks.\n\nFor example, Trader Joes sells a frozen pizza that says it's \"hand made made in italy\" and normally I look at something like that and think \"yeah, they want me to think it's some quaint little baker in the italian countryside making it, but it's probably some huge factory, and the people pushing the buttons use their hands. Maybe it's not even made in italy, maybe it's just packaged there or something.\"\n\nBut then on the back of the box is an actual picture of the pizzas being made, and it's not a quaint little baker, but you can actually see what's going on. The pizzas are on a conveyor belt, and the people are all wearing white coats and hairnets, and the oven is a big stainless steel thing, but ...\n\nThey are actually making them by hand, and the oven is actually burning wood, and it looks like a nice place, not a quaint bakery, but not a giant factory either.\n\nThis is the kind of picture that 99% of companies wouldn't put on their package because they want you to use your imagination and think things are actually nicer than they actually are. But in this case, they can show you the truth, and it's actually pretty good.\n\nThat's the complete opposite of these ag-gag laws.
