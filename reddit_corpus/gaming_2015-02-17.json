The games are good, they're worth the price, and they're selling a good amount even years after release - that's why OOT3D still retails for $35 or whatever despite it's a 4-year-old remake of a 17-year-old game.","aSentId": 29986,"answer": "&gt; The thing about Nintendo games is they have a much higher level of polish and stronger art direction than most anything else out there, and because of this they not only have a big appeal but they age way better than anything else.

With the recent consoles, the Wii ESPECIALLY, there were very very few games that weren't first party that were actually worth playing. It's easier to build a good library on the N64/GC for sure.\n\nAdmittedly, I'm not much of a Playstation guy, but I had a PS2 back in the day and have had a backwards-compatible PS3 since 2007. The thing about PS2 games is that there are some good games for sure, but a lot of the really great PS2 games are multi-platform and I will do anything to avoid playing the PS2 version of a game because it's pretty much always inferior to the GC/XBOX versions.\n\nIn my opinion Playstation has always had the library for sure, but they don't have the quality control.

I love Melee, and still play it at friends' houses, but I have zero reason to play it alone. I definitely never had less games to play than when I just had an N64 and Gamecube though. Granted, RPGs and shmups are two of my favourite genres, but I was pretty much always resigned to the fact that a game I wanted to play wasn't coming out for the system I had. I'm a 'whichever system has the most games I want to play' kind of guy.\n\nIn the N64 days I rented literally everything that wasn't a first party game, because 9/10 times it would be crap. My friends got Metal Gear Solid, I got Winback, I guess? My friends got Final Fantasy VII, I got Quest 64? They got Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, I got Castlevania 64. \n\nI mean I'm playing through Majora's Mask again on 3DS right now, and Banjo Tooie is one of my favourite games, but when it came to the Cube era Metroid Prime and Wind Waker are probably my only two all time favourites, besides Melee, but again, that's almost solely a game to play with buddies or something. Sometimes you'd luck out and get a superior port, but I don't always rank polish above the overall experience, whether it's the story or the experience or the conventions. I mean, Killer7 is one of my all time faves of the generation and it's not really a 'fun' game at all. I would honestly just rather own one console and resign myself to never playing the new Mario or whatever the case is. I can still play SMW or Galaxy 2 on the Wii I have.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh03","qSentId": 29694,"question": "If only it knew what Melee's going for these days.

Like, the fact that cancels can be used within combos is the groundbreaking feature that makes Melee such a pedestal of the Smash family.\n\n\nIn other games, that stuff is passe, it's second nature, it's an expected part of the game. You don't see people spouting that rhetoric about Tekken or Marvel or KOF or anything else is because canceling and dash canceling aren't some amazing, mindblowing techniques that make them stand out - they're an expected part of the game as much an integral part of them as jumping that everyone already knows about and they stopped being special almost a decade ago - saying the new Street Fighter will have canceling in it is about as much a no brainer as saying it will have blocking.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh03","qSentId": 30231,"question": "&gt;It's arguably the most complex and technical fighting game ever\n\nAnyone that would argue this point has never played a fighting game outside of Smash more complex than Primal Rage.

An Astro gaming headset would be nice, but they are so expensive.  I stopped buying Logitech because the G35 I had kept snapping the earpiece off, which is a known issue.

You've an option in the menu to choose and get special in-game currency by installing and starting app from the list. Some you might like. If not - you just delete them right after you finish. I don't recall any ads poping up or something.\n\nProblem with this game is that you can buy stuff that feel essential, like extra hotbar slot for your skills. At the beginning of the game you've enough of them, but while you're leveling, you'll need to have more slots to use your character efficiently, so you don't have to change skills set equipped every time you change your tactic or when you want to play two roles at once (dmg + heal) when necessary. \n\nThe other thing are bag slots - although it appears you've unlimited slots, you have a certain limit of the items you can carry and if you exceed it, you won't be able to fast travel. And the same situation happens - over a time, you'll need to buy them to play efficiently. Another thing that also annoys me is the possibility to reset your skill/attributes points that you also have to buy with the special currency. Basically if you're newbie and you fuck up progressing through the game, you've either farm by installing apps or buy this option with real money. I think it would be more fair to buy such items with regular in game currency (and if you need to speed things up, you could just buy the gold).\n\nI can even forgive for the potions (that also could be essential in such kind of game, but there are skills for that) or gold you can buy with this special currency. \n\nWhat i can't forgive is that you have to buy yourself game mechanics, that shouldn't be sold and that it will just make game barely playable over the time if you don't buy them. \n\nBoosts, hats, special mounts or gold, whatever.

I bought Fruit Ninja and got Shazam for free during a holiday app giveaway.  About a year later they both started introducing ads which were never there before.  Fruit Ninja was now literally no different than the free version.  These ads also made it unplayable on my old phone, and I uninstalled it.  I kept Shazam because the core functionality still worked, although it was still annoying.  Eventually Fruit Ninja removed the ads and returned it to normal paid status which I really appreciate (but I didn't appreciate the ads in the first place so im still peeved about that).\n\nWhat I don't like, however, is that not only did Shazam never give me the ad-free experience back, but introduced a new ad-free app!

This idea is *BULLSHIT*. Now, you had games coming out missing features that were part of the core game from the beginning that you had to pay extra for. The gaming press started largely overlooking this, save for a few exceptions, and the mass market sheep who only came into the hobby when it became a mass media bought it because they didn't know any better.\n\nIt's not that I want everything for free, it's than when I pay $60 for a game, I want a complete game for my $60.

I completely understand that developing software has costs associated with it, and that people who choose to develop software for a living need to eat and put a roof over their heads.\n\nThe problem is that the mobile app sector has gotten really sleazy. \n\nI think this is something that needs to be discussed in a fair and honest way because there is blame to go around for everyone and until everyone understands it, finding a solution will be more difficult than it already is.\n\nThe first problem is the sense of entitlement that the average mobile consumer has developed. This is partially because of marketing from Apple and Google/Android Handset Makers about the great free apps available on their platforms and from Apple's early iTunes price ceilings. This has make people expect apps to be free or at most dirt cheap. Any solution to the problem has to wean people off of this mentality.\n\nThe behaviors of mobile consumers, however, should not excuse sleazy business practices. The problem is, however, the sleazy practices are the most lucrative. When you're looking at the numbers as a developer/publisher, it's really easy to pull that handle given the limited margins caused by the first problem. If charging $5 tanks installs, while micro-transactions or forced ad watching keeps installs up and brings in revenue as people use it, it can feel like the only way to make money in the industry is to embrace the bullshit.

It built the ad into the game design. All good services and apps make it unobtrusive when they advertise to you, so as to not be a blight on the service. I have the Meriam Webster dictionary on my phone, and I'll literally be in the middle of typing my word when it suddenly throws a fullscreen ad over top which I inevitably accidentally tap on. That's how you do it poorly. In this case, the game designer has included the option: take a set back in the game which won't bother you with an ad but costs you progress, or keep your progress for the cost of maybe 30 seconds of your time. I don't know what that game is, but it appears to be a cookie clicker clone from the \"bananas per second\"  at the top. If the game is still playing itself while the ad runs, essentially you've lost no gameplay from watching the ad. You're still progressing even as it plays. It's clever. I like it.

One could argue that this mechanic helps the player feel like they're accomplishing something. If you have a game like cookie clicker with constant progress watching a number go up, once you buy enough upgrades and you just keep growing for no reason and with no fail state and with no challenges, you'll just eventually grow bored. If the game isn't selling any power ups or in app purchases, and it gets all the revenue from ads... devs gotta put food on the table somehow. Giving a real reason to watch that ad may be inconvenient, but at least a choice is given. I don't play many games on my phone because a lot of devs simply don't give you any choice. You either wait days for things to happen, or you buy the $12.99 gem pack. You either watch this ad I've suddenly thrown in your face without warning, or you close the app and come back later maybe. if this game asks before giving you an ad, doesn't do it too frequently (and if it takes 5 million bananas a second before you get an ad to make you want to uninstall, I think they're pretty infrequent), I say it does it fairly nicely. \n\nI think the mobile market in general is awful, if it means anything.

So either you pay for it, or you have ads or other ways to make up for the money. I'm not saying you can't be against the free to play model. That's perfectly valid to believe that paying for an item up front is the best way to go. But, I don't think this example is what is wrong with these models.\n\nAn example of it being done wrong, is a game being designed around micro transactions. ie. The game itself is altered in such a way, that the game experience is gimped -- thus forcing you to buy micro transactions to play the game in a reasonable way. When a games design is completely gimped and designed in a way where the only way to really play it (in a reasonable way) is to pay for micro-transactions, then that is bad game design.\n\nAs a side note....\n\nI always find it funny when I see activists and feminists getting all up in arms about there not being more equality in terms of female representation. Being critical, using your voice as a consumer and letting them know what you want -- that is 100% okay. But outright condemning devs/publishers and saying they are immoral for not making things more equal, is laughable. This is a business. Their job isn't to make the world a better, more equal place. Yes, ideally, it would be wonderful if games (and media in general) was more diverse, equal, and fair. But at the end of the day, their sole goal is to make money. And when it cost so much to fund film/games, they are going to go after the demographics/stats that show they will I. Have a high chance of success. II. Getting the most profit possible.\n\nI think people think it's this personal thing. If the majority of AAA game consumers were female, you better believe they would be making more games aimed towards females, or with a higher slant/bias towards female characters. Again, I have nothing against people being critical. Or consumers using their voice to let people know what they -- as consumers, want. But the whole \"if you don't do this, you are sexist\", or if you don't do this, you are immoral\"...I mean lol.\n\nIt again is not their job to make things more equal. Of course it would be amazing if more games had more representation of females and minorities. Not only because there are many gamers who are female or minority, but because EVERYONE would benefit if we had more diversity. But at the end of the day, we aren't the ones putting up millions to make these things. We aren't beholden to stock holders, with our jobs depending on performance. \n\nI guess to tie this all together. As a consumer, we have every right to look out for ourselves. To use our voice to let the market know what we want. To criticize when we think something is bad. But you do have to be realistic, and understand that, not everything can be made to how you 100% want something. That there is another side to all of this. \n\n","aSentId": 35575,"answer": "Honestly - I would definitely buy a game for $2-$3 one shot on mobile if it's an average mobile game (and hell - for that sort of game, I would be fine with having a small advertisement banner at the top or bottom to help with the costs), and up to $5-$10 for an exceptionally good mobile game with no ads. I understand they have to make money - I just find it less than optimal for the end-user the way they do it.  \n\nAs for the gameplay being gimped - I could be wrong, but it looks like this particular game is taking hostage a chunk of your already-existing progress in exchange for an app view - which is just as bad as having to pay to keep playing in my eyes. I don't find it immoral though - there are so many things being done in marketing that are worse, and they have to make money somehow as you said - I just wish they stopped relying on ad revenue and start legitimately selling games.  \n\nThe problem with 'To use our voice to let the market know what we want' on mobile gaming is that 90% of the people already want games like we're suggesting. It's the 10% cash cows that make the market stay as it is - because for every ten people who don't pay and block ads on a game, one of the cash cows is going to spend ludicrous amounts of money (in the order of hundreds of dollars) to keep playing these games.
