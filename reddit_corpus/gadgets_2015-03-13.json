DRAMs are the main memory chips used to store data while the system is running. Virtually everybody, including experts, will tell you that DRAM contents are lost when you turn off the power. But this isn\u2019t so. Our research shows that data in DRAM actually fades out gradually over a period of seconds to minutes, enabling an attacker to read the full contents of memory by cutting power and then rebooting into a malicious operating system.\n\n&gt; Interestingly, if you cool the DRAM chips, for example by spraying inverted cans of \u201ccanned air\u201d dusting spray on them, the chips will retain their contents for much longer.

This robot's purpose is the rapidly make flavors (same stuff as smells save the taste compounds like sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami).  It takes the machine about 20 mins to generate a flavor.\n\nI have seen a smaller model device from anther company that requires the user to load samples of pre-made flavors into it and it can mix a few together to make novel combinations.  The cost to maintain this device is REALLY expensive as flavor compounds are not cheap.  A good quality identifiable flavor will cost anywhere in the ball park of 20-50 dollars a kilogram and with markup it would make inkjet printer ink look like a good idea to wash your car with.  Add to that the volatile compounds most appealing tend to evaporate under normal conditions and even with controls I do not keep them in neat (pure) or compounded more than 6 months.

However, with all those bootleg products floating around out there (some of which are quite convincing), it can often be difficult to tell the real stuff apart from the knock-offs. With the rise of the \u201cpre-loved\u201d handbag market there is a big need for real-time authentication.\n\nEnter Entrupy, a brilliant new portable device that\u2019s designed to instantly authenticate designer bags so that you never have to worry about making the wrong call again. I discovered the business through chatting over on /r/Luxury on Reddit and couldn\u2019t pass up the opportunity to let our readers know about it.\n\n\n\nYou\u2019re probably wondering exactly how a handheld device could instantly carry out such a complicated task, but the answer is surprisingly simple: Entrupy actually takes microscopic photographs of the bag, then compares\u00a0them to over 1,000,000 reference photographs in its database and tells you if it\u2019s authentic or not.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qgzt", "qSentId": 35212, "question": "Razor\u2019s Crazy Cart XL Is The Coolest Go-Cart That You Can Drive As Adults", "aSentId": 35213, "answer": "I really want this :D", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qgzt", "qSentId": 35215, "question": "Kraftwerk - highly innovative portable power plant", "aSentId": 35216, "answer": "I didn't notice what Sub this was and got really excited that Kraftwerk released a new album.
