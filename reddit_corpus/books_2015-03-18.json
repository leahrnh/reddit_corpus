Most men can be fathers, but how many of them will become good fathers or just mediocre fathers or bad fathers? Or women mothers, etc. That depends on a myriad of beliefs and traits and actions. Reviewers bring with them all that they know and all that they have read--or, to be honest, their ignorance and lack of a feel for style and a lack of awareness of the tradition of, say, the novel.\nAnd on top of that they bring their own taste and their own experience. Some of the best reviewers in the last half century have been mainly critics, as with Edmund Wilson and Alfred Kazin, but some of the best reviewers have also been fiction writers themselves, as with John Updike and John Leonard. Sometimes the pure critics write better than the fiction writer reviewers, sometimes not. Virginia Woolf despised Ulysses, for her own reasons. Andre Gide took his turns at knocking Proust. And when Faulkner reviewed Thomas Wolfe, some good things happened, better things than happen in most of Wolfe's fiction itself. \nSo it really depends on the particular circumstances of particular reviewers writing about particular works of fiction. \nAs for the books you mention, I didn't get very far in reading either of them.

Sometimes your mind is on the trip before you go, and still on the trip and settling in a few days after you get back. But that depends on the writer. Anyway there are times when writers lock everything out for a few months or even a year+ because you pretty much have to in order to maintain high levels of concentration and longer daily blocks of uninterrupted time.\n\nInterruptions like SDCC appearances can be the difference in a three month to a year delay on a novel.
