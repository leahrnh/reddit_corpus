Not saying I agree or disagree with her philosophy but she had an extremely different view on whether or not the black people were oppressed by white people. She was a very interesting and intelligent person and I loved her book. Look forward to reading more from her. \n\n[Here](http://www.lewrockwell.com/2002/02/marcus-epstein/black-libertarian-the-story-of-zora-neale-hurston/) is more about her life ","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh4i","qSentId": 7712,"question": "Favorite books about the American Civil Rights movement: February 04 2015","aSentId": 7717,"answer": "Everyone should read The Autobiography of Malcolm X once in their life.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh4i","qSentId": 7712,"question": "Favorite books about the American Civil Rights movement: February 04 2015","aSentId": 7719,"answer": "I dont have anything ready to read on the Civil Rights movement. \n\nBut I did pick up **12 Years a Slave** on my Kindle.

It would work better if they get in contact directly with a member of a university board, which is elected in my parts, or director of xyz department who then takes the responsibility to bird dog the admission. If the recommenders really wanted to seal the deal they would go to the right people, the ones who overlap into their world like a venn diagaram. Otherwise the receiver will end up being someone in an admissions office that doesn't have knowledge of ramifications nor would likely understand what relationship the recommenders has with the institution.

That's a hell of a lot more than could be said of my high school journalism teacher.\n\n&gt;I work in college admissions,\n\nAh. That explains it. Nothing like a college administative sub-assistant to tell you what quality writing is. \n\n&gt; and I read tons of letters from politicians / judges etc. who have nothing concrete to say about the individual for whom they are writing. \n\n\"Politicians /judges\" are a dime a dozen, but that doesn't stop many prestigious schools (e.g. the Air Force Academy) from pretty much requiring letters of recommendation from senators and the like. I take it you don't work for a very prestigious school. \n\nBut, as someone else mentioned, Harper Lee is signified, dignified, and certified as a member of the Western literary canon. Her word, no matter what it is, should mean more than most. From an academic standpoint, it doesn't get much more reputable or prestigious than that. Not that I expect you to understand that. \n\n&gt;Such letters do not help you one bit, and why should they?\n\nTo sum things up:\n\n1. A letter of recommendation depends on more than the content. It depends on a recommender's reputation.\n\n2. Harper Lee has an impeccable reputation by most academic standards. \n\n3. You should be fired. \n\nEDIT: Nice job editing/deleting all of your posts to make up for your bad arguing. Stay classy. ","aSentId": 8812,"answer": "Really, you're not right. As long as the author of the letter is somewhat respectable - a college prof at a decent institution is a good enough - then added prestige of the letter writer really buys you very little extra in terms of impact, effectiveness, and probability of admission. And if there is a whiff of a family connection or something like that involved, the letter will carry very little weight indeed, for obvious reasons. You can complain about that as much as you like, but that is simply the reality of college admissions. I'm not really giving any sort of personal opinion here; I'm simply describing the way things are done. If you think everyone in the entire profession should be fired, then so be it. \n\nAlso, I work for an extremely prestigious school; but I concede that things may work differently at something like the Air Force Academy, which is obviously atypical in many ways. Perhaps there are other schools that are outliers in one way or another, but that doesn't really detract from my main point.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh4i","qSentId": 8813,"question": "Really, you're not right.

Also, another thing is that the rewards of reading something like Anna Karenina are different than, say, Tolkien. With Tolstoy you are looking at the breadth of his portrait of a society and the psychological complexity of his characters, rather than plot, and you need to understand something of Russian society of that era.

This genre, sort of SF romance, is not really one I thought I'd like, but in fact I enjoyed these quite a bit. There's a sort of gentle humorousness in them. And Baker really is an excellent writer. If you can find it in a collection, I highly recommend the novella \"Son Observe the Time.\" As for the  novels themselves, I enjoyed them all up through _The Sons of Heaven_. I have not read _The Empress of Mars_ or _Not Less Than Gods_ but the reviews suggest _Not Less Than Gods_ was written after her illness was affecting her, and might not be up to the same standard. I feel also that the  main story arc was done and didn't really need this book.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh4i","qSentId": 10693,"question": "The Company series by Kage Baker","aSentId": 10696,"answer": "There are some absolutely hysterical scenes in these books.
