Didn't find the prose all that great either. At some point Orwell completely disregards the story and gets into this large plot-dump of fictional history and his views on the political order of the world. \n\nCharacters act as tools to reinforce those views, not as actual humans. Especially O'Brien acts very weird, he could've had Winston arrested and be done with it, but instead acts as some sort of Bond villain and explains how he does everything for power. (very much like villains in Ayn Rand novels, ironically, since they are opposite parts of the spectrum) \n\nI just find the story and message a bit simplistic. The humans are caricatures. The society is divided in the plebs and middle class, and for some reason only the middle class of the Outer Party is monitored and controlled (as if no one of influence or intelligence could be born among \"commons\"). The mind-control through newspeak and hypnosis and so on is interesting, but highly un-scientific. I didn't find it very realistic. Political ideology and threat of violence is far more effective.

Richard Nixon gutted the economic and manufacturing power of the United States, first by abolishing the Bretton Woods System, then by enforcing price controls that decimated the American Farmer; gutted the moral high ground that the United States had maintained in its dealing with communists, by escalating the largely defensive Vietnam War into an ugly mess of adventurism more akin to Imperialist hegemonic wars of the nineteenth century than its original mission of safeguarding the democracy of South Vietnam before abandoning them to the same enemy we'd now needlessly had fought for a over decade, and by validating Communist China's position that Taiwan was merely a province in revolt in order for no reason other to ensure his legacy was that he opened up trade with an economically-closed nation; and he gutted the prestige and destroyed the faith that the American citizen placed in the office of the President. But, above all of those things, foremost among his sins was that when he had said to David Frost, \"When the president does it, that means it's not illegal,\" he was right. He himself set that precedent when Gerald Ford pardoned him, because that meant from 1974 until the destruction of the American state, no president no matter how cruel, lawless, illegal or abhorrent his actions in the face of our Constitution would ever face trial for what he did when he was in office. \n\nThe only President worse the Richard Nixon was Gerald Ford because he pardoned that traitor.","aSentId": 8926,"answer": "Right out of the Communist Party USA playbook ...","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh4i","qSentId": 8927,"question": "Right out of the Communist Party USA playbook ...","aSentId": 8928,"answer": "Exactly, Richard Nixon did more for the advancement of global communism than Khrushchev, Mao, and Lenin combined.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh4i","qSentId": 8929,"question": "Exactly, Richard Nixon did more for the advancement of global communism than Khrushchev, Mao, and Lenin combined.","aSentId": 8930,"answer": " That's an exaggeration.

It's about a wizard detective in Chicago who helps out the Special Investigations unit with supernaturally bent crimes/murders. The first few books are a little iffy, since they were the very first books written by the author, Jim Butcher, but he really gets his act together around the 3rd or 4th book, and then the series grows exponentially better with each new installment. I promise, if you can make it through the first two books (Storm Front and Fool Moon) you will be very nicely rewarded, especially since the (I want to say 7th) book Dead Beat has the most amazing final battle in the history of fantasy.\n\nFor what it's worth, I would recommend one of two different methods of tackling the series. \n\nA) Read the first book (Storm Front) to get a feel for all the characters, but skip the second book (Fool Moon) since it's pretty useless in the story arc and IMO the weakest of all the books\n\nB) Start on the third book (Grave Peril) since this is where the real, huge plot behind the Dresden Files begins and then eventually reread the first two books as flashbacks\n\nThe Dresden Files is a really good series and I would highly recommend reading the books. However, if you don't really enjoy urban fantasy, you can try out Butcher's other series, the Codex Alera, which takes place in a different world called Alera. Butcher took a bet that he couldn't write a book out of two completely different ideas, so he wrote the Codex Alera based on \"Lost Roman Legion + Pokemon\" and completed a full, 6 book series. The Codex Alera is also a really good series, but I personally prefer the Dresden Files.\n\nAnd finally, if you prefer a different style overall, Butcher has started another series called The Cinder Spires (or something to that effect) which is steampunk, with the first book coming out soon called the Aeronaut's Windlass.\n\nSorry for the wall of text\n\ntldr; Dresden Files, Codex Alera, or the (not yet released) Cinder Spires ","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh4i","qSentId": 9054,"question": "nope, but I've been looking for a book","aSentId": 9057,"answer": "I have an interesting relationship with The Dresden Files.

I don't know anyone whose read that series who didn't like it. \n\nThe series is one of those that leaves you wishing there were more adventures with those characters, and you can't really give a book, or set of books higher praise than that.\n\nThe fourth book, the Ring of Solomon is a prequel. Bartimaeus is always boasting about his exploits thousands of years previously meeting various legendary people. The Ring of Solomon is set back in those times.

We all have the ability to use both of these views and IMO, Pirsig was saying that we should not become too attached to one way of thinking because if we do, we're missing out on so much. Missing out on life and all its beauty and tragedy. Phaedrus was Pirsig before he realized this. Phaedrus was Pirsig viewing the world in a completely one sided rational manner, to the point where he became \"insane\", becoming a victim of his own one-sided view of the world. It wasn't until he became \"well\" again (whatever that means), that he saw the error of his ways. I also disagree that Pirsig was schizophrenic.

","aSentId": 10221,"answer": "Thank you for risking unpopularity to be critical.  (Really!)  I can't voice Pirsig's intentions as an author, and I certainly can't *prescribe* any interpretations for any reader.  But I'll happily say what the book meant to me.\n\nFor me, the most influential part of the reading experience isn't Pirsig's discussion of \"quality\".  Nor is it his exploration of scientific method and epistemology.  Nor is it his chilling personal story of mental illness.  I *do* love all of those aspects every time I reread the book, but they're not the most meaningful parts to me.\n\nWhat has stuck with me the most is his treatment of knowledge as a spatial entity.  Knowledge is treated by Pirsig as a landscape of peaks and valleys.  The terrain can be rough or easy going.  It can be well traveled or seldom seen.  Changing by the forces of thinkers themselves, the landscape builds up and erodes over time.  (I'd be happy to find direct quotes that demonstrate each of these sentences, but this post is eating into homework time.)\n\nNumerous times throughout the book, Pirsig uses this intellectual landscape treatment directly as metaphor in narration and dialogue.  But the treatment is deeper than just quotable details - it spans Zen and the Art's entire structure.  The story of his motorcycle/hiking journey with his son is told in parallel with his intellectual journey (comprised of his chautauquas and his past as Phaedrus).  At many points throughout, similarities between those two journeys is absolutely uncanny.  (Again, this is worth essays, but I'm on homework time right now, so here's a taste.)  Each of the following points are an attempt to show just a few similarities between the physical and intellectual landscapes as told by Pirsig: \n\n- As the motorcycle party [traverses the well traveled, low altitude Yellowstone Valley, the reader learns about Phaedrus' relationship to conventional Western thought.](#s)  Both landscapes (physical and intellectual) are well-worn paths of least resistance.\n- While they are at [DeWeese's home, the physical landscape/travel changes from valley highways to mountain passes.  Here, the reader learns of a pivotal moment in Phaedrus' intellectual journey: when a colleague asked if Phaedrus' would be teaching \"quality\" to the students.](#s)  Intellectually and physically, they are now at the edge between a challenging, remote mountain and an agreeable, established valley.\n- As the narrator and his son begin to [ascend the mountain, diverging away from the well traveled paths of civilization, the reader is told of Phaedrus' gradual withdrawal into increasingly unconventional thoughts about quality](#s).  They are travelling where both landscapes begin to rise, and the terrain is no longer navigable by conventional vehicles (Physical vehicle abandoned: [motorcycle](#s).  Intellectual vehicle abondoned: [logical, western modes of thought](#s).)\n- While nearing [the mountain peak, things are isolated and slow going.  The narrator tells his son about rock slide and avalanche risks of the unstable terrain.  Simultaneously, he is telling the reader of Phaedrus' isolating final ascent towards understanding quality, which ultimately destabilized Phaedrus' mind.](#s)  Both landscapes are unstable and untraveled, and both are dangerous because of the long distance to fall before reaching established, populated ground.\n\nTreating ideas and knowledge as a natural, spatial landscape is absolutely fascinating to me.  No book I've read comes close to how much Zen and the Art resonates with me on that subject.  The concept of knowledge as a landscape is woven tightly and pervasively throughout the story.  Regardless of Pirsig's intentions, it's the most fundamental part of how I interpret the story.  Next time I read it, I'll try to keep structured notes so I can better demonstrate what I'm saying.\n\nEDIT: Spoiler delete.\nEDIT2: Concluding remarks.
