The score was also fantastic and arguably my favourite from 2013.\n\nThe acting wasn't great, but it was good. It was enough to make the film work. The characters are likeable and Sandra Bolluck breathing didn't seem to annoy me as much as it seems to have the rest of /r/movies. Stone also had a good character arc, going from someone who just drifted in existence, to someone who learned to accept the roller coaster of life.\n\nI enjoyed the complexity of the problem (someone is stuck in space and everything that can go wrong is going wrong) being juxtaposed with the simplicity of the solution (find your way back home). Straight forward, A to B to C.\n\nAll this with fantastic direction made a movie that held 100% of my attention for the entire run time.

It's very useful if you just want to go to the movies once in a while, it gives you a handfull of choices which that should be interresting no matter what style or genre it is. Metacritic gives an average score of professional reviewers, so they're a bit baiased towards good drama and artsy stuff, and against lowest-common-denominator by-the-numbers stuff, which is nice if you've seen it all and are looking for some less popular stuff. IMDB is a popularity contest, *but*, individual items seems to attract more votes by people who are interrested in that kind of movie / genere, so wheter an old scifi movie is a 5 or a 6 is actually a pretty big difference.\n\nLike any reviewer, every pulication, award, etc, those sites have some pretty specific baiases which you learn to understand the more you compare their judgments to your own. This is not bad. Just like you trust the judgment of a friend with a similar taste than you, you can find reviewers / sites etc that suit your taste.\n\nBut now you throw all that together. What do those numbers even mean now? The wider you cast the net (\"best movies\" vs. \"best scifi movies\"), the less the comparisons mean. If you like romatic comedies, but not scifi, a list that tells you that a scifi movie is 1% better than this romcom doesn't really matter much. Those broad comparisons work for the usecase of RT, and they're useful for comparisons within a genre on MC or IMDB, and of course, the top 100, best of the best, should always be a good watch. But what do you learn from mixing those different systems together that you didn't already know? When spanning so many different things / generes, the exact ranking on those lists is pretty arbitrary to begin with, so mixing those different baiases together just gives you a more arbitrary list. Just look at this thread. People arguing about how something is higher up than something else. They'd do exactly the same if you just give them the IMDB top 250 list.

Generally, what critics consider to be a good movie is not always what the general public considers a good movie. Most people go to the movies to be entertained rather than gain some deeper understanding of the world they live in. If a movie can do both, I would certainly consider it to be great (Probably why Chinatown is my favorite movie). However, critics seem to favor those movies with a deeper meaning while the public is generally more wishywashy on those. \n\nPersonally, I think it is a fool's errand to combine movies of all genres into one master list, but it will happen. For example, movies such as Star Wars and Chinatown are simply not comparable. Both are fantastic movies but are completely different in what they are setting out to accomplish.

If everyone in the world was goddamned amazing at math, getting 80% of the questions on a test might be the average, which would be represented by a 50% score (or 55% as /u/Uphoria suggested, whichever).\n\nSomeone else in this thread said something along the lines of \"7 is the average because there's a lot of movies that come out\".

That adds a lot of immersion and authenticity to the film. It's so mundane and common yet is a big part of this film's genuine nature.\n\nWhat helps it's genuine nature is the crustal references during when it's filmed, like the aforementioned Obama references in 2008. This aids in the character development of Mason Sr who eventually marries into a conservative family. This can e achieved in real time, but there's more authenticity and emotion when you see those items represented properly during their popularity.  \n\nThe first sections of Boyhood definitely had more usage of pop-culture references, but I felt it was pretty seamless. As a kid or even teen, there are probably so many pop-culture references that fade away or become obsolete upon its successor that, like most people, they'd probably forget about all the toys and knick-knacks they had during their childhood, when almost everything they had would've been fairly popular and representative of that year. \n\nGrowing up in the same years Coltrane did, it was not just nostalgic or \"cheap\" to see the pop-cultural references, but quite emotional. A feeling of emptiness seeing so many toys and gadgets that I'd forgotten about. Besides the fact these gadgets are quite good at summarising the year and time period.\n\nIt's like making a 70s movie and then not giving them iconic 70s peripherals - certain hair styles, type of clothing, style of car, technology, media, etc. \n", "aSentId": 2314, "answer": "&gt; What helps it's genuine nature is the crustal references during when it's filmed ...

Metacritic isn't as useful for older movies released before 2000 or so, as many movies aren't listed, and the ones that are often have unusual scores due to there not being that many reviews from back then (RT also has this problem, but to a lesser extent since they use reviews from a much higher number of critics)\n\nEach website has a different way of calculating their scores, and they each have their own flaws.

Are we now saying that positive racism is acceptable? How about keeping everyone held to the same standard? If we are going to bridge the racial divide, we don't do it by making two sets of standards. \n\nTake affirmative action in schools for example. We draw this up on racial lines as opposed to economics. If we targeted poor kids, we would help those who need to be helped regardless of their race. As it is now, it is solely based on race, and is, by definition, racist. Not only that, we are saying \"you need help because the color of your skin\". They don't. They need help because of their current situation of disadvantage. It may be in part to their race, but there are other factors which I would argue are more important: economics, location etc. We should define the need for help based on specific reasons and not blanket racism.\n\nI feel like I am taking crazy pills where the same population that maligns \"black people meet\" and \"BET\" as hypocritical can support a double standard for other scenarios. I am the one person here that cares about equality.\n\nEDIT 2:\n\n\"Tony stark doesn't need to be white, but PoP should be persian\".\n\nI find this amusing. Tony Stark was created as a white character. So it's ok to change his race. PoP was designed persian, so it's NOT ok to change his race? Also, in the film, he was adopted. He wasn't actually a prince of persia.\n\nI have no problem changing the race of a marvel character. I think a lot of people are making assumptions. But I am saying that if it is ok to change the race of a marvel character to try and bring in a different demographic, than it should be ok to do it when it doesn't benefit a minority race.\n\nWhat I can't stand is benevolent racism because it doesn't solve any of the issues we face. Working on the core problems of infrastructure, education, and poverty would organically yield *permanent* results.

Aquaman is half-Hawai'ian. The new *Fantastic Four* film has a black Storm family and Sue is now presumably adopted - and no offence to Kate Mara, but that's fucking stupid, and probably caused by the studio wanting diversity but not to the extent that Reed Richards would be dating a black woman.\n\nConversely, the reason why it's a bad idea to cast a non-white role with a white actor is that it's already ridiculously rare to get a film with, say, a Persian protagonist, so if that guy can't even be Persian, it looks like exactly what it is - a deliberate decision by the studio to cast a white, name-brand actor because they think white people won't go see movies with non-white people in them.\n\nAs if the attraction of a *Prince of Persia* movie is Jake fucking Gyllenhaal and not, you know, the brand of the game or the fantasy action itself.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3s", "qSentId": 4498, "question": "So, to clarify: it is wrong to cast a white guy as a Persian in prince of Persia, but it's ok to make Annie black or change any member of the Avenger's race in the future?\n\nI just want to be clear that I have no problem with changing the race of a character when it makes sense.

Namely, since the title straight up says he's Persian.\n\nIf you cast a black actor to play Winston Churchill, that would obviously be dumb, because there is a specific and good reason why he is supposed to be white.\n\nWhile I'm sure it is well established over many decades that Tony Stark is white, I really don't see why he has to be. It's not central to the story, and doesn't really challenge the suspension of disbelief.\n\nA more appropriate comparison, I believe, would be something like comparing Cyclops and Storm from X-Men. Cyclops is white, and Storm is black, but there really is no reason they *need* to be. The movie adaptations would not have their story substantially altered by a black Cyclops or a white Storm (other than that it is a point of departure from the comics), but those are not equivalent changes.\n\nThe point of people talking about minority representation in film is about how little of it there really is. Taking a white character (like Cyclops) and making him black has a negligible impact on white representation in media. There are still scads of white characters that white audiences can see, and feel some subconscious sense of representation. Making Storm white would have no real impact on the *story*, but it would have a significant impact on black representation because it takes one of the few black characters and gets rid of them (for no good reason).\n\nAnd it does make a difference to people, especially young people, to see people like themselves taking strong roles. There was an interview I once saw Whoppi Goldberg do where she talked about how significant it was for her as a child to watch Star Trek and see Uhura, a black woman, serving as an equal officer instead of as a servant or maid.\n\nRepresentation is getting better, but it is not the same thing to cast a white character with a minority actor as it is the other way around. They have the potential for substantially different social impact, and playing it off as though they are equivalent comes across as disingenuous. It's a double standard because it is only meaningful in one direction.\n\nA black Tony Stark would be a trivial change in the prominence of white characters in popular media, but a meaningful change in the prominence of black characters in popular media.\n\nThere are characters where changing the race from white to a minority race would poorly serve the story (like Thor; being based on a Norse origin suggests he should probably be cast to reflect that), but really, for many characters the impact on the *story* of their race is trivial. It is the *social* impact that changes. ", "aSentId": 4515, "answer": "Tony Stark is a white character. There is no reason the PoP couldn't be white either.

THIS SAME COMMENT HAS GOTTEN 800 LIKES CHECK MY PAGE. I JUST WANT WHITE PEOPLE TO READ IT.\n\n&gt; How can that possibly be good?\n\nHere's why we have affirmative action. Before I even begin it's pretty crazy how many angry white people are in this thread. White privilege does not mean every white person has it easy and that every non white has it hard. It doesn't mean all white people are racists out to hold minorities down. It just means being part of the majority group is usually more beneficial than being a minority in most countries. The white privilege people refer to is based on strictly American population and race demographics. There are always exceptions. I probably had more privilege than some whites since my black parents were/are upper middle class architects. There are poor and disadvantaged white people but it doesn't negate an over all trend of white privilege.\n\nAlso overt personal racism is different than institutionalized racism which is on a macro systematic schale. Any race is capable of racism. I have seen the white and asians bullied when I went to a majority black school. A group needs to dominate an area or be part of the majority to be part of large scale systematic institutionalized racism. This doesn't mean there is group of white men maliciously trying to bar minorities from jobs. Are there white people like that? Yes but they are probably much smaller than the ones who do it unconsciously. The concept of homogeneity dictates that we are more likely to mate with, be friends with, date and give unconscious favoritism to those similar to us. This could be in race, socioeconomic status or hobby. It's a big part of the reason white people usually date other white people. It's not because whites are racist or hate the look of other races. This phenomenon carries over to the job market. Remember whites are 63%(72 if you count white hispanics like those from spain). This is what affirmative action tries to correct for but it's not a perfect law and sometimes hurts white people.\n", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3s", "qSentId": 4800, "question": "Why they even ask for race in job applications still?

The centaurs Bane, Ronan and Magorian burst into the hall with a great clatter of hooves, as behind Harry the door that led to the kitchens was blasted off its hinges.\n\nThe house-elves of Hogwarts swarmed into the entrance hall, screaming and waving carving knives and cleaver, and at their head, the locker of Regulus Black bouncing on his chest, was Kreacher, his bullfrog's voice audible even above this din: \"Fight!

Harry watched with terror and elation as Molly Weasley's wand slashed and twisted, and Bellatrix Lestrange's smile faltered and became a snarl. Jets of light flew from both wands, the floor around the witches' feet became hot and cracked; both woman were fighting to kill.\n\n\"No!\" Mrs. Weasley cried as a few students ran forward, trying to come to her aid. \"Get back! Get back!

Didn't you listen to Ollivander? The wand chooses the wizard... The Elder Wand recognized a new master before Dumbledore died, someone who never even laid a hand on it. The new master removed the wand from Dumbledore against his will, never realizing exactly what he had done, or that the world's most dangerous wand had given him its allegiance...\"\n\nVoldemort's chest rose and fell rapidly, and Harry could feel the curse coming, feel it building inside the wand pointed at his face.\n\n\"The true master of the Elder Wand was Draco Malfoy.\"\n\nBlank shock showed in Voldemort's face for a moment, but then it was gone.\n\n\"But what does it matter?\" he said softly. \"Even if you are right, Potter, it makes no difference to you and me. You no longer have the phoenix wand: We duel on skill alone... and after I have killed you, I can attend to Draco Malfoy...\"\n\n\"But you're too late,\" said Harry. \"You've missed your chance. I got there first. I overpowered Draco weeks ago. I took his wand from him.\"\n\nHarry twitched the hawthorn wand, and he felt the eyes of everyone in the Hall upon it.\n\n\"So it all comes down to this, doesn't it?\" whispered Harry. \"Does the wand in your hand know its last master was Disarmed? Because if it does... I am the true master of the Elder Wand.\"\n\nA red-glow burst suddenly across the enchanted sky above them as an edge of dazzling sun appeared over the sill of the nearest window. The light hit both of their faces at the same time, so that Voldemort's was suddenly a flaming blur. Harry heard the high voice shriek as he too yelled his best hope to the heavens, pointing Draco's wand:\n\n", "aSentId": 8122, "answer": "\"Avada Kedavra!\"\n\n\"Expelliarmus!\"\n\nThe bang was like a cannon blast, and the golden flames that erupted between them, at the dead center of the circle they had been treading, marked the point where the spells collided. Harry saw Voldemort's green jet meet his own spell, saw the Elder Wand fly high, dark against the sunrise, spinning across the enchanted ceiling like the head of Nagini, spinning through the air toward the master it would not kill, who had come to take full possession of it at last. And Harry, with the unerring skill of the Seeker, caught the wand in his free hand as Voldemort fell backward, arms splayed, the slit pupils of the scarlet eyes rolling upward. Tom Riddle hit the floor with a mundane finality, his body feeble and shrunken, the white hands empty, the snakelike face vacant and unknowing. Voldemort was dead, killed by his own rebounding curse, and Harry stood with two wands in his hand, staring down at his enemy's shell.\n\nOne shivering second of silence, the shock of the moment suspended: and then the tumult broke around Harry as the screams and the cheers and the roars of the watchers rent the air. The fierce new sun dazzled the windows as they thundered toward him, and the first to reach him were Ron and Hermione, and it was their arms that were wrapped around him, their incomprehensible shouts that deafened him. Then Ginny, Neville, and Luna were there, and then all the Weasleys and Hagrid, and Kingsley and McGonagall and Flitwick and Sprout, and Harry could not hear a word that anyone was shouting, not tell whose hands were seizing him, pulling him, trying to hug some part of him, hundreds of them pressing in, all of them determined to touch the Boy Who Lived, the reason it was over at last \u00a8C The sun rose steadily over Hogwarts, and the Great Hall blazed with life and light. Harry was an indispensable part of the mingled outpourings of jubilation and mourning, of grief and celebration. They wanted him there with them, their leader and symbol, their savior and their guide, and that he had not slept, that he craved the company of only a few of them, seemed to occur to no one. He must speak to the bereaved, clasp their hands, witness their tears, receive their thanks, hear the news now creeping in from every quarter as the morning drew on; that the Imperiused up and down the country had come back to themselves, that Death Eaters were fleeing or else being captured, that the innocent of Azkaban were being released at that very moment, and that Kingsley Shacklebolt had been named temporary Minister of Magic.\n\nThey moved Voldemort's body and laid it in a chamber off the Hall, away form the bodies of Fred, Tonks, Lupin, Colin Creevey, and fifty others who had died fighting him. McGonagall had replaced the House tables, but nobody was sitting according to House anymore: All were jumbled together, teachers and pupils, ghosts and parents, centaurs and house-elves, and Firenze lay recovering in the corner, and Grawp peered in through a smashed window, and people were throwing food into his laughing mouth. After a while, exhausted and drained, Harry found himself sitting on a bench beside Luna.\n\n\"I'd want some peace and quiet, if it were me,\" she said.\n\n\"I'd love some,\" he replied.\n\n\"I'll distract them all,\" she said. \"Use your cloak.\"\n\nAnd before he could say a word, she had cried, \"Oooh, look, a Blibbering Humdinger!\" and pointed out the window. Everyone who heard looked around, and Harry slid the Cloak up over himself, and got to his feet.\n\nNow he could move through the Hall without interference. He spotted Ginny two tables away; she was sitting with her head on her mother's shoulder: There would be time to talk later, hours and days and maybe years in which to talk. He saw Neville, the sword of Gryffindor lying beside his plate as he ate, surrounded by a knot of fervent admirers. Along the aisle between the tables he walked, and he spotted the three Malfoys, huddled together as though unsure whether or not they were supposed to be there, but nobody was paying them any attention. Everywhere he looked, he saw families reunited, and finally, he saw the two whose company he craved most.\n\n\"It's me,\" he muttered, crouching down between them. \"Will you come with me?\"\n\nThey stood up at once, and together he, Ron and Hermione left the Great Hall. Great chunks were missing from the marble staircase, part of the balustrade gone, and rubble and bloodstains occurred ever few steps as their climbed.\n\nSomewhere in the distance they could hear Peeves zooming through the corridors singing a victory song of his own composition:\n\nWe did it, we bashed them, wee Potter's the one, \n\nAnd Voldy's gone moldy, so now let's have fun!\n\n\"Really gives a feeling for the scope and tragedy of the thing, doesn't it?\" said Ron, pushing open a door to let Harry and Hermione through.\n\nHappiness would come, Harry though, but at the moment it was muffled by exhaustion, and the pain of losing Fred and Lupin and Tonks pierced him like a physical wound every few steps. Most of all he felt the most stupendous relief, and a longing to sleep. But first he owed an explanation to Ron and Hermione, who had stuck with him for so long, and who deserved the truth. \n\nPainstakingly he recounted what he had seem in the Pensieve and what had happened in the forest, and they had not even begun to express all their shock and amazement, when at last they arrived at the place to which they had been walking, though none of them had mentioned their destination.\n", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3s", "qSentId": 8079, "question": "I just remember being disappointed about it compared to Part 1, but then again, I'm way biased because I feel like I was constantly comparing it to the book (the last two were the only ones I watched AFTER reading the book).
