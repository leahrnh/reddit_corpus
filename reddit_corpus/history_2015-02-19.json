Everyone in the tribe is now afraid that looking in the dark pool can make you sick. Are they right? They have very little information, time and resources. They have to get over this and learn from this so they can go back to survival work like hunting and fishing. So they do the best they can; something about the pool made him sick. What in the pool? I don't know, something we couldn't see. Something we don't understand. The imagination runs wild.

Take your human body, for example.\n\nEarth: Food.

The army basically focused on training, training of allies and readiness to deploy in places like Eastern Europe.  \n\nNavies without nuclear submarines were focused on watching enemy aircraft, submarine and ship movements, as well as the regular duties of border security, environmental monitoring, aid to shipping and anti-trafficking operations.  Ships provide a good off-shore platform for radar, and this was important for extending the view of a country offshore.  \n\nThose with nuclear submarines had the added duties of doing the things that nuclear submarines are good for, mainly parking medium-range nuclear weapons out of reach of ICBMS to provide a credible second-strike in the event of a sneak-attack.  Nuclear submarines are also excellent tools for espionage, being able to sneak up to a coastline and drop a team of soldiers covertly.  Sometimes a nuke boat would get into trouble, often by accidentally running into something or due to poor build quality of key components and a rescue or salvage operation would have to be mounted.  The US Navy had a submarine with wheels on it so they could drive along the ocean floor and recover lost materiel.  The CIA also developed a massive ship to pick up an early Russian nuclear boat off the ocean floor and hoist it into the hold, but its mission was only a partial success.\n\nMostly, a Cold War submariner's life was about being on patrol.  You wait in a designated area, praying that you do not receive the command to launch your nuclear weapons and performing drills for all the various things that can happen: on-board fire, munition explosion, nuclear launch, torpedo launch, countermeasures, silent running, etc.  You spend your life keeping the boat running and dealing with whatever failures may occur.  The other thing you do is follow enemy submarines around.  Either you found them or you had intelligence tell you to pick up a track at a time and place.  The idea is to tail them closely so you hear them and they don't hear you.  Russian subs were noisier than American subs, so they often behaved as if they knew they were being followed.  They would perform a maneuvre known as \"Angry Ivan\" in which the boat is turned 180 degrees as quickly as possible and then run back along its course at top speed.  This was intended to discourage following, as any submariner would fear collision.\n\nThe air force game was by far the most complex.  Ultimately, nuclear war is an airman's game.  A lot of the USAF was stationed in the midwest manning MinuteMan ICBM silos.  Their lives were incredibly boring and they also did drills to practice launches and \"button up.\"  In the earlier days of the Cold War, the USAF kept a huge number of bombers loaded with nuclear bombs in the air at all times, on station near the edge of Russian airspace.  These were gruelling missions and everyone spent every damn minute hoping the order to do what they were trained to do would never come.  The bomber fleet took a lot of support, logistics and maintenance, so a lot of soldiers would have had days of just fuelling planes and loading munitions.  If it weren't for the nuclear bombs, it could be as mundane as any other job.  My step-father was an F-104 aircraft mechanic, did a tour in Germany, and he said things were pretty regular, except sometimes that bastard of a  plane would kill its pilot during some training.\n\nThe air force had command of the radar stations that watched for enemy aircraft, escalated suspicious contacts up the chain of command and ultimately scrambled fighter intercepts of bombers or could have triggered the launch of ICBMs.  This system was complex and involved a huge number of people: controllers, \"weapons\" techs, radar techs, cafeteria workers, bureaucrats and software developers.  The front-line, airborne and seaborne stations all fed their data to command-and-control bunkers located in places like Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado and North Bay, Ontario where people stared at the blips and used charming 1970's and 1980's computers to label, tag and escalate.  Russian aircraft made frequent sorties into NATO airspace to test our resolve, perform reconaissance, waste our resources and generally rattle the sabres.  We would have to send a pilot in an aircraft, armed, to identify the aircraft, establish contact and attempt to escort it out of our airspace.  Having to fire on the enemy could easily be a suicide mission (lookup: Nike Rocket).  Often, the Russian pilots and NATO pilots were friendly, exchanging waves and playing little games to keep the political officer busy.\n\nSo your day might be to take an arcane document and turn it into a program to process radar data.  You might spend your day in a frigid radar post, re-wiring a cantakerous radar antenna.  You might push paper at a desk, or spend your time underground watching green blips on round screens.  A fighter pilot might spend half his time sitting around, ready to go flying at a moment's notice, and the other half training on his aircraft.  Stuff like that.  Boring.  Intensely boring.  Intensely frightening.  Numbing.\n\nOn top of this, the Air Force had a few regular duties, like flying Nimrod aircraft around the sea borders looking for smugglers or submarines, search-and-rescue, that sort of stuff.\n\nIntelligence was a huge game and mostly involved the Navy, Air Force and CIA (KGB, CSIS, MI6 or what-have-you).  The KGB was very good at getting people into The West where they could get jobs in important industries or goverment bureaucracies and snag a few documents.  Everything was worth watching: the news, the weather, the next aircraft, the next submarine, the capabilities of various weapons and systems.  Some spies just waited for orders and went about living as normal and boring a life as possible.  It was easy for the KGB to penetrate our open societies.  Trying to get a Westerner into Russia was nearly impossible, however.  Their society was closed, their people genuinely afraid of capitalists and genuinely afraid of what would happen to them if they did not report a stranger in town.  The Russians had many moles inside Western intelligence agencies.  Most spies sent into Russia were picked up quickly and killed slowly.  Attempts to sniff-out moles went poorly and we know a few got away.\n\nSomeone had to operate the \"number stations\" that broadcast encoded messages to overseas spies.  Someone had to receive those transmissions and yet others had to turn them into intelligence reports for the Politburo who would sit around discussing the most inflated of them, taking ridiculous decisions.\n\nOn the NATO side, it was all about SIGINT (signals intelligence).  There were stations all around Russia, from CFB Alert, to Germany, to Japan we listened to anything we could pick up over the radio waves.  People went to their office jobs every day, operated the equipment and filed their reports.  Boring.  The US Navy dropped microphones at the bottom of the sea so they could listen to the Russian submarine fleet and someone had to develop the systems and software and yet others had to maintain it and yet others had to listen to the sonar and file reports every day.  Lots of reports.  Reports went to your higher-ups who produced more reports for their higher-ups.\n\nOther nerds pored over satellite pictures and produced their reports.  Yet other nerds pored over pictures taken from the SR-71 or the U-2 aircraft and made more reports.  Those groups probably did not speak to each other: only their bosses had clearance to see both sources.  Those bosses produced a report that went to still higher officials.  A picture of a dozen aircraft on a single airfield once convinced the US that Russia had more bombers than they and so the US had to step up production.  Nothing could be further from the truth: that picture turned out to be the entire Russian fleet.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh53", "qSentId": 38293, "question": "What did soldiers in the first world countries actually do during the cold war?", "aSentId": 38310, "answer": "There's an excellent British TV show about this period, called \"Soldier, Soldier.\" I thought it accurately captured the daily frustrations of army life. I asked some Brits about it, and they said that it was as accurate as TV could make it, with the understood limitations. \n\nUS Army tactical intelligence '82-'07. Most US troops were in the states, with huge depots of equipment in Europe and Korea. Over 100k US in Europe, mostly (four divisions+) in Germany, plus the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) up north, with huge depots of additional vehicles and equipment. Major, month-long yearly exercises that seemed to me to be 30% combat training and 70% the logistics of getting forces from elsewhere to the country where the war would be. \n\nI worked with the Brits often, and I believe that their lives (other than rotations to Ulster) were similar to ours. 50% of my time was spent in maintenance of equipment, mostly vehicles and radios built by the lowest bidder (our equipment could have been better but the British stuff was rubbish, and required more maintenance). In Europe, we spent most of our time on small bases with little space or facilities for training, scattered around Germany; in the US forces were (are) grouped together on mega-bases (same in Britain, I think) with big training areas and shooting ranges. \n\nSpeaking in very general terms, combat troops would spend a week on field exercises (maneuvers), then three weeks on maintaining and cleaning their vehicles and equipment, then another week doing meaningless \"housekeeping\" duties, such as mowing laws, painting buildings, and attending mandatory but tangential training (STD prevention, equal opportunity, law of war).  Meaningful training had to accommodate these realities. Some commanders and their units took everything very seriously, others more stoically. Our discipline was relatively high because the US draft (conscription) had ended in 1975 (UK National Service ended much earlier, but I don't know when), and anti-drunk driving rules and drug urine-testing came in about this time; am I correct in thinking that these factors were similar in HM Forces? Everyone was a volunteer, and non-violent troublemakers were just discharged (fired).

In Europe, we spent most of our time on small bases with little space or facilities for training, scattered around Germany; in the US forces were (are) grouped together on mega-bases (same in Britain, I think) with big training areas and shooting ranges. \n\nSpeaking in very general terms, combat troops would spend a week on field exercises (maneuvers), then three weeks on maintaining and cleaning their vehicles and equipment, then another week doing meaningless \"housekeeping\" duties, such as mowing laws, painting buildings, and attending mandatory but tangential training (STD prevention, equal opportunity, law of war).  Meaningful training had to accommodate these realities. Some commanders and their units took everything very seriously, others more stoically. Our discipline was relatively high because the US draft (conscription) had ended in 1975 (UK National Service ended much earlier, but I don't know when), and anti-drunk driving rules and drug urine-testing came in about this time; am I correct in thinking that these factors were similar in HM Forces?

Melting the coins into one fat lumpy hunk (or smaller pieces and selling over time) and selling for scrap is the quickest way to turn that lucky find into cash or big numbers on an ATM screen.  Finder gets: Big benefit. Society: not so much. Risk? Low.  Time investment? Low.\n\n2. Keeping the coins intact, and putting out feelers to people you know who you think would know people who would know people who wanted to trade their cash or numbers on an ATM screen into priceless antique GOLD FRIGGING COINS they get to show their jerk-off buddies who might have a white tiger rug and a live cheetah but does that schmuck have ancient frigging gold frigging coins?  Finder gets: potentially big benefit. Society: not so much. Risk? High, since those people are gray-to-black-market anyways and will certainly know more ways to scam or harm you than vice-versa. Time investment: long.\n\n3. Turn the coins into the authorities.  Society gets: big benefit. Finder? Not so much (or in this case basically NOTHING). Risk? low, other than potentially spiraling into depression over getting $0 for a multi-million-dollar-or-possibly-priceless haul.  Time investment? So quick you barely see the stack of priceless coins leaving the room.\n\nIn this case it's \"just some gold coins\" but the pattern is everywhere.  The looting of Baghdad after US Shock and Awe.  Looting of Egyptian tombs by number and volume likely dwarf \"legitimate archaeology\".  The blood diamond mining systems in Africa. The gold mining child-labor-supported systems in too many countries to count.

But many antiquities have already been stolen from other countries or may be the cultural heritage of some other important group, and you could argue it does the public a better service to have that antiquity returned to its rightful place.

The war was complex indeed you had French who supported the independence of Algeria and for a lot it cost their lives. Rival factions of the FLN who were pro independence yet waged war against the FLN. Algerians who collaborated with France and some them were paradoxically still pro independence yet didn't like the FLN. You had true collaborators, Algerians in the French army who actively fought independence. You had the OAS who rebelled against De Gaulle authority. Before the OAS the whole French Army with the support of the settlers sought to make a coup against De Gaulle and replace him... Still all these nuances don't change big narrative: The vast majority of the people who were pro independence were Algerians and they waged the war against France, on the other side the vast majority who were against independence were the French until they were forced onto it. It is still a war between France and Algeria.\n\n2. The French settlers weren't driven out violently. There was no clear intention for them to leave during he summer of 1962  on the part of the Algerians and the FLN, and the Accords D'Evian explicitly expected them to stay. Nor the FLN nor France actually wanted them to leave. What happened is the French army left en masse in a month or two and left the country in deep insecurity. On the other hand the ALN (within algeria not the borders) could hardly have the numbers and means to make security and the FLN who was abroad could hardly have a decisive authoritative effect from abroad and control the situation. Add to that the OAS who intensified desperate terrorist operations which killed Europeans too and sought to reignite the war, french intelligence services who tried to counteract the OAS and you had a big chaos that saw various massacres. Still I like to think the Massacre at Oran was mostly an isolated case as far as Europeans were concerned. The rest of the country didn't witness a violence of the same magnitude and the order soon was re established. Out of 1 million of pied noirs, 200k still stayed in Algeria and left way later.

Both by the church and many dukes, counts etc., who wanted to pass on their fiefdoms to their offspring, not have the emperor give it to someone else.  \n\n&gt;was it viewed as a single entity in \"international\" affairs?\n\nOriginally, the Empire would conduct foreign policy and make agreements with other countries.

They did not reign over the empire like a democratic president nowadays would, but they rather had the job to keep the whole empire stable.\n\nAs you correctly mentioned the lieges often fought against each other. It was the emperors task to stop this but he often was not mighty enough or did not have the interest to stop certain conflicts.\n\nWhich obligations did the princes have ? Not the same to all times. Often taxation in later times, some times they had to send their armies to help their lord emperor, but as mentioned those rights were not respected to the same extent at all times.\n\nIt was not a European Union kind of thing. Some historians like to see it as quite a similar thing, but in theory the Holy Roman Empire hat one lord and was not a cluster of nations. In the Holy Roman Empire, a small city could be its own nation per rights, with the Kaiser as its only lord.\n\nWas it and entity in international affairs ?\n\nNot really.

You will have many contracts signed by small free towns within the empire  with lets say a duchery without the empire being part of it, there are a lot of treaties between foreign kingdoms and lord within the empire.\n\nI recently worked with a document from the late middle ages, where the Doge of Venice wrote a letter to a free german city because Venice had trouble with a german merchant.\n\nOne would not contact the emperor therefore the Empire with such stuff, but contact the city or duchery or kingdom directly.\n\nThe mightier a monarch or city in the empire, the more they handled foreign affairs on their own.\n", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh53", "qSentId": 38644, "question": "What was the role of the Holy Roman Empire?", "aSentId": 38649, "answer": "Being German Hospitaliers acting like Romans.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh53", "qSentId": 38651, "question": "Declaring war", "aSentId": 38652, "answer": "War was declared through diplomacy and soldiers.

In the late Middle Ages, negotiators would shuttle back and forth between capitols, and an official declaration was delivered, after which the ruling classes mobilized their forces and moved into the theater of war (the land area where the fighting would take place). When armies met each other, there would be a battle during which (I'm not making this up) neutral observers (heralds) from both sides would declare a winner at the end of the day. Rich captives (noblemen) would be ransomed, and captured soldiers would either be slaughtered or exchanged (or sometimes recruited). Post-game diplomacy recorded what land or resources changed hands (Henry V got lands and married the French princess). \n\nLater on, the same precombat niceties were exchanged, and battles would be decided by who \"held the field\" at the end of the day. Very few battle lasted more than a day, and most armies were in the low thousands or even hundreds. Muskets generally didn't have sights until the American Civil War, because the point was to volley back and forth to crush your enemy's resolve, then charge with bayonets to force them to run (there were seven bayonet wounds for every bullet wound in the American Revolution). There were similar (not identical) conventions some Asian countries; war was business, preserve the noble classes, get it over with in short order. There were many exceptions where war was not declared (see Royal Navy vs Copenhagen). \n\nThis was only in formal war during this period. Prior to this, your first clue that that the Goths or Romans or Mongols wanted your land was sometimes when a thousand of them showed up on your doorstep. Caesar gloatingly claimed to have killed hundreds of thousands of Gauls, enslaved many of the survivors, and populated the land with Roman settlers. Whether you declared war or just invaded depended on whether your opponent was in some sense a \"peer.\" European nations (or Japanese clans) might go through the formalities, but it \"uncivilized\" groups, religious or ethnic minorities were fair game. The rules only  applied to the Players, and they Players decided who was allowed in their league.\n\nNowadays we have replaced declarations with diplomacy. You deliver demands, gather international or local support, set a timeline, then claim your enemy has failed to meet your reasonable demands and hammer away.

If you want examples of varying perspectives and actions in the immediate wake of the war and the onset of Reconstruction, then Schurz's report to Washington (pub. Dec. 1865) contains a multitude of primary accounts from military staff and the various branches of the Freedman's Bureau throughout the South.\n\n&gt;Some southerners were sympathetic to the plight of poor blacks especially the subsistence farmers and they were often the most anti-war southerners.

It's certainly not the most nuanced thing I've ever written, but I'll stand by it.\n\n&gt; In that sentence you are ignoring the slavery existent in the North\n\nI don't deny it, and in another comment I've affirmed that it existed in the Union. Whether it existed in the 'North' depends on who you ask, and where it was allowed in states that abolished slavery it was the predominantly the result of laws that Southerners favored.\n\n&gt;casting slavery and cruelty as a southern cultural issue,\n\nThey did all they could to make it clear that they wanted to see slavery continue and expand. I haven't done much in that regard. Obviously it's not a matter of everyone South of Maryland's northern border favoring slavery and everyone to its North favoring the geographic limitation or abolition of slavery. Nor is support for slavery irreconcilable with unionism, or vice versa. In fact I'd say that William Freehling's *The South vs. the South* and various examples like Lysander Spooner (abolitionist who held views sympathetic to secessionism) or Union General George Thomas (a slaveowner) very much demonstrate this.\n\n&gt;and saying that Southerners are as a group responsible for being invaded and much of their property being destroyed so that the Northerners could achieve their goal of relieving suffering.\n\n&gt;Perhaps you should reexamine your assumptions because I see a lot of bias and supposition.\n\nI see irony.\n\nI'll be as frank about my biases as you wish me to be, I just need to know just where the other of my biases conflicts with facts and and a more impartial interpretation. You haven't been specific and you haven't sourced anything, so I don't really have much to go off of.\n\n&gt;I just can't help but see a lionization of the North in many war narratives, your words included, and that is a bad thing.\n\nYes, it's a bad thing. Luckily I haven't done that, I've only said that by and large Southerners were fighting for slavery, often because of their own interests in the institution, but also because that was the central cause of the Confederate states' decisions to secede and struggle for their separation. This isn't equatable to the official Union causes, which were to restore the Union and, with the progression of the war, to emancipate the slaves\u2014also varying by person, though with the progression of Union policy any devotion to the former essentially meant the latter (though I wouldn't say total abolition was an *inevitable* outcome of the war). We can't then say that any cause that intends to secure and expand slavery is equally flawed as another cause that opposes that, by virtue of these details alone. Sure, that's an unempirical claim, but so is your statement that both sides of the conflict were equally flawed.\n\n&gt;Both sides were flawed and self interested, and the lines on the map had nothing to do with who was 'right', 'just', or 'noble'.\n\nI've stated on multiple occasions that there was no absolute territorial divide, so you're just reiterating a point I've already responded to with no new content. No conflict is as black-and-white as that, and nobody in their right mind would deny this. But your insistence that we have no business generalizing the conflict makes no sense, and only detracts from our ability to gain much insight into it.\n\n&gt;As an addendum I saw that you characterize the south's goals in the war with your moral judgement of \"more wrong\". Which is interesting because it is a moral judgement and it should be rather questionable considering the early part of the war expressly not about abolition or the later romanticized views.\n\nDepends. Some in the North saw the role of slavery in the conflict from the very beginning, and framed it as such from the onset or from early on into the war. Some were ambivalent, saw the utility of certain policies that were anti-slavery in effect without necessitating emancipation/abolition as an official cause (e.g. Butler's refusal early in the war to return fugitive slaves, which was approved by the War Department). Others until the very end opposed any action on slavery. Lincoln straddled these two factions throughout the war, but we still can't then deny that the issue of slavery was central to the Union cause throughout, as these very tensions that the slavery issue caused factored immensely into policies put forth by Lincoln's administration.\n\n&gt;Establishing a \"more wrong\" in this is just a moral judgement and sir, my moral judgements are just as valid as yours.\n\nYour moral judgements are invalid if you claim that the Southern objective to preserve and expand slavery by securing independence, policy that allowed murder of POWs on the basis of their race, and the use of slave labor in military support roles are all equally 'wrong' as war policies that aimed to destroy targets that contributed to the enemy's ability to make war yet expressly prohibited wanton destruction of civilian property and livelihoods while adopting emancipation of slaves for strategic purposes (among other purposes). That's just a comparison of official policies from either side, and I'll be the first to admit that Sherman's orders were not universally enforced. No army in that war exercised total discipline, and neither side's leadership could or did enforce their policies to maximum uniformity. If you're under the impression that Sherman turned a blind eye while his armies razed everything in their path, I encourage you to read up on the Savannah and Carolina Campaigns as well as Union war policy as a whole, as you're promoting a hugely problematic account that was born of the Lost Cause mythology after the war. Grimsley's *The Hard Hand of War* might be a good place to start.\n\n---\n\nAgain, you've reiterated several times that lionizing the North isn't a good perspective on the history of the ACW, and I've agreed with you *every single time*. Where I've opposed you is in your uncritical statements on the Confederate causes, and your unwillingness/inability (I hope the former) to substantiate your claims by providing examples and analyzing them.", "corpus": "reddit"}]
