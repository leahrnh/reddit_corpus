The Brilliance of the Culture Series is that Banks writes each one from the perspective of different entities the Culture touches- He never tells you that. It's a subtle realization you have after reading a few of the books, but once I realized it, I was HOOKED.  One of the books deals with the Culture espionage branch (Special Circumstances,) one with a mercenary working for them, one with a civilization that doesn't even realize the Culture exists or affects them. There is even a novel of the life of the ships - talking to each other.  While each has its own fascinating plot, when you read them all, you come to understand the Culture and the events that have scarred, formed, and shaped them as a people.  Banks himself is also asking some pretty cool and relevant political and ethical questions.\n\nPlayer of Games is the one I'd recommend you start with.  It's the one that was first given to me.  I'd be happy to pay it forward and mail you a copy if you send me a mailing address, but no pressure.  I am just happy you want to read them, and are willing to give them a chance despite the gross Hell scenes in Surface Detail.  Let me know. :-)\n\nJust an FYI- I also up-voted Patrick Rothfuss's 'Kingkiller Chronicles' in this thread.  His writing is so very beautiful, and the first two books in the series are amazing.

Mikkelsen's performance is so subtle and gut-wrenching and we watch everything he's ever loved taken away from him, and see how quickly and brutally the people of his small town turn against him.\n\nI keep coming back to the word \"devastating\", because as events progress in the film, everyone you watch it with will be covering their faces in horror at what this almost saintly man endures. The film's been compared to \"The Crucible\" and rightly so. Mikkelsen's understated performance is the key to the whole thing - I don't think any of us knows how we would react if such a horrifying accusation were made against us, but on some level he always believes the people who have known him all their lives will come to their senses and realize he's simply not capable of such a monstrous act.\n\nHow do you defend yourself against such an accusation? Anything you say or do will be viewed as further evidence of guilt, and once it's out there, there will be people who always believe you're guilty.\n\nThe little girl in the story, Klara, does a wonderful job as well...it's easy to see how her hurt feelings and the coaching of the adults in her life began this nightmarish chain of events. We don't want to believe children ever lie or manipulate or seek revenge, but of course they do.

I don't think the ridiculous odds of all of Juror 8's claims being correct we're discussed at all. In fact, no counter arguments beyond ad-hominem and sheer race/classism were brought up at all and seemingly all points made for the defense were accepted at point value.\n\nThe best example of this would be the stab wound. Despite the fact that forensics determined the fatal wound was given by someone the height of the defendant with the same exact knife he picked up that day, this evidence was thrown out the window. Why? Because one of the jurors claimed that the defendant would probably attack with the knife in a different way. There was no evidence of this, as I said, the knife had been in that man's possession for a day. However, due to the fact that the defendant was a Latino boy from the slums, the assumption was made that he would automatically know the proper way to wield a switch blade.\n\nIs this possible? Entirely, however each time we were asked to make a leap of faith like that the case became less and less bulletproof. \n\nThe jurors who were for voting guilty retorted to this claim by saying something racist, and then accepting the claim of a juror who has never met this boy as fact. And this happened with every single piece if evidence.\n\nHad there been a single juror in that room capable of saying anything besides \"you've got SOME NERVE\" or \"why I oughta\" that movie would have turned out entirely differently.

Being able to edit is great: everyone wants to write, direct, act, etc. and having the technical skill to edit as well makes you valuable to a film group, and gives you a lot of control over the vision.\n\nIf your school has an amazing film program that's focused on production, it could be a good route, but the skills you learn and the people you meet will be more important than the degree you get, and unless it's a super bad-ass specialized program, you can probably learn those skills outside of the degree, and meet those people through a film minor or an extra-curricular. For screenwriting, I enjoyed the classes and they got me to write regularly, but they didn't teach me any more than I would have learned by joining a writers group and staying diligent.\n\nGeneral advice: take a mix of classes you're interested in, and classes that teach you something you can apply in the real world. A liberal arts degree doesn't mean much beyond you having a Bachelors, a degree in business or the sciences might.

You may *want* to, but once you've been exposed to enough music, you will, inevitably, find something you don't like. I guarantee it.\n\nWhen I used to train DJs, I had to start by screening applicants. One of the questions on the application was, \"What kind of music do you like?\" We didn't actually care. The point of the question was to screen out people with problem attitudes. People who said, \"I like everything!\" went to the bottom of the pile, because based on our experience, that kind of naivete doesn't play well in a place with 60,000 tiles on the shelves. It's an expression of hopeful exuberance, which is commendable for its intentions, but it's like a guy showing up at firehouse saying, \"I like fire trucks!\" It doesn't work well in reality. If you can't discern what you like and don't like, then you basically have no taste. And honestly, the vast majority of *all* music is pretty much disposable.  Even the artists themselves will admit that, privately.\n\nIt's all well and good to be positive. The world needs positive people. And FSM knows, we can always use more people who are more open-minded about music and art.

I started my own music collection at age four, and I've been involved with radio since '87 and also worked for a record label and with a couple clubs. Absolutely no one who's had that much exposure will say they like everything, because it's just not true. You may *want* to, but once you've been exposed to enough music, you will, inevitably, find something you don't like. I guarantee it.\n\nWhen I used to train DJs, I had to start by screening applicants. One of the questions on the application was, \"What kind of music do you like?\" We didn't actually care. The point of the question was to screen out people with problem attitudes. People who said, \"I like everything!\" went to the bottom of the pile, because based on our experience, that kind of naivete doesn't play well in a place with 60,000 tiles on the shelves. It's an expression of hopeful exuberance, which is commendable for its intentions, but it's like a guy showing up at firehouse saying, \"I like fire trucks!\" It doesn't work well in reality. If you can't discern what you like and don't like, then you basically have no taste. And honestly, the vast majority of *all* music is pretty much disposable.  Even the artists themselves will admit that, privately.\n\nIt's all well and good to be positive. The world needs positive people.
