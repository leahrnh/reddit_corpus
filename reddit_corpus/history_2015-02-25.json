During the 14th century, an extremely capable Prince of Moscow, Ivan I, was given the authority by his Mongol masters to collect taxes on their behalf from all the Russian states.  That set the course for Moscow becoming the dominant Russian state.  Moscow expanded.  As it did so, Ivan implemented a policy of exiling the elites of each newly-conquered state, and replacing them with his own people.  It became standard policy for the Tsars.  Stalin refined it, Putin is playing around with new forms.\n\nSome of these tendencies can be seen in the histories of other nations too. What makes Russia different is the lack of historical restraints.  Two come to my mind.  Firstly, the Russian Church has always been subservient to the Tsars.  Even today, the church does Putin's bidding.  Secondly, the Enlightenment, which is the source of the Western liberal democratic traditions, never happened in Russia (try googling 'enlightenment in Russia'!). Its influence got as far as the eastern border of Poland - which explains much of what is happening in Ukraine today.  The western half of Ukraine was part of Poland for hundreds of years.
