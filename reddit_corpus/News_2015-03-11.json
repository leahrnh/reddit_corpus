The FDA later announced it had found more deficiencies. The following year Schering agreed to pay $500 million in penalties to the federal government to settle charges relating to manufacturing violations at four plants dating back as far as 1998.\"\n\n\"In 2001 press reports began to appear suggesting that Merck\u2019s heavily promoted arthritis drug Vioxx (and a similar drug made by Pharmacia) might not be as safe as they were initially believed to be. In 2004 Merck withdrew Vioxx from the market after being notified that users were found to have an elevated risk of heart attack or stroke. Several weeks later, the Wall Street Journal, which had obtained internal company e-mails and documents, reported the Merck management appeared to have known about the risks of Vioxx for years and maneuvered to keep the information from derailing its blockbuster product.\n\nA New York Times expos\u00e9 suggested that Merck executives had deliberately taken as long as possible in addressing Vioxx safety problems. The Times went on to report that, nearly a year before Merck management had received the results of the clinical trial that it said prompted the recall, the company had received preliminary results of a separate study indicating the cardiovascular problem. And yet later, the Times reported that, contrary to statements made by Merck, the company had cancelled plans for a clinical trial of its own back in 2002. \n\nSoon the company was facing investigations by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission along with thousands of lawsuits. As these pressures mounted, CEO Raymond Gilmartin resigned. In the first of those individual lawsuits to go to trial, a jury in Texas took just one hour of deliberation in 2005 to decide against the company and award $253 million in damages. In subsequent trials, Merck won some and lost others. In 2007 the company agreed to pay $4.85 billion to settle the remaining 27,000 lawsuits.\"\n\n\"In 2008 Merck agreed to pay the federal government more than $650 million to settle charges that the company routinely overbilled Medicaid and other government programs and made illegal payments to healthcare professionals to induce them to prescribe its products.\n\nIn December 2011 the Massachusetts attorney general announced that Merck would pay $24 million as its part of a $47 million settlement reached with 13 drugmakers to resolve allegations that they overcharged the state\u2019s Medicaid program.\n\nIn 2012 the Louisiana attorney general announced that Merck and four other companies would pay a total of $25.2 million to resolve allegations that they overcharged the state\u2019s Medicaid program.\"\n\nhttp://www.corp-research.org/pfizer\n\n\"During the mid-1980s, watchdog organizations such as the Public Citizen Health Research Group charged that Pfizer\u2019s widely prescribed arthritis drug Feldene created a high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding among the elderly, but the federal government, despite reports of scores of fatalities, declined to put restrictions on the medication. A June 1986 article in The Progressive about Feldene was headlined DEATH BY PRESCRIPTION.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration expressed greater concern about reports of dozens of fatalities linked to heart valves made by Pfizer\u2019s Shiley division. In 1986, as the death toll reached 125, Pfizer ended production of all models of the valves. Yet by that point they were implanted in tens of thousands of people, who worried that the devices could fracture and fail at any moment.\"\n\n\"In 2004, in the wake of revelations about dangerous side effects of Merck\u2019s painkiller Vioxx, Pfizer agreed to suspend television advertising for a related medication called Celebrex. The following year, Pfizer admitted that a 1999 clinical trial found that elderly patients taking Celebrex had a greatly elevated risk of heart problems.\n\nIn 2005 Pfizer withdrew another painkiller, Bextra, from the market after the FDA mandated a \u201cblack box\u201d warning about the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal risks of the medication. In 2008 Pfizer announced that it was setting aside $894 million to settle the lawsuits that had been filed in connection with Bextra and Celebrex.\n\nWith the acquisition of Wyeth (formerly American Home Products) in October 2009, Pfizer took on a new set of legal problems. The summary of legal proceedings in Wyeth\u2019s last annual financial report before the deal was announced went on for 14 pages. Most of the lawsuits discussed were product liability cases involving hormone therapy, childhood vaccines, the anti-depressant Effexor, the contraceptive Norplant and, most importantly, the combination diet drug known as fen-phen, which had been withdrawn from the market after reports that its use was linked to possibly fatal heart valve damage. Those findings unleashed a wave of tens of thousands of lawsuits against the company.\"\n\n\"In 1991 Pfizer agreed to pay $3.1 million to settle EPA charges that the company seriously damaged the Delaware River by failing to install pollution-control equipment at one of its plants in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 1994 Pfizer agreed to pay $1.5 million as part of a consent decree with the EPA in connection with its dumping at a toxic waste site in Rhode Island.\n\nIn 1998 Pfizer agreed to pay a civil penalty of $625,000 for environmental violations discovered at its research facilities in Groton, Connecticut.\n\nIn 2002 New Jersey fined Pfizer fined $538,000 for failing to properly monitor wastewater discharged from its plant in Parsippany.\n\nIn 2003, shortly after Pfizer acquired Pharmacia, the company (along with Solutia and Monsanto) agreed to pay some $700 million to settle a lawsuit over the dumping of PCBs in Anniston, Alabama.\n\nIn 2005 Pfizer agreed to pay $22,500 to settle EPA claims that the company failed to properly notify state and federal officials of a 2002 chemical release from its plant in Groton that seriously injured several employees and necessitated a major emergency response.\n\nAlso in 2005, Pfizer agreed to pay $46,250 to settle charges that its Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn operation had violated federal air pollution rules at its plant in Kalamazoo, Michigan.\n\nIn 2008 Pfizer agreed to pay a $975,000 civil penalty to resolved federal charges that it violated the Clean Air Act at its former manufacturing plant in Groton, Connecticut in the period from 2002 to 2005.\"\n\n**This is REALLY sick of Pfizer:**\n\n\"Pfizer apparently engaged in questionable practices abroad as well. In 2000 the Washington Post published a major expos\u00e9 accusing Pfizer of testing a dangerous new antibiotic called Trovan on children in Nigeria without receiving proper consent from their parents. The experiment occurred during a 1996 meningitis epidemic in the country. In 2001 Pfizer was sued in U.S. federal court by thirty Nigerian families, who accused the company of using their children as human guinea pigs.\n\nIn 2006 a panel of Nigerian medical experts concluded that Pfizer had violated international law. In 2009 the company agreed to pay $75 million to settle some of the lawsuits that had been brought in Nigerian courts.The U.S. case was settled in 2011 for an undisclosed amount.\n\nClassified U.S. State Department cables made public in 2010 by Wikileaks indicated that Pfizer had hired investigators to dig up dirt on Nigeria\u2019s former attorney general as a way to get leverage in one of the remaining cases. Pfizer had to apologize over the revelation in the cables that it had falsely claimed that the group Doctors Without Borders was also dispensing Trovan during the Nigerian meningitis epidemic.\"\n\n**Why in the world should ANYONE trust these criminal companies?

The following year Schering agreed to pay $500 million in penalties to the federal government to settle charges relating to manufacturing violations at four plants dating back as far as 1998.\"\n\n\"In 2001 press reports began to appear suggesting that Merck\u2019s heavily promoted arthritis drug Vioxx (and a similar drug made by Pharmacia) might not be as safe as they were initially believed to be. In 2004 Merck withdrew Vioxx from the market after being notified that users were found to have an elevated risk of heart attack or stroke. Several weeks later, the Wall Street Journal, which had obtained internal company e-mails and documents, reported the Merck management appeared to have known about the risks of Vioxx for years and maneuvered to keep the information from derailing its blockbuster product.\n\nA New York Times expos\u00e9 suggested that Merck executives had deliberately taken as long as possible in addressing Vioxx safety problems. The Times went on to report that, nearly a year before Merck management had received the results of the clinical trial that it said prompted the recall, the company had received preliminary results of a separate study indicating the cardiovascular problem. And yet later, the Times reported that, contrary to statements made by Merck, the company had cancelled plans for a clinical trial of its own back in 2002. \n\nSoon the company was facing investigations by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission along with thousands of lawsuits. As these pressures mounted, CEO Raymond Gilmartin resigned. In the first of those individual lawsuits to go to trial, a jury in Texas took just one hour of deliberation in 2005 to decide against the company and award $253 million in damages. In subsequent trials, Merck won some and lost others. In 2007 the company agreed to pay $4.85 billion to settle the remaining 27,000 lawsuits.\"\n\n\"In 2008 Merck agreed to pay the federal government more than $650 million to settle charges that the company routinely overbilled Medicaid and other government programs and made illegal payments to healthcare professionals to induce them to prescribe its products.\n\nIn December 2011 the Massachusetts attorney general announced that Merck would pay $24 million as its part of a $47 million settlement reached with 13 drugmakers to resolve allegations that they overcharged the state\u2019s Medicaid program.\n\nIn 2012 the Louisiana attorney general announced that Merck and four other companies would pay a total of $25.2 million to resolve allegations that they overcharged the state\u2019s Medicaid program.\"\n\nhttp://www.corp-research.org/pfizer\n\n\"During the mid-1980s, watchdog organizations such as the Public Citizen Health Research Group charged that Pfizer\u2019s widely prescribed arthritis drug Feldene created a high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding among the elderly, but the federal government, despite reports of scores of fatalities, declined to put restrictions on the medication. A June 1986 article in The Progressive about Feldene was headlined DEATH BY PRESCRIPTION.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration expressed greater concern about reports of dozens of fatalities linked to heart valves made by Pfizer\u2019s Shiley division. In 1986, as the death toll reached 125, Pfizer ended production of all models of the valves. Yet by that point they were implanted in tens of thousands of people, who worried that the devices could fracture and fail at any moment.\"\n\n\"In 2004, in the wake of revelations about dangerous side effects of Merck\u2019s painkiller Vioxx, Pfizer agreed to suspend television advertising for a related medication called Celebrex. The following year, Pfizer admitted that a 1999 clinical trial found that elderly patients taking Celebrex had a greatly elevated risk of heart problems.\n\nIn 2005 Pfizer withdrew another painkiller, Bextra, from the market after the FDA mandated a \u201cblack box\u201d warning about the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal risks of the medication. In 2008 Pfizer announced that it was setting aside $894 million to settle the lawsuits that had been filed in connection with Bextra and Celebrex.\n\nWith the acquisition of Wyeth (formerly American Home Products) in October 2009, Pfizer took on a new set of legal problems. The summary of legal proceedings in Wyeth\u2019s last annual financial report before the deal was announced went on for 14 pages. Most of the lawsuits discussed were product liability cases involving hormone therapy, childhood vaccines, the anti-depressant Effexor, the contraceptive Norplant and, most importantly, the combination diet drug known as fen-phen, which had been withdrawn from the market after reports that its use was linked to possibly fatal heart valve damage. Those findings unleashed a wave of tens of thousands of lawsuits against the company.\"\n\n\"In 1991 Pfizer agreed to pay $3.1 million to settle EPA charges that the company seriously damaged the Delaware River by failing to install pollution-control equipment at one of its plants in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 1994 Pfizer agreed to pay $1.5 million as part of a consent decree with the EPA in connection with its dumping at a toxic waste site in Rhode Island.\n\nIn 1998 Pfizer agreed to pay a civil penalty of $625,000 for environmental violations discovered at its research facilities in Groton, Connecticut.\n\nIn 2002 New Jersey fined Pfizer fined $538,000 for failing to properly monitor wastewater discharged from its plant in Parsippany.\n\nIn 2003, shortly after Pfizer acquired Pharmacia, the company (along with Solutia and Monsanto) agreed to pay some $700 million to settle a lawsuit over the dumping of PCBs in Anniston, Alabama.\n\nIn 2005 Pfizer agreed to pay $22,500 to settle EPA claims that the company failed to properly notify state and federal officials of a 2002 chemical release from its plant in Groton that seriously injured several employees and necessitated a major emergency response.\n\nAlso in 2005, Pfizer agreed to pay $46,250 to settle charges that its Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn operation had violated federal air pollution rules at its plant in Kalamazoo, Michigan.\n\nIn 2008 Pfizer agreed to pay a $975,000 civil penalty to resolved federal charges that it violated the Clean Air Act at its former manufacturing plant in Groton, Connecticut in the period from 2002 to 2005.\"\n\n**This is REALLY sick of Pfizer:**\n\n\"Pfizer apparently engaged in questionable practices abroad as well. In 2000 the Washington Post published a major expos\u00e9 accusing Pfizer of testing a dangerous new antibiotic called Trovan on children in Nigeria without receiving proper consent from their parents. The experiment occurred during a 1996 meningitis epidemic in the country. In 2001 Pfizer was sued in U.S. federal court by thirty Nigerian families, who accused the company of using their children as human guinea pigs.\n\nIn 2006 a panel of Nigerian medical experts concluded that Pfizer had violated international law. In 2009 the company agreed to pay $75 million to settle some of the lawsuits that had been brought in Nigerian courts.The U.S. case was settled in 2011 for an undisclosed amount.\n\nClassified U.S. State Department cables made public in 2010 by Wikileaks indicated that Pfizer had hired investigators to dig up dirt on Nigeria\u2019s former attorney general as a way to get leverage in one of the remaining cases. Pfizer had to apologize over the revelation in the cables that it had falsely claimed that the group Doctors Without Borders was also dispensing Trovan during the Nigerian meningitis epidemic.\"\n\n**Why in the world should ANYONE trust these criminal companies?

Why would owning a gun make you more likely to break into a house or steal a car or rape someone? That idea makes no sense.\n\nHowever, for homicide, I have trouble trusting these results. For one, this statement by the author of the study seems more like pro-gun propaganda than unbiased science:\n\n&gt;\"The most likely explanation is that most guns are possessed by noncriminals...\n\nMillions of gun owners in the US, vast majority not criminals. Seems legit.\n\n&gt; ...whose only involvement in crime is as victims, and...\n\nAgain, just based on the very high number of gun owners and the relatively low number of criminals, it does seem like a gun owner would be more likely to be the victim of a crime than the perpetrator thereof.\n\n&gt; ...defensive gun use by crime victims is both common and effective in preventing the offender from injuring the victim.\n\nThat seems extremely unlikely. Most people will go their entire lives without ever being the victim of a crime that would warrant defensive gun use. The odds that a person would be the victim of such a crime AND that person is a gun owner AND that person had their gun on them AND that person successfully used their gun to defend themselves just seems like too complex of a situation to call \"common.\"\n\nThe second reason I have trouble trusting the idea that there is no link between gun ownership and homicide is because a large percentage of homicides are not committed by \"criminals\" in the act of some other crime. A lot of homicides are the result of arguments between sexual partners, family members, neighbors, friends and acquaintances. Suicides, similarly, are the result of people making an emotional decision at their absolute lowest point to commit an act of violence.\n\nAnd herein lies the apparent link between gun ownership and higher homicide and suicide rates. A gun is a tool. A tool designed and redesigned for centuries for the primary purpose of killing human beings. And it's a really effective tool. Way more effective than a knife or a rope or a blunt object or poison.

While I do think that it is technically feasible down the line as storage technologies mature, renewables play an important role in the overall mix of generation needed to provide reliable power. \n\nI don't even want to get into the discussion of negative externalities that are not currently priced into non-renewable generation, but if that starts to become priced into the cost of non-renewable generation, they will not be able to be able to hold a candle to the cost of solar and wind.

While I think there's value in the optimism of this idea of a fully renewable power grid, let's try to stay grounded in reality and see how we can work to diversify our mix of energy supply. \n\nI wouldn't go as far as to call it a free ride on infrastructure, because that infrastructure is necessary for all energy generation. It just happened to be that renewables are way late to the party. As older coal power plans are being decommissioned in the near future and new technologies such as Solar, CHP, and Natural Gas take their place, the necessary infrastructure investment will be burdened by whomever decided to develop these projects, and the economics pencil out for each technology.  There is also value in the 'forcing' nature that renewables are playing in terms of putting pressure on the updating of current grid infrastructure. While it is a cost that everyone is going to have to bear in the near term, with renewables mainly being the benefactor, in the long term those upgrades were going to be necessary anyway as our country's energy demands increase. \n\nSome of the latest cost numbers from Lazard, of new solar and wind, including the necessary infrastructure upgrades, WITH subsidies, comes in at around 5.6 cents/kWh for solar and 1.4 cents/kWh for wind, this is compared to 6.1 cents/kWh for gas and 6.6 cent/kWh for coal. Removing renewbles subsidies, solar is at 7.2 cents/kWh and wind is at 3.7 cents/kWh. Gas and Coal generation receive subsidies as well which nobody likes to admit, coming in at around 0.8 cents/kWh. Removing those, Solar and Wind is still cheaper than coal, and almost on par with gas. \n\nNatural gas, at least in the US, is going to dominate new generation for the foreseeable future, as it should. The fuel supply is just too great to discount. The issue there is its transportation, namely the new pipelines that are needed. \n\nThe main thing that people should realize is that there's no best answer, and sadly the 'race to the bottom' for cost shouldn't be what drives us.  The motivation should be looking at where we want to be 50-60 years from now, and making smart investments in our infrastructure to get us to where we want to be. \n", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l", "qSentId": 10560, "question": "Anything that is heavily subsidized will grow fast.", "aSentId": 10561, "answer": "Like coal and corn.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l", "qSentId": 10560, "question": "Anything that is heavily subsidized will grow fast.", "aSentId": 10563, "answer": "Too bad people actually believe oil and coal are subsidized, rather than being heavily taxed, which is the opposite of being subsidized.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l", "qSentId": 10567, "question": "I had a discussion with someone about this.

Furthermore, creating a whites-only club further exacerbates the problem of marginalization, by creating more spaces where minorities aren't valued, because they're not even allowed in. So the reason it's ok when black people do it is because it fixes a problem, and the reason it's not when white people do it is that it makes a problem worse.

The doctor sees you, barely has time for you, has seen your symptoms a million times before and is totally uninterested.  He tells you to go home, get lots of rest, and drink lots of fluids. He shakes your hand and then immediately uses hand sanitizer.  You go home and try and sleep and eventually get better.  You get a huge bill in the mail from the hospital, but you don't pay it.  Several days to weeks later, you get a notice from your insurance company that they paid the bill.  A month later, you get a collections notice from the hospital for $3.14 outstanding balance after your insurance paid.\n\nAnd that's why people still go to homeopaths.  It's easy to scoff at snake oil, but we should still understand why people continue to choose them and what we can learn from them.  They're better at making the patient *feel* taken care of.  While we've all heard the anecdotes of people using \"alternative medicine\" to treat their cancers, the truth is that the vast majority of homeopathic patients will go to a regular hospital if they think it's serious *or have already gone to a regular doctor* and not been helped (maybe because there is nothing to be done, but they still feel un-treated).", "aSentId": 12031, "answer": "You need a better doctor", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l", "qSentId": 12033, "question": "Eat a couple cloves of garlic if youve got an infection somewhere and tell me it never works.", "aSentId": 12034, "answer": "You're thinking of herbal/plant based treatments dawg.

Moving to another state &amp; acquiring residency is one way to get cheaper tuition, true.  I've also written that there are a lot of scholarships available, finding &amp; applying for them is the challenge.  One can save a lot of money buying books through Amazon, sharing with another student or borrowing them from the college library.  (All things we did).  We also put our son into an IB high school.  He wasn't happy about the amount of homework involved in that program, but it paid off when he started college at a sophomore level, with a very good financial aid package.  Work-study is also a way to pay for some tuition.  Our son did all those things, and has a very low amount of debt as a result.  But there isn't a 'one size fits all' solution, unless we radically change our thinking.  IMO, while college shouldn't be free, it is an investment in the future and it should be supported as it is in other countries.  Or, students should get free tuition while attending, and then pay after they graduate.  I believe WA recently went to this type of system, students who have graduated pay a percentage of their income for a set amount of years.  If they are unable to find work or don't make enough, the payments are put on hold until that student is in a better financial position.  We'll have to see how it works out, I see a lot of good but also some bad consequences coming out of that.  \n\n&gt;  Pursue a degree that has plenty of staying power and prospects and don't pursue a feel good dream path and you're ahead of the curve. &gt; \n\nAnd most of those degrees are in the STEM majors.  \n\nBut don't underestimate the impact AI will have on the job market.  We're at the beginning of a huge shift.  For example, everybody needs stuff.  Everybody.  And it gets to the stores/your front door via transportation.  One would think that being a driver is a job with staying power, but with the advent of driverless vehicles, that will be changing very quickly.  And lots of people will be out of work.  Same with other careers, including ones requiring college degrees.    \n\nAnd the economy has a huge impact as well, the Great Recession has been very difficult for the kids graduating 2008-2012, even kids with 'good' degrees &amp; high GPA.

The good news is, you can astroturf to hell and gone, put\nup your own reviews, mention that the previous manager was hauled off to the \npsych ward by the police, etc, etc. \n\nThe key is to use a freebie tunnel, a one off free e-mail account or six, and to \nnot give smarmy glowing reviews.

Because for a place that's\nunder $750, be glad someone is there to answer the phone 9-5 on weekdays. :D \n\nIt's not a bad thing to warn people, indirectly, that you run the \"Funky Towel Estates\", \nthat they need to have at least some personal survival skills and self reliance, and if \nthey get a foot of snow overnight, that they should expect to shovel enough to get \nout to the main drive.

The damages resulting from this false impression can include potentially millions of dollars in economic losses, and have permanent consequences that can unjustly destroy a business.\"\n\nis worth thinking about before forming an opinion. We, because we are consumers, tend to look at things from one side. If tenants are using these reviews as bargaining chips, then that is just as evil as an apartment complex trying to discourage honest feedback.\n\nThis seems to be a very common style of business case where one customer figures out a way to be abusive of their position so instead of addressing that particular issue in absence of proper regulation, the company declares something absurd like a $10K fine for any negative review. \n\nOf course both the abusive tennant and the apartment complex are both wrong but this is really a great example of what regulation is and why we have it. In this case there isn't a happy medium between the consumer (tenants) and supplier (complex) and some very silly rules have been put in place that are over the top draconian.

I started spitting said medicine behind the radiator when parents weren't looking. They thought it wasn't working, cause I was energetic again. Took me to a different shrink who said I had aspergers, and, again, immediately medicated me. This whatever the fuck medicine did nothing, but thanks to the placebo effect, everyone thought it was working. At about age 11, I flat out refused to see any more doctors or be medicated.

I wouldn't go so far as to hope the grandmother gets killed for her stupidity and ignorance without knowing more about her side of the story (the death penalty is the full extent of the law that she's facing). I would hate to be charged for a crime, because it seems to be very difficult for anyone to believe you're innocent, whether or not you are innocent or guilty in actuality.\n\nAgain, it's a shitty situation - I myself hope they get some more privacy that they deserve in the midst of the death and this trial - I can't yet say that I hope the grandmother gets killed because of my situationally estranged armchair outrage.

Now, it is important to note that I am not black, but thought I could act like I was since I had black friends, hung out with them, and was accepted by them.\n\nOne day, I'm hanging out with one of my black friends, and I decide to freely use the N word.  It wasn't in a derogatory manner, as in, hey you N word.  It was more as a name for a friend, which is what I meant it to be.  My friend got quiet, was thinking, then punched me in my arm really hard so that it hurt.  \n\nI asked him why he did that, and he said \"fenix1230, you're my friend, which is why I'm not beating your ass.  Don't call me that word ever again.\"  \n\nIt was quick succinct, and honestly, I knew immediately that I was wrong.  And before you might think my friend was an idiot or what have you,  we are still friends, and he went on to get is JDE and is a practicing attorney.\n\nThe point is, as a young adult, I overstepped my boundaries, I was treated accordingly, and we all went on with our business as friends.\n\nSo yes, a hit or a spank does happen between adults, and it doesn't diminish the friendship, nor does it equal assault or battery.  \n\nOne important facet of growing up, is knowing that you aren't always right, or that the only way is your way.

Because I believed all the myths about ADHD I didn't believe my doctor when she told me after our 5th session that she thought it was ADHD.  Then I came home and started reading.  Really researching the issue, especially in women (31/f here) and I realized I fit all the symptoms to a T.

Not running in general.  Did you miss the last sentence of my last comment?  **So even a kid running around at lunch time wouldn't be dangerous or \"lethal\" but forcing 3 hours of running definitely pushes that boundary.** \n\nIts not dangerous for kids even if they run around like normal, forced running for 3 hours IS.  **And I want to specify here... There is a big difference between a kid outside for 3 hours running and playing around and forcing a kid for run for 3 hours like a drill instructor.**  Kids playing outside playing stop and rest, talk, take a breather, ect.  All which helps regulate their heart rates.  When someone forces you to run for 3 hours its far more strenuous and grueling than just playing.  \n\nThat is your opinion because you have never experienced the effects of ADHD.  You have never felt the disheartening feeling when you know you let someone down because something slipped your mind.  You have never felt the self loathing of sticking your foot in your mouth and saying the dumbest thing and the dumbest time, even though you KNEW you shouldn't say it, but you just can't help it.  Then you start thinking your fucking crazy... \"Why cant I keep my mouth shut\", \"why the hell did I just tell that joke to my boss\", \"the all think I'm fucking immature\", \"why cant I get a hold of this, what is wrong with me\".  \n\nCurrently there is only one way to diagnose the issue and that is through a mental health provider giving you an assessment.  Because I believed all the myths about ADHD I didn't believe my doctor when she told me after our 5th session that she thought it was ADHD.  Then I came home and started reading.

Just a prosecutor padding his conviction count and/or trying to run for some governmental position that a \"tough on crime\" and \"I'm the one that put that bad Grandmother in prison for life\" will earn him extra marks with the crazy voters.\nAccording to Alabama law, a person is considered to commit the act of murder if they intentionally cause the death of another human being. Someone can be charged with murder if they display extreme indifference for human life and engage in reckless conduct which creates a situation that puts another person at risk of death and then causes that individual\u2019s death.\n\n&gt; Murder is also defined as causing the death of another person while committing another felony act. If an individual kidnaps someone and they die as a result of the kidnapping, that can be grounds for a murder charge. A person who commits arson where a firefighter dies attempting to put out that fire is considered guilty of murder. It is a Class A felony, the highest felony charge in Alabama law.\n\n&gt;  Manslaughter is a bit different than murder. The law says that a person commits manslaughter when they recklessly cause the death of another person. You can be charged with manslaughter for committing a crime in the heat of passion also. A good example of a heat of passion crime is a man or woman who comes home to find their spouse cheating on them and they in the heat of their anger kill the spouse.

Just like how you're \"forced\" to take out the garbage, clean the dishes.\n\nI am curious about how you would define forced. \n\nAlso, this seems like a very different situation from taking out the garbage or doing the dishes. This is a punishment she is enduring. Most of the time, 9 year olds don't just get to opt out of those.\n\nThis seems very abusive. The grandma is an authority figure for a 9 year old. And if the grandmother thought that this was a normal punishment for lying about a candy bar, (warning: speculation) who can guess what other punishments the girl was subjected to. I would guess that she  was too scared to disobey. I don't know what your experience was growing up, but most people I know didn't develop the sense of autonomy required to tell grandma \"No\" for something like this at the age of nine. \n\nLong before the girl got to being on all fours and vomiting (as the article notes), the grandmother had crossed a line of common sense as well. Sitting outside for 2 hours at least (as the man the story cites claims he saw this take place over) and yelling at an exhausted kid to keep going because \"I didn't say stop\" is nonsensical. Note that apparently this grandmother is someone who watch a 9 year old run for three hours, since she was doing the full drill sergeant act.\n\nIt doesn't matter that it was a punishment for lying or if parents should punish their children for lying; what matters is that is was cruel and unusual and completely beyond what a normal, mentally-healthy person would demand. A 9 year old child should not be forced to run for three hours, bladder issue or no.\n\nShe apparently died because of fatally low sodium levels. Your body needs sodium to do everything. To make your heart beat and muscles contract. To create nerve impulses. To maintain the polarity of your cells. We're talking basic stuff here. So, I'm guessing that some time in those three hours, that girl started showing symptoms \n*of her body not working on the most basic level*\nand her grandmother blithely waved them away, and not in a way that someone who is responsible for a kid ever should.\n\nFinally, getting an asthma attack in the course of doing a pretty everyday thing--going to the store--is very, very different from dying because your cells can literally no longer function because you were coerced into running for three hours.

By completely stripping it of context and pushing the notion that everyone always means everything they say, they will turn a harmless, if distasteful, joke into a noose to hang him with.\n\nLook at this very thread: a bunch of people on a website *known for off-colour jokes* are dissecting an off-colour joke and happily agreeing that it means the accused is at least deranged, if not guilty.
