So we need to push to obtain open hardware and open drivers.\nToday this is 100% impossible, most hardware is closed, but spreading the awareness of the importance of being open at hardware level can help to change things tomorrow either by pushing manufacturers into opening their hardware or by building a critical mass of developers and backers for commercial availability of open hardware solutions in that field.\n\n&gt;Until that day, I\u2019m sorry but no phone is secure.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qgzt", "qSentId": 29976, "question": "Didn't these guys blast BlackBerry for not being secure enough and then proceed to have their phone rooted in under 5 minutes.
