The girl he sleeps with in the beginning of the film who's killed by her husband is a non-entity to him.  Vesper's the first actual emotional bond he's ever formed, and her death is Bond's second psychological demolition.  Everything after that is just wandering in the wilderness, emotionally speaking.  Trying to find some form of meaning in empty affairs, and in prosecuting his revenge on Vesper's killers.\n\nI hope and wonder if the entire reboot series will perhaps continue this quest for catharsis as a core plot element through each film.

When Cohen originally dropped out, the synopsis was that the film would detail Queen's rising star and culiminate at the Live Aid gig. \n\nThe reason the film needs to be \"gritty\" is that it's the tragedy of Mercury's death, not the majesty of his performances, that make his story fit to be turned into a movie. There are countless official and unofficial Queen documentaries out there if people just want to know about the tremendous heights they reached. But a story about Freddie has to include his upbringing, his family moving to Britain and their struggles, when he first met Mary and how the relationship blossomed, how his songwriting developed, falling in love with his last lover Jim and of course, everything related to his AIDS struggle, from his physical deterioration to his difficulties keeping it a secret from the press. That's a story built for the big screen, the complexity of a larger than life musical superhero juxtaposed with his daily struggle as a gay man in the height of debatably the biggest medical panic the world had seen up to that point. The story of a songwriter and band going from strength to strength commercially and finally stealing the show at Live Aid would be an injustice.

Imagine watching a movie with an omnipotent superhero. \"Anything can happen at any point in time, and it's not a paradox because we've decided that it's logical for anything to be able to happen at any point in time.\" It becomes uninteresting and nothing in the movie is really at stake, so there's no excitement, suspense or reason to care on a deeper level, beyond just entertainment. It seems akin to a lazy deus ex machina. The viewer's excitement, interest, suspense and emotional and intellectual investment in movies stem from the notion that every action that takes place has a logical consequence, and that there are logical limitations on what can actually happen. Cause and effect. Remove this and there's no reason to care, in my view. It's fine for the viewer of the movie to know what is going to happen at the end, but if there are no restrictions on what can happen and if the explanation for the events is simply \"because anything is possible in our universe\", there is no meaningful internal logic in the movie that restricts the events that can take place, and therefore no reason to get emotionally or intellectually involved with the movie and its characters.\n\nWe knew from the beginning of Titanic that the ship was going to sink and that Rose would survive because this is the prerequisite for the telling of this story, but every action in the movie had a logical consequence. There was a firmly established internal logic. You could emotionally and intellectually connect to the characters and feel as though there was a meaningful purpose in the movie and a logical goal that the people were trying to achieve by adhering to the firmly established rules of their universe. The movie was still meaningful because the point of the movie was to tell a heartfelt story of a young couple who were, from the perspective of the viewer, ultimately destined to lose each other under terrible circumstances.\n\nIn Interstellar, the prerequisite for the existence of the wormhole is the salvation of humanity, because future humans created the wormhole, which in turn was supposedly used in order to save humanity. Nothing is at stake in this movie because humanity had already been saved from the very beginning, which was the entire mission of the movie.

Then the film starts mentioning Replicants and then you see Harrison Ford and realize that this isn't just inspired by Blade Runner... it's a prequel that actually goes in depth and explains something cool about it... like how Harrison Ford is actually a robot or something.  That alone would be a cool experience, even if the film wasn't an A+.  Instead imagine if they blatantly say in the interviews and trailers that yes, this is basically a Blade Runner prequel and it's going to be amazing and blow your mind and then they go and lay out every major plot point in all the trailers. You'd finally watch the film and be very disappointed.

It's just a bit confusing because Nolan chooses that moment to play the omniscient observer. You could argue that none of them really knows if Brand actually made it to Miller's planet. All of that final depiction of Brand is really for the audience, to heighten the emotionality and hopefulness. Otherwise, if Cooper decided that he was going to look for Brand without any idea that she's alive, the film would have ended with a sense of uncertainty.

Nolan tried too often to make the audience feel sympathy for the characters, but they were all developed poorly.

Not trying to pick a fight, I'm genuinely curious.", "aSentId": 8480, "answer": "Yeah sure. For starters there is a massive time travel flaw that anoys the hell out of me. The whole movie is based upon the opening of a worm hole in space. It is explained later that future humans were the ones who created it to save us in the past. However, the movie is very clear about how if they did not find a new planet all life on earth would die. Now we cannot get to a new planet without the worm hole so how did humans manage to survive, find another planet, evolve to the point where they can manipulate time and space to open a worm hole and then open one in order to save the human race in the first place? It's one of those things where the time loop cannot be started without the assumption that we found a way to survive regardless.  And if we found a way to survive regardless why would we need to go back try to change the past, that would negate our existence in the first place?\n\nAlso the science of gravity and relativity take way to many liberties. For starters they want to use the theory that if you travel at the speed of light then you will age slower than those on earth. That being said they never come close to the speed of light. The only reason they can travel as far as they did is because of the wormhole not speed of travel. So there is no reason that his children age and the astronauts dont.  Also the concept of a higher rate of gravity causing there to be a difference in time between the ship orbiting the water planet and the surface of the planet is horrifying. Yes it is a real concept but not anywhere near as drastic as they propose. For instance if someone stayed in the international space station for 30 years they would probably  have about an hours worth of time different from someone on earth. The movie suggests that by only increasing the gravity by 30% you see a difference of 20 some odd years. Based only on the time the astronauts were on the surface there would have been virtually no difference in time. That also ruins the point of going to that planet in the first place because they said they had been receiving a signal from it for a long time but by their reasoning the ship had just landed and had not been on the planet long enough to send that signal.\n\nAfter that they move to Matt going into the black hole . I liked the idea of a construct that allowed people to to view multiple points of time at once but then they ruin it by having Matt suddenly know how to manipulate things in these time frames by making vague reaching gestures off screen. As if that wasn't weird enough they jump the shark immediately by suddenly giving him he ability to reprogram a simple wind up watch to describe the entire physics of the black hole using only Morse code. How did he reprogram the watch? How could it possibly hold that much information? That's got to be a couple terabytes of info at least. How do you translate physics equations with Morse code? None of that makes any sense.\n\nFinally he gets back home where there should not be any time difference to find that his young daughter is now dying of old age. However she was able to use the information from here watch to finally launch the massive space station into orbit to save the human race.  They ignore the fact thought that they then had decades to study and travel through the wormhole to find a planet but never did. Then Matt steals a ship to go back through the wormhole. Why did he need to steal it? Shouldn't they have wanted him to go? Shouldn't they have been sending more people through now that they knew what was on the other side?\n\nI guess for the most part I didn't like how the story seemed to have to change to fit what the director wanted to show. What he wants to show and what the story is should be a more coherent line. He wanted there to be more drams so he forced the children to grow up without a father. They wanted the journey to be hard so they made one of the astronauts have to spend decades alone.\n\nLike I said, it was fun to watch, I just cannot take it that seriously.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3s", "qSentId": 8479, "question": "Care to elaborate on why you thought the story was ridiculous?
