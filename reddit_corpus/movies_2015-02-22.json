It brought me back to those little memories I myself had forgotten, and made me aware of how powerful the passage of time is, as well as how far we've all come as human beings. The story of the dad becoming a better person was beautiful. The story of the mom doing the best she can, trying to find happiness and learning to let her children go, was heartbreaking and beautiful. And, while it may seem simple, seeing the boy grow as his consciousness and worldview expands, was beautiful to me. \n\nI felt the film did a good job of showing how the beauty of life exists not in big events, but in the little moments that we share with one another. The only other work of art I could compare it to is the play 'Our Town' by Thornton Wilder. It captures life in a graceful, honest and humble way.

Sure it has the slightly outlandish ending but that's nothing compared to the kind of sci-fi Nolan was evoking.

It would be a better movie if they hadn't spent half of it explaining everything to the audience. It really annoyed me because the exposition really hurts the pacing and doesn't make thematic sense, Cooper plays the everyman whose POV we're using to have the science explained but he's a trained engineer and former NASA pilot with a room full of physics textbooks. He's clearly supposed to be smarter than most of the audience and he should know enough to know either the basis of what they're trying to explain to him, or that he doesn't need to know it to fly the ship. \n\nBetween that and the heavy-handed 'love transcends everything' motif they keep bringing up really undermine what it could have been. If they stripped those things back to a bare minimum it'd be a much tighter film and the ideas at the core of the film would stand out better.

He made a space version of Hidden Fortress and was told to be original so he changed a load of stuff.\n\nDuring the production of the first film they hadn't decided anything of what was to come. Why else would they kind of hint at Leia being Luke's love interest and then remove scenes from Empire Strikes Back where Luke's like \"I'm going to go away for a bit\" and act like he wants to make out with her and the two literally move to kiss each other. But they cut that because by then they had decided they were related. In fact, it could be that they only shot it to fool most of the cast and crew of the twist. It was, after all, a detail only edited in in post-production. \n\nIf they had decided Leia and Luke were related during making the first one then Luke wouldn't have said \"good\" when Han said on the way to the rebel base he didn't like her and then act worried when Han seemed to change his mind. They were toying with a love triangle.\n\nThat said there was planning going into creating the world of Star Wars beforehand. Luke was going to be the general from Hidden Fortress and Annikin Starkiller was to be his apprentice. Starkiller's father was a mostly robotic organism. It's kind of fucked up, like only his head and arm were the only things not machine. I can definitely agree they did move ideas around, Lucas probably thought \"hey we can make Vader Luke's father\" but I hate it when people go around as if the existing Star Wars films are how they existed in Lucas's mind before he started writing The Star Wars, or even during production of the first film.\n\nThis is why I think all this repeated stuff seems silly. Okay, you repeated it. How does that have any bearing on the experience at all? The only thing visible other than the rip offs (or \"call backs\") is the idea that the prequels go from happy to dark and the originals go from dark to happy. Adding things in like a prophecy like \"it was all meant to be\", acting like a hipster to M Night Shamalan didn't work. Yes, we can tell Luke saved his dad. Yes we know the story of Vader and Anakin just by watching the original trilogy. We don't need to see what you've already told us in the original film. \n\nIn the case of this original Annikin's father, I suppose he is now the form of General Grevious.

Star Wars: the Flame Thrower!! The kids love this one.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3s", "qSentId": 1789, "question": "There's also a few other problems with this analysis:\n\n&gt;Another theme carefully woven throughout Episode I is greed. For example, the film\u2019s opening crawl describes a \u201cgreedy Trade Federation,\u201d a fact that Darth Sidious exploits over the course of the film to get his alter ego, Senator Palpatine, elected Supreme Chancellor. Qui-Gon uses the junk dealer Watto\u2019s greed to his advantage (\u201cGreed can be a powerful ally,\u201d he says), to get the parts to repair the Queen\u2019s ship and to free Anakin (again, who \u201cknows nothing of greed,\u201d says his mother). Also, Senator Palpatine says that the Senate is full of \u201cgreedy\u201d delegates. And Yoda\u2019s observation that Anakin is afraid to lose his mother foreshadows the emotional greed at the heart of Anakin\u2019s fall from grace.\n\nWait, so \"greed\" is a theme? But we only know people are greedy because someone says they are. In every example here it's all delivered in dialogue. Much like whatever suffering happened on Naboo we never see, people dying etc. How about show someone stealing something? You have a story in the slums on Tatooine, maybe show some greed there? Perhaps have Anakin have something stolen from himself and instead of complaining he willingly gives more of it to people who need whatever? That's a lot better than fucking saying \"he knows nothing of greed\".\n\nIt's like Lord of the Flies having the kids sit down and discuss the idea of children, from what we'd call modern civilised society, naturally descending into tribalism, savagery and ruling by superstition if there were no adult authority instead of showing the kids becoming savage and start killing each other. \n\nHell even the jedi think Anakin is special because of fucking numbers. Show us something. Maybe show something which stands out to the audience. Saying something like 'oh he is very powerful with the force helps him drive podracers which is normally too hard for humans' doesn't give the audience any indication as to what is 'impressive'. We don't know the capabilities of the aliens. We know the podracers move fast but why are humans handicapped in a way the aliens aren't. Would that make a 'chosen one' alien even more powerful than Anakin?\n\nWhy not have some making rock that no jedi can lift with the force because it's too powerful, and then have Anakin life it with the force easily. Instead we get some vague prophecy with no real details (how does bringing balance to the force involve killing off two darksiders with one jedi remaining?) feels shoehorned in based on the fact that audiences know Anakin redeemed himself and wanted to make it seem like someone sent from god to be our Jesus for the evening. What makes it worse is that by Revenge of the Sith the plot starts backtracking with Mace Windu's dialogue \"a prophecy that has been misread\" which turns out to have no bearing on the plot at all seeing as the film was designed for people who'd seen Empire Strikes Back (otherwise it wrecks the twist). We know nothing about this prophecy and it's like these expositions that Lucas calls a story is just janging keys in front of our faces going \"maybe it is maybe it isn't\". Urgh.\n\nIt is interesting the depths Lucas has gone to mirror the original trilogy in the prequels, however. This bit is referring to the attack on a character at the start of the second films in each trilogy:\n\n&gt;In both instances, the injured character ends up on the ground (laying in opposite directions).\n&gt;\n&gt;Also, notice how the \u201cblood markings\u201d are placed on opposite sides of the characters\u2019 faces.\n\nIt's kind of sad really. Yes, maybe some art house people will say 'omgor you've reused the same imagery in the prequels as you did in the originals. But with such smaller details like this it makes me wonder if he did it because he had no idea what to have in the films? No original ideas? It's not as if Luke was aways meant to be scarred, that was written into the plot because of Mark Hamill's accident, kind of like how they retold how Indiana Jones got the scar on his chin that Harrison Ford has. \n\n", "aSentId": 1790, "answer": "it feels like you're pointing out problems with the movies themselves, not the analysis.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3s", "qSentId": 1791, "question": "it feels like you're pointing out problems with the movies themselves, not the analysis.", "aSentId": 1792, "answer": "Well the analyse talked about greed.

When watching it as a child I didn't notice a lot of the subtle ones, like the start of Clones and Empire having a character injured and bleeding from the opposite side of the mouth. Things like Anakin losing an arm? Yes.\n\nThings like Anakin's point of view of the cockpit in Sith? Well that kind of works but it also makes sense because that ship is presumably a predecessor to Tie Interceptors and from Anakin's point of view he doesn't really change sides, he continues to work with the Stormtrooper-looking people and the Republic turns into the Empire. But what doesn't make sense is when this pre-Empire team has X-Wing-looking things. I know they wanted to bridge the gap being like \"this will develop, in 17 years, into the X-Wing we all know and love\" but it seems weird that what becomes the Empire would have the X-Wing looking things. If they wanted to imply that, according to Padme \"ever wondered if you're on the wrong side\" meaning the Separatists are the rebels then it would make sense for them to have the X-Wing-looking ships.\n\nSo these mirrorings seem only exist as a visual motif and not anything logical as well.

If there is something compelling content-wise, it's lost in the freshman english caliber writing style. I'm plodding through it, but nearly every paragraph is making me frown with how it's written. There may be some truth to it, in the breakdown of parallel scenes and all, but the piece itself is not particularly convincing in its presentation. It needs to establish more clearly that these parallels are intentional because with movies that are as dense as the prequels (and really, by 1970-80's standards the originals too) there's enough going on that you can find patterns even where none exist. Some of the parallels do feel stronger than others, where some of them feel contrived. The author makes little distinction between the ones that don't fit as well and the ones that do fit better, often bending things into generics to make the comparison feel stronger. (e.g. \"and then a character loses their appendage\" when trying to create a bridge between a nobody losing their arm and *the fucking protagonist* losing his hand, particularly when the *Clones* scene's parallel is *clearly* a new hope's cantina scene).\n\n Similarly, sometimes the parallels are told as \"It's an inversion/reinterpretation of what happened\" and sometimes they are told as \"And it's exactly the same as what happened\" but with little connection drawn between where the inversion is necessary and where the simile is necessary. It's well enough to identify these things, but if you can't also posit something about why there would be an inversion sometimes or a simile other times it loses credibility as an analysis. Meanwhile, the few attempts that do show up of trying to provide analysis of the content(not just the visuals) fall pretty flat. One example talks about thematic 'moral descent' in Empire/Clones but it's so garbled and nonsensically vague it could be talking about literally anything. Needs a lot of editing and probably some more visual aids. Throughout time codes would be useful to really drive the points home, not that things necessarily overlap at identical times but with this many stills it would aid the presentation to keep things more organized. \n\nStill. I can't dismiss it outright, but it is a very tough sell to suggest Lucas was really thinking this deeply about each and every scene when *so much* behind-the-scenes material paints him as being fairly out of touch in more way than one. Lucas well may have had a *Grand Strategy* in mind to create thematic overlaps and cyclical parallels of sorts, but his tactics for deploying it are rightly scrutinized and nothing in his demeanor gives much confidence he dissected the movies this thoroughly. Typically when you encounter filmmakers who are this detail oriented and this interested in subtext they don't mispronounce their own character's names, or call lightsabers 'laser swords' and can more readily appear 'on top of' what's going on. Compare say, Tarantino describing how he puts together a movie and the way he'll zero in on minutia and details with clarity and accuracy to Lucas who speaks vaguely, dispassionately, and often outright confusedly. If this was a grand project of his I would think he'd have *at some point* talked about it more openly instead(not even citing ring composition so much as just at least more openly talking about specifics and details) of vague 'it's like poetry' or 'there's more going on' type banter that doesn't tell us anything about what he's *actually* thinking.\n\nAlso, I have to wonder about the special editions. If this ring composition theory was truly in play I would think the special editions an excuse for Lucas to go in and shore up specific moments to better align with the overall structure. Instead he used that opportunity to add frivolity and excess. \n\nI'd be willing to give Lucas a lot of credit for this ambitious high-concept approach if it turned out to be the case that he intended it. I always applaud filmmakers trying to unwrap and restructure filmmaking in interesting ways, even if the end result leaves something to be desired. But in this case I think it'd be that latter clause. There are problems with the prequels that extend a lot further than any ambitious or particular high concept 'oh, cool' can rectify. \n\n", "aSentId": 1914, "answer": "To be fair, I like the article more for it's content and ideas than the writing structure.

She had a third so we took my room mate. Early in the day we met up at a parking lot that was walking distance to the Kodak Theater. We had our credentials and were given special wristbands. We were then walked as group up the main boulevard right where the cars would later drop off the stars. It was really cool because thousands of people were already lined up behind fences and barricades with tons of police everywhere. There we were, walking down the middle of the street heading right toward the main entrance. At the entrance to the red carpet there is the interview chair where Regis would later interview all the big stars.  My wife and I sat in the chairs and got our photo taken. \n\nWe were then moved through the security tent and into the red carpet stands that you see with all the wild fans. \n\nBeing up there was totally awesome. This was back before good cell phone cameras so we had brought our sony digital camera. There was an exposure setting that was off so a lot of my pictures turned out blurry unfortunately. \n\nI got Tim Robbins to acknowledge my frantic waving and I know it was me because he was mimicking my silly hand gestures. \n\nThe press section across from us is interesting. We were right across from Joan Rivers, who walked the red carpet, then had some assistants place a stool down where she then climbed over the press hedge and did her interviews for the rest of the night. \n\nThey set up these huge flashing lights to mimic flashing bulbs. It's blinding. Yes the flashing bulbs are 90% fake. \n\nAfter the red carpet was over, the three of us waited a bit for the crowds to exit. I'm not a big fan of herds so I made my party wait longer than normal. \n\nAs we exited, a I asked a staff member directions to the theater (red carpet fans got to watch the show from across the street at the el capitain) the staff member directed us the wrong way, toward the Kodak theater. We literally walked directly into the Kodak theater where the Oscars were just minutes away from starting.  At that point we were like, uh what do we do? should we take advantage or what do we do? We were wearing totally casual clothes at the time so we stood out like sore thumbs. I think the saving grace is that no one thought anyone as normal looking as us could have made it that far without many types of credentials (which we did have some).\n\nMy room-mate decides to take advantage and heads into the theater. That would be the last I saw of him for 24 hours. My girlfriend and I walked over to the edge of the main lobby where, and I shit you not, Billy fucking Baldwin came over to me and asked me for light for his cigarette. I didn't have one, but he proceeded to be totally fucking awesome and make small talk with us for a few minutes. \"no kidding? they just let you in?, you're from ____ I've got family there..blah blah\" \n\nAt that point I was getting nervous about getting arrested, so I grabbed my girlfriend and headed out a side door, directly into an outside area that contained at least a dozen cops. Of course they looked at us like, \"wtf are you doing here?\"  One came over immediately and was like \"let's see your credentials\"  I showed him my wristband (lol) and explained that an errant staff member had directed us into the theater where we clearly didn't belong. The police accepted that and escorted us to the barricaded walk to the el captain where we actually had tickets. \n\nI see my room-mate the next day and his story was the following. \n\nHe claims to have talked to Sean Connery, sat down next to the producers of cold mountain, and then was checked by security (wearing jeans and a T shirt)\n\nHe told security he had no pass, they said were shocked and couldn't believe he had made it in. He was immediately arrested and put into a holding truck for several hours. I think he was given a misdemeanor trespassing and put on probation for 30 days. He brought no camera and has no proof but he did show me his ticket later. He said he was blacklisted for the AA for life. lol\n\nTLDR: Got tix with girlfriend and roomy for red carpet, by mistake let into Oscars right before show started, roomy arrested.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/JvftONP,0rxwwQD,WSax9bG,TGU3bmD\n", "aSentId": 3000, "answer": "That's a great picture.

You claimed in your initial comment that very few directors can capture the moments of growing up like Ozu (an awards conjured comparison) and Truffaut when this isn't true. Linklater simply chose a conceit that would lend itself nicely to the concept, it doesn't mean it's great. In fact, I would argue his naturalistic style doesn't fit because when you're a teen things *do* feel more important than they actually are. It's a completely legitimate way of looking at the prism of that age bracket. That's how teens are. \n\nBoyhood chooses to abstain from offering those moments because it doesn't offer the release of seeing them. Doesn't mean it's better for it, in fact, because of its abstention it leads to Mason to be less of an inaccessible character. \n\n&gt;Except that's the complete opposite of what's going on in the sub now, it's essentially anyone who doesn't consider Birdman to be a masterpiece should be downvoted.
