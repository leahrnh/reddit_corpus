It is not a good reason to vaccinate all infants (boys and girls) more than a decade before they will need rubella immunity. \n\nI think I have to disagree here. There's steps to the process that you might be overlooking. Here's pros and cons of each method, being pretty liberal with the Pros. Be aware that not all pros are equal:\n\n**Test for rubella immunity in girls at puberty, vaccinate those not immune**  \n*Pros*:  \n* Boys never receive the rubella vaccine, and are thus not exposed to any risk involved with that vaccine.  \n* Girls who contract rubella in childhood never receive the vaccine, and are not exposed to any risk involved with the vaccine.  \n* Only girls who \"need\" it are given the vaccine, so less vaccine is needed. Save money?\n\n*Cons*:  \n*All girls need to get their blood tested at puberty. Exposing them to the risk of infection from the needle stick injury.  \n* \"Puberty\" is ill-defined. If you define it as menarche, then you have to monitor each child individually and do the test when they get their first period. You can't do population-wide screening at age 12, for instance. This would cost more money.  \n*  If you do test at a defined age in order to save logistical costs, then some girls might even be pregnant by the time they get to that age.  \n* The blood test for rubella immunity costs more than the vaccine.  \n* The blood test for rubella immunity is not 100% sensitive or specific. Some people will slip through the cracks and not get the vaccine when they should.  \n* Anyone who is found to not be immune needs a second needle stick to receive the vaccine, exposing them to risk of infection a second time.  \n* By not also vaccinating boys, the disease is rampant (but mostly clinically silent) among the population. The risk of exposure for any unvaccinated individual is very high. We have lost herd immunity.  \n* Some of the people who receive the vaccine won't become immune anyway (not 100% effective). Because we have sacrificed herd immunity, these people are at risk, and won't know it.  \n\n\n**Vaccinate all boys and girls in childhood**  \n*Pros*:  \n* You create herd immunity. Any people in whom the vaccine doesn't take, or who have a contra-indication to receiving the vaccine are protected by virtue of everyone around them being immune (and thus not carrying the disease).  \n* The vaccine can be given simultaneously with other vaccines, reducing the number of needle-stick injuries and the risk of infection.  \n* The vaccine can be given at a prescribed time in a child's life, in a systematic way, decreasing the chance that any individual gets forgotten about.  \n* Vaccine schedules create certainty in the amount of vaccine required, driving down costs.\n\n*Cons*:  \n* You vaccinate some people who even if they got the disease, wouldn't have a clinically significant illness.  \n* You expose everyone to any risk due to the vaccine itself.\n\nIn my opinion, it's not really an ethical minefield at all. It only becomes one if the risk of adverse reaction to the rubella vaccine is greater than the risk of getting rubella and subsequent illness.

My friend went to many specialists and she just ended up feeding her son whatever he could handle without screaming for days on end.  Everyone is different so she just had to tailor his diet to what he could tolerate based on his behaviors.  \n\nI really hope that in the future, there will be some major medical advances that will help people like your sister and my friend's son.  \n\nAlso, have your parents ever sought respite care?  I'm not sure how many hours they'd get.

As her sibling, I'm often severely conflicted over her quality of life and future prospects once our parents are dead. It's difficult to discuss with them because they both get highly defensive, but I can tell that they both have severe grief and depression issues that they seem resigned to just live out, \"doing our best\".\n\nMy sister is an adult, and she is fairly high-functioning in some ways, but has sporadic moments of extreme behavioral and anxiety-based episodes that still leave us guessing as to what's going on in her head (verbal skills are very lacking). As a result, it's extremely difficult for her to participate in programs because she basically needs 24/7 1-on-1 attention in order to maintain basic safety for herself and others, and her behavior can be highly disruptive (and sometimes violent). The default tends to be that she sits at home more and more and withdraws from any positive stimulation, so her skills regress. This comes in waves of making a big push to try new things, they don't work out, staff leave for whatever personal reasons and it's hard to replace them, and my parents slowly lose their minds more and more. The idea that things are going to change in yet-unforseen ways is basically what holds things together, I think.\n\nSo, being perfectly honest and non-emotional about it, no, I don't think that my sister's life is one that is really worth living if it were possible to go back in time or whatever, but of course that's a very abstract concept when we're talking about an otherwise healthy adult. Mental issues are a tricky subject.\n\n(And no, I'm not saying this in defense of the anti-vaccine camp, nor am I asserting that vaccines caused her autism.)","aSentId": 22536,"answer": "I completely understand your point.

On the other hand arsenic is perfectly natural and will kill you 100% of the time.\n\nYou are conflating my observation of a tendency within the system we know as nature with some idea of universal absolutes, i.e. the notion that all natural things are healthy and all unnatural inherently bad. I never made that claim.\n\nYour example is an interesting one. Based on my brief Google-search, arsenic is in a lot of things (dirt, sea water), so it doesn't really kill you 100% of time. However, I assume you mean \"refined\" arsenic in an appropriate dose kills you 100% of the time. Refined arsenic, I imagine, is difficult to find in nature.\n\nSo, by my thinking about highly refined stuff, I would suggest you stay away from refined arsenic, but you don't need much worry if you swallow a mouthful of sea water. \n\nSimilarly, I would prefer my kids stay away from refined sugar or apple juice, but have no problem with the idea of them chewing on a sugar cane or eating an apple.\n\nNature is fractal in my observation and so I use that to my benefit when I think I can. Mostly, I conclude, we are relatively fit to live on this planet for a time (is that really a surprise to anyone?). \n\nMy own lifetime of observations indicates validity in putting some significant amount of trust in that natural system as a whole, for me, anyway.

I suppose there might be an edge case. \n\nPromoting wide-spread adoption of allowing government forced health decisions based on an obscure edge case might change one or two people from dying *today* from measles, but seemingly would result in thousands more dying from drug overdose, drug complications and health complications like diabetes or heart disease from shitty, government-approved food replacements. \n\nThe difference I most commonly observe between myself and a \"pro vaxxar\" (including past-me) is the assumption that whatever the government position is the best \"default\" and the corollary that any contradiction requires a high level of \"scientific proof\".  Also, I tend to be more informed through more variety of sources.\n\n\nHere's my question: Why are independent thinkers disdained while profit-seeking, corrupt government is de facto considered to be \"acting in the best interest of society\"? Is it because they actually do that or because we so sincerely wish it so? Is it something more sinister like brain-washing?

At best, an average government bureaucrat is using fear to promote their own job-security interests.\n\nOne unspoken risk of vaccines: Regulatory capture is a natural consequence of big government.

During years when the flu vaccine is not well matched to circulating viruses, it\u2019s possible that no benefit from flu vaccination may be observed. During years when there is a good match between the flu vaccine and circulating viruses, it\u2019s possible to measure substantial benefits from vaccination in terms of preventing flu illness. However, even during years when the vaccine match is very good, the benefits of vaccination will vary across the population, depending on characteristics of the person being vaccinated and even, potentially, which vaccine was used.\nEach season researchers try to determine how well flu vaccines work to regularly assess and confirm the value of flu vaccination as a public health intervention. Study results about how well a flu vaccine works can vary based on study design, outcome(s) measured, population studied and the season in which the flu vaccine was studied. These differences can make it difficult to compare one study\u2019s results with another\u2019s.\nWhile determining how well a flu vaccine works is challenging, in general, recent studies have supported the conclusion that flu vaccination benefits public health, especially when the flu vaccine is well matched to circulating flu viruses.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l","qSentId": 23325,"question": "&gt; The reason why the CDC's website is \"hedging\" is because the effectiveness of the flu vaccine is different every year, based on how well they predict the strains that will be common that year.

Learn to rationalize a bit. The second amendment is designed so that the people may revoke the power of an oppressive American government.\n\nFurther: \n\nThe first 10 amendments to the constitution, the bill of rights? They are all individual rights. They were laid out SPECIFICALLY in that fashion to clearly delineate the rights of the individual vs. that which the government could control. All other rights in the Bill of Rights are individual rights. Whoever taught you in grade school didn't do a very good job, as this is a basic lesson regarding the Constitution.\n\nIt is not a happy or random coincidence that the right to bear arms falls in line right behind the right to speak your mind. Those things were put in place in that way for a very clear reason.\n\nLastly: In your little fantasy the government is responsible for \"well regulated militias\", right?\n\nI bet you, like most other people like you have never looked into the sentiment governing militias during the time frame of the founding fathers:\n\nDuring the Congressional debates, James Madison discussed how a militia could help defend liberty against tyranny and oppression:\n\nThe highest number to which a standing army can be carried in any country does not exceed one hundredth part of the souls, or one twenty-fifth part of the number able to bear arms. This portion would not yield, in the United States, an army of more than twenty-five or thirty thousand men. To these would be opposed a militia amounting to near half a million citizens with arms in their hands, officered by men chosen from among themselves, fighting for their common liberties and united and conducted by governments possessing their affections and confidence. It may well be doubted whether a militia thus circumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of regular troops. Besides the advantage of being armed, it forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of. The governments of Europe are afraid to trust the people with arms. If they did, the people would surely shake off the yoke of tyranny, as America did. Let us not insult the free and gallant citizens of America with the suspicion that they would be less able to defend the rights of which they would be in actual possession than the debased subjects of arbitrary power would be to rescue theirs from the hands of their oppressors.\"- (Source I Annals of Congress 434, June 8, 1789)\n\nAdditionally:\n\nThe Militia Act of 1792[17] clarified whom the militia consists of; \" Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America, in Congress assembled, That each and every free able-bodied white male citizen of the respective States, resident therein, who is or shall be of age of eighteen years, and under the age of forty-five years (except as is herein after excepted) shall severally and respectively be enrolled in the militia, by the Captain or Commanding Officer of the company, within whose bounds such citizen shall reside, and that within twelve months after the passing of this Act.\"\nThis is why you, as an American male of age sign up for selective service, so that when necessary the government can raise a militia of able bodied men from among the citizenry.\n\nThis idea is completely different than what you believe to be a militia impinging on the freedoms of the second amendment.\n\nEssentially, you're an idiot and your understanding of the 2nd is childish at best. \n\n&gt;Which leads me back to the fact that you are so god damned scared of the government\n\nI'm not \"scared\" of my government. I don't trust my government. Your government is not your fucking buddy. Governments are the greatest mass murderers in history. It's one simple fucking fact you would do well to not forget. \n\n&gt;Lol because your AR 15 is going to be able to take on a drone missle. id ask if you understand how ridiculous that sounds but its clear you dont.\n\nIt doesn't have to. The moment the United States military begins firing on the suburbs of America they have lost the battle anyway. Let's be frank: You believe the military is some monolithic organization and everyone involved is just going to walk in lock step to subjugate the American people. You're a fool, that would never happen. Some would, but many would not. We have over 300 million weapons in this country belonging to normal people. Our military would not stand a chance against us. You don't have to stop a missile, you simply stop the people controlling the drones. Again, a childish understanding of the issue. \n\nJames Madison calls you an idiot in the paragraph a bit above, you might want to look. \n\n\n\n\n","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l","qSentId": 23443,"question": "The problem is that you're drawing that conclusion by proxy and not by looking at the views of actual self-identified liberals or conservatives.","aSentId": 23444,"answer": "Anything you look at makes it pretty clear its the anti big pharm, corporate interest crowd that makes up the bulk.

You know damn well none of the doctors who did that to those black men in Tuskegee, Alabama got anything more than a story to tell out of the deal.  There's a reason the government makes you wait 30-40-50+ years in some cases to find out there's a lot of documents you still haven't seen, even in their blacked out versions they release only if you submit an FOIA request. In reality, anything that is approved for FOIA release should immediately be entered into the public record as well.  How's that for transparency?\n\nHell, I would never leave a child alone in a hospital room unattended for even a minute by at least one family member or friend of family, and I would never trust any child with the government, especially when high profile people are having sex with children and young teens and getting away with it.

The other 100 it is unknown whether there is a causal relationship. The one death that occurred was due to a kid's vomit getting into his respiratory track.\n\nAs far as doctors saying there's a causal relationship, they can't be telling the truth. They don't actually know unless it's a verifiable allergic reaction. Doctors can only tell you (truthfully) what the research reflects. That is  where their knowledge base comes from. Currently, the research does not reflect enough support to claim that there is a causal relationship between serious side effects and the MMR vaccines. \n\nRealistically, there are probably some causal cases. But, to put it in perspective, even if all 100 uknown cases were directly caused by the MMR vaccine, that would mean 5.3 out of 100,000 vacinees suffer complications. The mortality rate for giving birth is 21 out of 100,000 in the US. A large percentage of people die from giving birth than people having a serious MMR complication.\n\nNow, if you want to talk about money, there are greedy people. That's inevitable. Companies, like Bayer, are greedy. The people doing the research aren't, for the most part. You wanna know what a greedy researcher looks like? Wakefield. Dr. Oz. Those are the people you have to worry about. When they are directly trying to sell you something, that's when you know they're full of shit. But most researchers? We went into research because we like searching for the truth. If these researchers were greedy, they could have very easily become doctors and specialized instead of spending 6-10 years of their life making a barely livable wage while working 40-80 hours a week. Nobody goes into research to  make money, it's simply not feasible. And you have to understand something: research is a competition. I cannot stress to you how bad it is when you publish something and someone comes around and shows that your results are incorrect. And that does happen. There isn't like, a researcher's union or anything. If you prove someone else wrong, then they're less likely to get funding, which means more money for you (to do research. There isn't a pay increase). Bayer would literally have to pay off every single qualified researcher (in every country, mind you) to keep this going. It's just too unreasonable. And non-working vaccines? They certainly aren't doing that on purpose. They would be in serious legal trouble. Drugs have to go through FDA approval in which the companies show that their drug does what it claims and does not have horrible side effects. If there is any suspicion that it doesn't work, then the FDA goes back over it. Also, there would be a huge lawsuit if someone was able to show that the vaccines don't work. A law suit which would have them owe money to 90+% of Americans. That would be a huge risk to save on the extra small amount of production cost it takes to make it actually work.\n\nAs far as herd immunity goes, it's a fairy simple concept. Less people getting sick means less chance of exposure. Less chance of exposure means less chance of getting sick. [I like the animations in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAGHXMq9ttw). Now what you said about the location of where the outbreaks are is not contrary to herd immunity. There are two things which can explain this. First, vaccinations aren't 100% effective and their effectiveness can change with time. Second, measles comes from other countries. So, places where there is a high rate of international travel (whether for business or tourism) are more at risk. That's where a lot of these measles cases are occurring. Now if you want to look at who is infected in california, most of the people infected are unvaccinated. I remember reading somewhere that 70% or so were unvaccinated. Given that, what, 5-10% don't vaccinate yet they make up 70% of those infected kinda shows vaccines are doing something. Unless you think that a disproportionately large amount of unvaccinated kids showed up to disney land all on the same day.\n\nPeople laugh because the claims are kind of ridiculous. Although, the people laughing probably don't actually know why they're ridiculous. Those people are probably just assholes. But they have the scientific community behind their opinion. If you don't believe the president, you should at least believe the people who spend many many many hours looking into this stuff over some hand selected articles written by people who can't even tell you how a vaccine works. Researchers aren't out to get you, and they certainly aren't about making their entire life a lie for a quick buck. Maybe a handful are, but especially on a hot topic like this, there are going to be dozens of groups looking into this. And there are plenty of studies dating back to the 80's that looked into the dangers of the MMR vaccine. Some even comparing sets of twins. If there was anything which indicated a direct cause, then it would have been exposed by now.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l","qSentId": 24573,"question": "[1.8 million people, 3 million vaccines](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11144371)\n\n173 serious cases post MMR vaccine and 45% of them can be ruled out based on diagnosis after the fact or statistically normal occurrences without vaccines (i.e. 5% of chlidren get febrile seizures before the age of 5). The other 100 it is unknown whether there is a causal relationship. The one death that occurred was due to a kid's vomit getting into his respiratory track.\n\nAs far as doctors saying there's a causal relationship, they can't be telling the truth. They don't actually know unless it's a verifiable allergic reaction. Doctors can only tell you (truthfully) what the research reflects. That is  where their knowledge base comes from. Currently, the research does not reflect enough support to claim that there is a causal relationship between serious side effects and the MMR vaccines. \n\nRealistically, there are probably some causal cases. But, to put it in perspective, even if all 100 uknown cases were directly caused by the MMR vaccine, that would mean 5.3 out of 100,000 vacinees suffer complications. The mortality rate for giving birth is 21 out of 100,000 in the US. A large percentage of people die from giving birth than people having a serious MMR complication.\n\nNow, if you want to talk about money, there are greedy people. That's inevitable. Companies, like Bayer, are greedy. The people doing the research aren't, for the most part. You wanna know what a greedy researcher looks like? Wakefield. Dr. Oz. Those are the people you have to worry about. When they are directly trying to sell you something, that's when you know they're full of shit. But most researchers? We went into research because we like searching for the truth. If these researchers were greedy, they could have very easily become doctors and specialized instead of spending 6-10 years of their life making a barely livable wage while working 40-80 hours a week. Nobody goes into research to  make money, it's simply not feasible. And you have to understand something: research is a competition. I cannot stress to you how bad it is when you publish something and someone comes around and shows that your results are incorrect. And that does happen. There isn't like, a researcher's union or anything. If you prove someone else wrong, then they're less likely to get funding, which means more money for you (to do research. There isn't a pay increase). Bayer would literally have to pay off every single qualified researcher (in every country, mind you) to keep this going. It's just too unreasonable. And non-working vaccines? They certainly aren't doing that on purpose. They would be in serious legal trouble. Drugs have to go through FDA approval in which the companies show that their drug does what it claims and does not have horrible side effects. If there is any suspicion that it doesn't work, then the FDA goes back over it. Also, there would be a huge lawsuit if someone was able to show that the vaccines don't work. A law suit which would have them owe money to 90+% of Americans. That would be a huge risk to save on the extra small amount of production cost it takes to make it actually work.\n\nAs far as herd immunity goes, it's a fairy simple concept. Less people getting sick means less chance of exposure. Less chance of exposure means less chance of getting sick. [I like the animations in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAGHXMq9ttw). Now what you said about the location of where the outbreaks are is not contrary to herd immunity. There are two things which can explain this. First, vaccinations aren't 100% effective and their effectiveness can change with time. Second, measles comes from other countries. So, places where there is a high rate of international travel (whether for business or tourism) are more at risk. That's where a lot of these measles cases are occurring. Now if you want to look at who is infected in california, most of the people infected are unvaccinated. I remember reading somewhere that 70% or so were unvaccinated. Given that, what, 5-10% don't vaccinate yet they make up 70% of those infected kinda shows vaccines are doing something. Unless you think that a disproportionately large amount of unvaccinated kids showed up to disney land all on the same day.\n\nPeople laugh because the claims are kind of ridiculous. Although, the people laughing probably don't actually know why they're ridiculous. Those people are probably just assholes. But they have the scientific community behind their opinion. If you don't believe the president, you should at least believe the people who spend many many many hours looking into this stuff over some hand selected articles written by people who can't even tell you how a vaccine works. Researchers aren't out to get you, and they certainly aren't about making their entire life a lie for a quick buck. Maybe a handful are, but especially on a hot topic like this, there are going to be dozens of groups looking into this. And there are plenty of studies dating back to the 80's that looked into the dangers of the MMR vaccine. Some even comparing sets of twins.

First off, I said an On Table claim is 1 to 2 years.  On Table claims are settled the quickest.  If we relied on individuals to sue vaccine manufacturers every single time they had a claim, you'd be looking at a class action lawsuit that would take a heck of a lot longer than 2 years.  You'd have to gather a large number of victims, get a preliminary judgment to allow the case to go forward, gather evidence, numerous expert witnesses, have a jury trial, and then wait for a dragged out appeals process.  For an On Table claim, there's none of that through VICP.  Get a lawyer, submit the claim, HHS makes a decision, and then you get compensation if your claim is On Table.  For Off Tablet claims, which are those that are injuries not listed in the table, the longest part of the entire process is gathering evidence and expert witnesses.  These are the ones that actually go to court and where you saw a lot of autism spectrum disorder cases in the past (very few of which were compensated).  \n\n&gt;Meanwhile you can't afford your child's healthcare costs due to injury.\n\nChildren's health care insurance is cheap.

People who have just snuck across the border tend to have a very small contact parameter for at least the first few weeks they're here.  Conversely, an affluent world-traveling US citizen (which is a redundancy btw) is going to be in contact with lots of people immediately upon returning to the US.\n\nthe second factor is vaccination rate in the country where the ZP contracts the illness.  affluent World-traveling US citizens could be coming back from anywhere, so any vax rates are possible.  by contrast, vax rates in Mexico (which contributes the vast bulk of sneak-ins across the border) and several significantly contributing Central American countries are actually HIGHER than they are in the US.  \n\nhere is a [comparison of published vax rates](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j7_vpIp3WjCb8gA2SAu1u_nI5VN0xQIw1-Y14lsgtT0/pubhtml) for USA, Mexico, and the four Central American countries most associated with last year's \"Child Border Crisis\".  of the six countries, USA ranks #4 in overall vax rates.  \n\nCONCLUSION:  While it is true that most outbreaks of vaccine preventable disease in the US do arise from a person recently entering the US from a foreign country, for the reasons given above, such a person is much more likely to be an affluent world-traveling US citizen returning from a visit abroad than to be an \"illegal\" sneaking in across our Southern border.

Many people who are against blanket vaccination aren't necessarily concerned with autism. Some research suggests correlation with severe allergies/asthma as immunoresponses developed through overstimulation during the immune system's formative stages. Certainly, correlation is not causation; however, we can't necessarily accept blindly such statements as harmless simply because \"it's science.\" Methods change. Interpretations of data changes. Etc. While the scientific method itself is immensely valuable, its conclusions don't exist within a vacuum separate from cultural perceptions. It is probably a lost cause to suggest to techies that science is not god, but a human institution, but I urge you to consider the following.\n\n- Rates of common diseases were in decline prior to compulsory vaccination due to germ theory, better sanitation and nutrition. We should consider rising childhood poverty/nutrition, failing infrastructure and population densities if we want to undserstand disease resurgence more fully.  \n\n- Most commonly vaccinated diseases are not overwhelmingly debilatative or fatal. Complications in the era of compulsory vaccination have to do with misdiagnoses and therefore delayed treatment. Perhaps there is a statistically insignificant (life on the edge of the SD bell curve!) chance of complications in vaccination, but is this risk any greater than the statistically insignificant change of debilitation/fatality?\n\n- Nature bats last. End of story. Microorganisms evolve, hence antibiotic resistent superbugs. At some point we will view our war against nature as the singular factor in our fall as a civilization and, quite possibly, our extinction as a species. \n\n- Perhaps, \"misinformation\" campaigns wouldn't be as effective if people still valued the health care system itself. Few I know believe that the medical establishment is without its own agenda. Especially when you look at the cost of schooling/insurance/operations and the incentive to push drugs for commissions. Consider issues of generalized instituional trust as affecting decision-making.\n\n- Some people (myself included) don't hate vaccination. We recognize that it isn't a cure-all for disease and that it is ok to slow down the recommended vaccination schedule. More importantly, it does not have to be rooted in scientific illiteracy but in a more nuanced philosophical literacy. \nWe should welcome a healthy skepticism about the implications of our submission to the technological apparatus (GMO and patents on life? Etc.). We should see this non-debate for what it is: extremism masked as anti-extremism. In some respects, a narrative that exposes, at least for me, the desparation at which we cling to our faltering cosmology.\n\n ","aSentId": 26494,"answer": "I understand frustrations with health care system within America but I don't really understand how these points apply broadly to vaccination.

Just because it isn't a leading cause of death doesn't mean it doesn't kill (or debilitate) a lot of children who don't have the luxury of turning to modern medicine when the going gets rough. Everyone in global health knows vaccines are a part of a broader offensive that does include sanitation and nutrition. But kids get sick, so you need medical infrastructure and to not burden that infrastructure (as I mentioned in a few other comments, you need preventative measures like vaccinations. In the 70s, measles was an epidemic in Mexico (you can imagine that taxes a poor country's resources) and after a vaccination program, was eliminated. The US isn't Mexico, but the social cost is still very high because it costs a ton to contain. And you mention the leading cause of death in America being obesity and cancer, but part of that is because we have eliminated other concerns through various public health programs and infrastructure. And cancer may be in part due to environmental factors, but a rise in cancer also is associated with the rise in longevity. \n\nI totally agree with political propaganda based on fear. Ebola and ISIS were absolutely ridiculous. But many of the people I know who are suspicious of vaccinations buy into that fear narrative and believe any number of conspiracy theories. I do not see the hysteria from \"pro-vax\" people that I see from \"anti-vax\" people. There are legitimate concerns about fracking and GMOs, just are there may be legitimate concerns about new vaccine safety or drug side effects but I think a large portion of the backlash is because concerns are often articulated with outright false or misleading information. \n\nAs for testing, maybe there's compulsory testing that will be declassified 70 years from now, but there are tons of willing volunteers and we live in an age where whistleblowing is easier. I've done studies myself (not pharmaceutical, just scientists trying to figure out medical information about whatever population) and they brief you up and down. Some of our medical information comes from past unethical practices but that doesn't mean they shouldn't be used to save lives now. \n\nI think most of the concerned people are vaccinated simply because most people are vaccinated statistically speaking. But many people have immuno-suppressed loved ones or just a general concern for those people. And, as you said, there is a small chance the vaccine does not work. And of course immunity is not lifelong (hence booster shots). There may be some illusion of safety with certain interventions, but that applies to medicine in general (including alternative medicine) and isn't limited to vaccines. For example, I know someone who swears up and down by whatever herbal concoction (and I don't dismiss herbs) but is sick all the time and eats incredibly unhealthily.  I don't disagree with you that health is holistic but I think the quick-cure ideology permeates everyone. I'm more concerned about rampant antibiotic use and OCD moms sanitizing everything.

Numerous New York Times stories, beginning in 1996, began scrutinizing Columbia/HCA's business and Medicare billing practices. These culminated in the company being raided by Federal agents searching for documents and eventually the ousting of the corporation's CEO, Rick Scott, by the board of directors.[9] Among the crimes uncovered were doctors being offered financial incentives to bring in patients, falsifying diagnostic codes to increase reimbursements from Medicare and other government programs, and billing the government for unnecessary lab tests,[10] though Scott personally was never charged with any wrongdoing. HCA wound up pleading guilty to more than a dozen criminal and civil charges and paying fines totaling $1.7 billion. In 1999, Columbia/HCA changed its name back to HCA, Inc.\n\n&gt;In 2001, HCA reached a plea agreement with the U.S. government that avoided criminal charges against the company and included $95 million in fines.[11] In late 2002, HCA agreed to pay the U.S. government $631 million, plus interest, and pay $17.5 million to state Medicaid agencies, in addition to $250 million paid up to that point to resolve outstanding Medicare expense claims.[12] In all, civil lawsuits cost HCA more than $1.7 billion to settle, including more than $500 million paid in 2003 to two whistleblowers.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l","qSentId": 27204,"question": "Politifact. lol. \n\nYou mean the left wing Conservative/Republican bashing machine?\n\n\nIf you're going to participate in the we-hate-all-rich-people circle-jerk, at least have a somewhat reliable, somewhat objective source.","aSentId": 27205,"answer": "It's not politifacts fault that many republicans make false statements.

","aSentId": 27637,"answer": "&gt; There have been several examples of private companies fighting with the government over handing over logs and other information regarding internet access.\n\nThere's also a lot of cases of local municipalities and states fighting federal requests in court. The exact same mechanism, in fact. The same avenue is available to a municipal ISP or local utility co-op, and they have no greater incentive to turn your data over to the feds than private companies do.\n\nActually, given the history here, private companies tend to roll over a lot easier on these matters. AT&amp;T went as far as hooking the NSA up to their network closets without so much as a court order.\n\nYou're trying to make it seem like private companies somehow have some greater incentive to protect your data, or greater ability to do so, but neither case is actually true. A municipal ISP is no more in the federal government's pocket than any other small ISP, and a lot *further removed* from the government's pocket than the big national telcos are.\n\n&gt; And just because something is a public program, doesn't mean they wouldn't have strings attached.\n\nName a single federal public program that offers telecommunications companies money in exchange for using specific routing equipment. That would be a huge scandal since it would actually *violate* longstanding procurement regulations.\n\nNote; telling companies *not* to use insecure Chinese routers is not even remotely the same as insisting they must use Cisco, neither is there any money tied to that recommendation.\n\n&gt; I don't know if you've ever done procurement for any type of government entity, but they definitely have to stick to specific hardware guidelines if the money is provided federally.\n\nA) Yes, I have. Worked with a federal government contractor for a few years in their asset management department. Admittedly on the IT side of things, but that necessitated understanding a fair bit about the procurement system and the reasons for its odd foibles.\nB) Different government entities have widely, radically differing purchasing policies. The same rules that apply to federal agencies and contractors do not apply to state agencies, and *definitely* not to local municipalities.\nC) Different programs have different requirements on how money can be spent.\n\nSo, let's look at a municipal isp as an example. They're not a federal agency or funded by a federal agency, so none of those rules apply. They might theoretically be able to access some existing programs that offer money for broadband deployment, utility maintenance, community block grants, etc. However, such funding sources are also open to private companies. If drawing on such funds constitutes a threat to their independence, then it's equally a threat for municipal isps and private isps. \n\nThat said, any applicable state-level procurement regulations would apply differently to different sorts of municipal ISPs, and wouldn't be some immediate in-road for three letter agencies to demand they use only hacked routers. It's not like the only way to set one up is to have it directly owned by the city--it could be operated as a public-private partnership, for example. The city might own the infrastructure, and a private company manages it under the city's oversight. Alternately, a community-owned utility co-op, which would fall outside of these regulations entirely. You might say \"well, that means the government can control what they use!\", but that doesn't really happen between these sorts of levels of government. Federal purchasing requirements do not apply to local city governments, for example. Local regulations on purchasing will apply, as might state requirements, but not federal requirements.\n\nIt certainly isn't some direct means of control for the three letter agencies. You're dramatically overstating the role the feds would have here. There wouldn't really be any federal money here at all--no one's talking about the feds funding municipal isps, only preempting state laws that prohibit them. These municipalities aren't begging for federal money--they don't even need it to make this happen. The whole point of these municipal ISPs is letting cities control *their own* telecommunications infrastructure, not letting the feds do it.\n\nThis is no more a threat to privacy than letting the federal government give block grants to communities to build out bus systems--because shadowy FBI agents might use those block grants to mandate that the local bus authority install microphones and spy cameras in all of its busses. It's a silly position to hold, given the immense friction between federal and local governments. They just operate at totally, totally different levels. Federal procurement requirements can be arcane and silly, but their function is generally to keep people from wasting money. We can argue all day about whether they do that or not, but they certainly wouldn't be able to be leveraged to make municipal ISPs buy routers from the NSA or whatever.\n\nMoreover, fragmenting the telecom market in general would make it far more difficult for the federal government to actually spy on people. As it stands, they just have to make a back-room deal with a handful of major national telecom companies and they get an inside view on your data. If every municipality in the country were doing it, they'd need to draw up deals with several thousand ISPs.\n\n&gt; Schools are a perfect example of that. There's a reason why the bulk of school districts used Compaq and then Dell in the 90s - mid 2000s.\n\nYeah, because major manufacturers like Apple, Dell, and HP offered steep educational discounts, combined with a general tendency among state and local educational authorities to issue mandates for expanded technology in the classroom.

Furthermore, California is the top state in agriculture, making $44.7 billion.  The next biggest state is Iowa, with $31.9 billion, and California has a far more diverse crop selection than many other states, thanks to it's climate and soil.  (All this data is coming from the 2013-2014 Ag. Stat overview.)\n\nTo go with diversity, California is the only state that is a major producer of almonds, artichokes, dates, figs, grapes, kiwi, olives, peaches, pistachios, plums, pomegranites, walnuts and some variants of rice.  That's not all they grow, just stuff that wouldn't be found in any other state should agriculture in CA stop.  Other crops like broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, garlic, alfalfa, tomatoes and others would be massively impacted if one of our most fertile states called it quits.  That would massively suck, because a lot of those are staple foods for humans and livestock.  Oh, and that's not even mentioning livestock/dairy!\n\nStopping agriculture in California will impact produce and meat prices across the country.  It's already more expensive to buy fresh produce than to buy a box of macaroni, and that's impacting the health of low-income families.  Imagine how much worse that'll get if the prices go up.  I think right now it would be in the best interest of the taxpayers AND the state (not to mention the 80,500 ranches and farms) to get some desalination plants, or other careful water-management resources.

The taxpayers are getting shafted because big agriculture can afford to spend millions lobbying why they not only deserve 80% of the water but should get more.\n\nThat's pretty close but it could use some context. \n\nFirstly we have to understand that there are two physical issues here: reduced surface water flows due to the extended drought *and* the over pumping of aquifers and the resulting reduction in groundwater storage. Also playing a large role in how water is administered are a bunch of state and federal institutions, which quickly gets messy.\n\nSticking to the highlights:\n\n1. California imports lots of water and then ships it around the state.\n2. California get a large portion of their surface water from two sources: the Colorado River and the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers which drain the western Sierra. \n3. Even in wet times demand for water exceeds the surface water totals. California has a huge number of acres devoted to agriculture and many times pumping ground water is much easier than obtaining surface water rights.\n4. California's ground water laws were written back when development and growth were the goals. So new farms were incentivised with cheap access to groundwater, a resource they pretty much treated as infinite.\n5. The number of farms exploded and the draw on aquifers began to exceed their recharge rate (see subsidence photo linked in thread). Agriculture now makes up for 80% of consumptive water use in the state.\n6. Municipal growth adds for demands. Owens River is a classic water story.\n7. The drought hits and things go to hell. Surface water volumes are reduced across the board. \n8. The demand on groundwater grows far past sustainable levels.\n9. The agriculture industry doesn't want to die. They make a lot of money growing stuff. Much of California has a great growing climate if you can provide enough water. \n10. Looking at the states water budget is pretty grim. Increasing temperature changes due to climate change will have a pretty dramatic impact on the amount of surface water available. As temperature goes up precipitation regimes will change: more snow will fall as rain and evaporate before being included in groundwater recharge or surface water flows. Also increased temps will increase evaporation rates on all surface water. Less surface water = more groundwater pumping.\n11. Aquifer mining isn't about to get fixed. The new groundwater laws have been pretty heavily criticized as not going far enough to protect aquifers. The problem is, agriculture depends on cheap plentiful water. You can't grow stuff in Imperial Valley without importing or pumping cheap water. \n12. So if this is all to get fixed the state has to use less water. There is currently no agency or institution that has the capacity to get the water budget under control. Most of the rules governing water use were written a long time ago with different goals in mind.\n13. The obvious answer is that agriculture has to use less water. The cities have room to reduce their consumption, but all water use by municipalities is a drop in the bucket compared to agriculture use. Agriculture makes a lot of money for California and some people really don't want to see that change.\n14. Protecting aquifers is really the issue at the end of the day. Without groundwater everyone is going to suffer.\n","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l","qSentId": 28962,"question": "&gt; big agriculture\n\nThose inconsiderate assholes...feeding people.

First, the water they inject isn't pure to begin with, and any additives put into it are highly regulated. Second, the salts and \"contaminants\" in the water that comes out are picked up from the rocks that it passed through. And they do clean out and try to reuse as much water as feasible. Why? Because water is expensive to oil producers and profit provides the best incentive to waste as little as possible. The challenge with protecting water is that it's so plentiful, it's hard to motivate good stewardship. \n\nWith that in mind- if you want to attack someone, try attacking agriculture rather than oil production. They are the biggest abusers of water supply and the biggest polluters of water through fertilization and pesticides. What's more- they are not required to drill expensive wells thousands of feet below the surface to safely store their water- because their water just runs off into our supply. Finally, US agriculture is supported by the largest pork barrel subsidies in the world. It's like welfare on steroids. Crops didn't produce well this year- have some tax dollars. Decided to not even plant anything this year- we will pay you for that too. Oh, you screwed up the harvest - have some farm insurance payouts, subsidized by tax payers. Oil companies don't have that type of insurance and it is damn hard to find and produce oil economically - not to mention super risky for your capital investment. Oil and gas are critically important to our way of life. That's why Oil does benefit from other subsidies and tax breaks, but nothing near as grossly extravagant as farm subsidies. \n\n\n","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l","qSentId": 29357,"question": "I'm a liberal, but it seems interesting that CA's Democratic government allowed corporations to poison the aquifers in the Central Valley, a historically conservative part of the state.

Before Obamacare, roughly 86% of people had insurance.\n\n&gt; thats why you dont wait\n\nNo, that's not the reason. The reason is that I (or my insurance company) pay a lot for it. You get what you pay for.\n\nTake an example: Couple of years ago I had a damaged ligament in my knee from playing soccer. Now this is a kind of injury that a guy in his 30s can live with for the rest of his life. I could walk just fine, I just couldn't play sports anymore.\n\nEven so, I was blown away by the quality of care I received on a very average insurance. Immediate MRI, access to a top specialist, surgery within couple of weeks and fully covered physical therapy for 6 months. It cost about $30K. I paid around $3K in various co-pays and deductibles and the rest was paid by my insurance company.\n\nIn a rationed care system like the NHS, this is an abomination and a waste of money that could be better spent on seriously ill people. I would be relegated to a waiting list, at best an X-ray and whatever the cheapest procedure they can do on it. \n\nThis is the problem. Its my knee and it is kinda important to me. I don't give a shit that it is not important to the rest of the society. That's the difference between liberty and forced collectivism.

Not trying to down talk or be confrontational... just realistic over most of the topic sub components as the scenario described leads to a very wide array of issues. \n\n1. The items as described may be an indicator that the computer is already infected...\nIf you have a popup blocker, some decent antivirus/anti-spamware program those should not come up. At least if the browser security settings are done right.. ie to not allow automated installation of unwanted programs. Nothing should ever install on your computer without prompting you for permission to do so. (Norton and McAfee do nothing to help you... they are less than useless TBH)\n \n2. People not recognizing those as an obvious scam.. well that is a whole thing i wont even want to address. The fact that they popup like that is the clue... no reputable site or service provider does that. \n\nUnless you know and trust the source of a program prompting for a permission to install things on your system the automatic click should be on the Deny permission/Cancel button. If a program wants to add \"services\" or toolbars on to your system that are not necessary for the functions of the primary component.. the answer is a resounding \"NO\". \n\nThings such as yahoo/ask/etc. toolbars have been a doorway through which other less than desirable programs can be gotten on to your system by less than honest people... that plus technically most of those toolbars send back to their authors customer data and as such are technically a form of spyware. \n\nIf your browser freezes and becomes non-responsive instead of clicking accept or anything else on that page press ctrl alt delete , open up the task manager, on the process tree end right click the browser name end end task to kill it. \n\n\nA quick search to help with all of that http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/search?q=computer+maintenance&amp;sort=relevance&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all\n\n\nEdit: Even things such as \"automatic forwarding\" should prompt for you to give it a permission on whether or not you want it to happen if security settings are in proper order.\n","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l","qSentId": 31314,"question": "It's more than just who clicked on it, some you need to install a program then share the page to unlock the program.","aSentId": 31323,"answer": "Sometimes, they are able to harness certain vulnerabilities to do drive-by installations.
