Worst part of that death is the pain. \n\n&gt;the body is very good at blocking out pain. \n\nBullshit, then why would we need powerful pain killers. Soldiers use to carry morphine and that was used to at least ease the pain before death. Shit if that statement is true why is torture even a thing? \n\n&gt;its not good at blocking out fear.\n\nNo, just like pain it's not. They both suck and it's a pointless debate on which is worse.

The most common are HDG (heading) and NAV (area navigation).  HDG is used to have the aircraft hold a specific heading.  This is common when ATC is directly instructing your flight path.  The other mode is NAV, where you command the aircraft to follow a programmed course over the ground.  This is the most common mode for en-route navigation and final approach.  It is likely that this aircraft was in a NAV mode, and if they reached the end of the programmed flight path, the aircraft will disconnect the NAV mode and return to a more basic lateral navigation mode, such as HDG or (in the case of my aircraft, ROLL, which would basically act as a wing leveler in this instance).  It will also signal a visual and aural alert tone.\n\nNone of this addresses altitude, however.  This is what we call vertical navigation, or VNAV.  There are a number of different ways this can be programmed (vertical speed, flight path angle, flight level change, etc.) but the important things to note about automatic vertical navigation is that you need a mode and a selection.  For example, I am flying at 32,000 feet and air traffic control requests that I descend to 30,000 feet.  The first thing I will do is reach up and turn a knob that selects 30,000 feet for my new target altitude.  This alone, however, isn't enough to command a descent.  I then have to tell the airplane how I want to get there.  In this case, because it is a small change, I likely reach up and instruct the aircraft to descend at 1,000 feet per minute.  Upon reaching 30,000 feet, the aircraft will automatically \"capture\" that altitude and stop the descent there.\n\nAs far as the scenario of a slumped over pilot, the autopilot will automatically disconnect with a certain amount of force applied to the control column.  I would say that it is possible that could cause the autopilot to disconnect, but you do need a decent concentrated force, so I don't think it is very likely.\n\nAgain, this information is specific to the aircraft that I fly, which is modern, computer-controlled airliner, but is not an Airbus like which is in question here.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13", "qSentId": 42442, "question": "so if the \"Terrain Pull Up...Terrain Pull Up\" alarm goes off, does the autopilot just keep on truckin'?

Also, I think I remember correctly, that the cockpit and cabin are not airtight from each other, so the pressure would soon equalise in any case. If there was explosive decompression in the cockpit (the front window blew out), then the lower pressure in the cockpit, would assist opening the door.\n\nHowever, if it is the case (as is reported), that the pilot in the cabin was banging on the door / trying to smash it down, then he will have almost certainly tried to use the emergency access procedure, which sounds an alarm in the cockpit, and must be *positively cancelled by someone in the cockpit* (i.e. a simply incapacitated person could not do it accidentally with any serious likelihood), or the door will open after a short delay.\n\nIf the pilot in the cabin could not gain entry this way, it is highly suggestive of either a SERIOUS failure of the door system (and of course, some other failure / illness / action, that caused the cockpit pilot to cause / allow a descent), or a deliberate action to keep him out of the cockpit (and thus presumably a deliberate crash). The full details of the CVR will hopefully shed much more light on this.\n\nHowever, there are plausible scenarios which could explain this, such as massive coincidental failures of multiple systems, but as always, the simpler scenarios should be ruled out first.\n\nTL;DR - Pressure unlikely to have prevented door opening, deliberate restriction of access to cockpit is indicated by current information.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13", "qSentId": 45165, "question": "This will turn out to be Muslims.", "aSentId": 45166, "answer": "Thanks Nostradickhead", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13", "qSentId": 45167, "question": "Thanks Nostradickhead", "aSentId": 45168, "answer": "Just you wait , well know soon enough.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13", "qSentId": 45169, "question": "Just you wait , well know soon enough.", "aSentId": 45170, "answer": "Agreed  ", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13", "qSentId": 45167, "question": "Thanks Nostradickhead", "aSentId": 45172, "answer": "wow, so civil.

But those two campaigns appear ready to become one", "aSentId": 49643, "answer": "This headline is quite a bit sensationalized - the US is not merging the two campaigns and is only entering this reluctantly.\n\nFirst of all, as a little background for a better understanding of what's going on there, basically what happened was that the Iraqi offensive, spearheaded by Shia militias coordinate by an Iranian general, stalled in Tikrit.\n\nThe Iraqis and Iranians did NOT want US air support and held out hope that they could take it without the US's help. From the article itself:\n\n&gt;Those forces had previously kicked off their operation to reclaim Saddam Hussein\u2019s from the self-proclaimed Islamic State without informing the U.S. military. But when that campaign stalled, they turned to American air power\n\n&gt;An American air strike campaign in Tikrit marks an important shift in the ISIS war. Iraqi officials did not engage their American counterparts before they launched the offensive on Tikrit March 1, with Iranian generals and tanks by their side.\n\n&gt;As Iraqi troop and militia deaths rose, more Iraqi politicans suggested they needed U.S. help. On Saturday, after receiving an official request from the Iraqi government, the U.S. and the coalition began providing videos and other intelligence learned from surveillance flights to the Iraqi military, as the Wall Street Journal reported and Army Col. Steven Warren, a Pentagon spokesman, confirmed Wednesday.\n\nBasically, the Shiite militias and Iran thought they could go-it alone. Turns out, that wasn't the case, so the Iraqi government has somewhat-reluctantly agreed to concede and ask for American help.\n\n&gt;\u201cThe Shiite militia leaders have been saying we don\u2019t need American air strikes so they have been pushing back on this idea. So there is going to be an internally debate within the Iraqi state,\u201d the adviser said.\n\n&gt;In his interview with Reuters, Massoum acknowledged that friction, but said: \u201cThe Iraqi government alone decides and no other force decides,\u201d referring to the Shiite militias.\n\nFurthermore, nowhere does it say the \"two campaigns are ready to become one\" besides in the headline - the US has long been ready to support *Iraqi Army* forces in securing Tikrit and Mosul. As in this case, it is only supporting the mission on the ground if the *Iraqi government formally requests it* \n\nWhy the reluctance? Because siding with one sect in this war and not the official government of Iraq is a dangerous precedence.\n\nNot all the Shia militias are the same, but some had nasty reputations in the sectarian conflict of the 2000s. And recently, in Tikrit and other towns, they were accused of perpetrating massacres and atrocities against the Sunnis, as revenge against ISIS.\n\nIn addition, the US *did* successfully organize Sunni groups like the Sons of Iraq during the war. However, the day after the last US troops left Iraq, Nouri al-Maliki issued an arrest warrant for the Vice President of Iraq, a Sunni, which re-triggered the Sunni-Shiite sectarian violence and took Iraq's violence levels way back up after having fallen to around pre-invasion levels in 2011.\n\nChoosing a side that is heavily sectarian is the last thing the US wants to do because it will likely only further fracture and divide Iraq, especially if the Shiite militias on the ground cannot be reined in, and it is largely only doing so now because the Iraqi government has come formally asking for help.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13", "qSentId": 49529, "question": "U.S. Ready to Back Iran With Airstrikes Against ISIS: Iran and the U.S. say they\u2019ve been fighting parallel wars in Iraq.

With batteries, you need to produce enough to store the entire sum of energy required for the trip.\n\nIt's a matter of scale. On a smaller scale batteries make more sense, on a larger one hydrogen fuel cell makes more sense. The cost of batteries scale linearly, whereas the cost of a hydrogen tank  and required fuel cell does not - it scales logarithmically (less than linear).\n\nDirect access to the power grid works in some scenarios, not in all.

It is a form of energy storage, not an energy source. Right now it is less efficient in terms of energy lost in processing than pure electric, via lithium ion batteries. \n\nIt does offer other advantages though. Hydrogen is vastly more energy dense per unit mass. And the net mass of the vehicle decreases as the fuel is spent - unlike batteries. It also does not require the production of 'disposable' (10 year life cycle) batteries.\n\nFrom where I sit battery electric makes more sense for small, land based vehicles - cars. Hydrogen makes more sense for aircraft, where mass is enemy #1. Especially low speed aircraft, where the large volume of the hydrogen tanks won't cause unacceptable drag issues. \n\nFor something like a train, I still think hydrogen makes more sense. Mass isn't really a concern, but neither is volume. And the cost of producing enough battery cells to power a train would be ridiculous.

A 1000 liter tank of compressed gaseous hydrogen has about as much energy as a 125 liter tank of gasoline. Or a 2000 liter battery array.\n\nSo, batteries are less energy dense by mass AND volume.

Use electrolysis instead of pumping water upstream and then throw it into trams if that suits the situation.\n\nEdit: since I can't really answer all of the flak I'm receiving, I just thought I would point out that it's good to have dissenting points of view. \n\nHonestly, I'm part of the Elon Musk fandom, I'm just also a fan of looking at a variety of options and of keeping minority opinions alive because they can (but don't always) produce fruitful alternatives. Is electrolysis worse than an ideal battery system where our cars automatically charge themselves when the grid needs somewhere to dump energy? No shit! Is electrolysis and hydrogen worth investigating more? Without a doubt in my mind.\n\n Here is an example of the Chinese doing just that, and I wanted to defend that investigation because the fact that so many of you would just shit talk it as something not worth pursuing is ridiculous to me.

Total lifecycle efficiency for batteries top 90% - hydrogen (between electrolysis, compression, storage, losses, etc.) is only about 25% efficient.\n\nhttp://phys.org/news85074285.html\n\nHydrogen requires a lot of complex technologies and moving parts. Electrolysis to generate the hydrogen, a compressor to compress it, storage tanks to store it (all of which require significant maintenance and testing)- then you need to transport it- in trucks or pipelines, and you need to store it at the station. When it catches fire- it burns with an invisible flame. Finally- you need an expensive and temperamental fuel cell to turn it back into electricity.\n\nMoreover- there is little that can be done to increase the capacity of a hydrogen storage tank- and while efficiencies of generation may get better- you're still left with all the other problems (compression, storage, transport).\n\nContrast that with battery technology. Battery capacity has increased by leaps and bounds and continues to do so. Supercapacitors and other technologies are being researched. Generation and storage of electricity requires no moving parts (solar panel + battery versus solar panel + electrolysis + compressor + storage tanks for hydrogen). You can already charge some of these batteries to 80% in 20 minutes. Couple that with battery swap stations and you've got hydrogen beat.

Well, this is currently a fun topic of debate in the fuel cell community. In Japan, they've started to implement \"on the spot\" filling where hydrogen is electrolyzed on demand so that the only storage is inside the car (or in this case, on the tram). You'd be storing water at the \"gas station\" instead of H2, meaning you get rid of a lot of the safety requirements. \n\nThe issue with this kind of H2 refueling is that electrolysis is generally a low pressure operation (400ish psi) and hydrogen is best stored (for volume reasons) at higher pressures. So, you'll either take a hit on how much hydrogen you can put in your car or you'll have to add a compressor (which requires a lot of power and isn't the safest thing). So there's been a good bit of work done in high pressure electrolysis (with some companies getting up to 5000psi).\n\nThe other option is that you store hydrogen somewhere to be transferred on demand - you electrolyze it in mass quantities (maybe powered by a wind turbine or solar, but any old electricity will do) and store it in tube trailers or large pressure vessels. This would be a quicker option of refueling, but there are codes about how much H2 you can store and what can be within 100ft of it and all that. \n\nBut then there are fuel cells that can run off of natural gas - they're called solid oxide fuel cells - they run so hot that they can internally reform methane into hydrogen. This solution is a) readily available and b) convenient but SOFCs are not the best at handling short bursts of power and are better suited to large scale steady power loads (like buildings).\n\nSo there's a lot of good stuff in this area and lots of possible solutions - time to start implementing and see what works and what doesn't!", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13", "qSentId": 51763, "question": "You have to generate electricity to electrolyze water to make hydrogen.

You can place a single 6 inch higher layer covering the whole bottom of the chassis like the Model S. But to get equivalent distance with the same horsepower hydrogen car you would need a minivan sized round gas cylinder on a trailer behind it. A similarly sized car that relied on hydrogen would have to be a two seater and get half the range.\n\nedit: And while a car that weighs less because it uses hydrogen will be more efficient to drive, you can always add more batteries and the extra weight will NEVER make an electric car less efficient than the losses you see in simply fueling the vehicle and using the fuel cell with hydrogen.

I am always happy to answer questions.  As far as the use in cars, we honestly aren't that interested in it.  We got out of the auto industry 10 years ago.  It was a good thing that we did because we are one of the few remaining companies left.  They made it clear to us that if we were going to play in the same sandbox, then they were going to take our lunch money every day and steal our homework and turn it in as theirs.   We chose not to play in that sandbox and do other things.\n\nA lot of H2 companies went belly-up and had their patents locked up in the process.  The auto industry robbed the H2 industry and we have the scars from it.  \n\nLuckily, all the patents are not being held onto any longer and you are going to see a lot of activity because the people who stole the patents no longer have control over them.  (we just signed over $80mil in patents to VW).\n\nThere is a lot that needs to happen to get H2 into cars and until we get solid partners in that industry, it won't happen.\n\nSolar is a great way of getting cheap(er) H2.  The only problem with solar is that it is unreliable in many areas.\n\nWe use methanol reformation.  Many of our customers already have easy access to methanol so that is the method that we chose to support them.  We are working on other methods for our products, but right now methanol is what pays the bills.  \n\nNot ignorant at all. We have a consistent power grid that almost always has more power than we ask of it.  Very seldom do we experience brown-outs, because the power is always there to support the people.\n\nSeveral of our customers have a grid that is constantly fluctuating and going out.  Sometimes there is X-amount of power, sometimes there is 1/X amount of power.  Sometimes none at all.\n\nBatteries may cut the mustard, but the charging strain can burn out the batteries quickly.\nWhen batteries charge, they consume constant_power to charge.  If the fluctuating grid drops below that constant_power charge rate, other power-consumption devices on that grid will drop out.\n\nIf charging is interrupted by a power outage, it causes strain on the battery.\n\nUnfortunately with the size of he batteries required for this mass, it requires a great deal of power to charge.  Because batteries charge Ata constant rate, the rest of the grid will fluctuate to accommodate that.  With the grid as fragile as it is, that charging will come at the expense of other resources.  If the grid goes down multiple times during a single-charge, the batteries become the casualty.  It is a teeter totter between strain on the grid and strain on the batteries.\n\nNot to say it is a guaranteed problem.... but it does add a dependency on an already unstable grid that is \"sketchy\".\n\n", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13", "qSentId": 51786, "question": "Didn't the British invent the first Glucose, Fat, Protein powered Pram?

That is when it causes more heat to be retained than before, but only after a rise in temperature first.\n\nIn other words, think of it like a secondary greenhouse gas.

However, this is only because whatever technology is packaged into a popular consumer product and commoditized is going to take the lead by leaps and bounds. With Tesla's new battery factory, I think plug-in electric cars will begin to have the advantage. Research and development are not free. This only happens at high speed with a supply of money that is unending from a critical mass of consumers that are eagerly buying each iteration of the product. \n\nI remember Jimmy Carter putting solar panels on the roof of the White House and then Ronald Reagan taking them off.

Or the Turkish genocide that General Andranik committed against Turks to purge and exterminate the land to create \"Greater Armenia\"? \n\nIt's not very hard for a bunch of little nations to blame a bigger nation for genocide and no one even asks you for evidence to prove it. Anyone questioning the genocide is ridiculed too for being heartless.\n\nLet's also discuss the hypocrisy of heroic Armenian fedayees (Armenian martyrs) in their role for WWI, while at the same time claiming they were crushed unfairly by the Ottomans in genocide:\n\n&gt;Our volunteers fought in the French Foreign Legion and covered themselves with glory. In the L\u00e9gion d'Orient they numbered over 5,000 and made up more than half of the French contingent in Syria and Palestine, which took part in General Allenby's decisive victory.\n\n&gt;In the Caucasus, without mentioning the 150,000 Armenians in the Russian Armies, about 50,000 Armenian volunteers under Andranik, Nazarbekoff and others, not only fought for four years for the Entente, but after the breakdown of Russia, they were the only forces in the Caucasus to resist the advance of the Ottoman Empire, whom they held in check until the Armistice was signed. They helped the British in Mesopotamia \n\nBoghos Nubar (Leader of the Armenians) (In January, 1919, The Times published a letter from Boghos Nubar (an Ottoman citizen) in which he protests, belatedly, about the non-representation of Armenians at the Paris Peace Conference, 1919)\n\nIt's incredible how the Entente Powers are never blamed for abandoning the poor Armenians and signing treaties with the Turks and not giving them their dream of \"Greater Armenia\". Or the Russians who fomented the rebellion of the Armenians only to abandon them in 1917.\n\nThis rebellion was no small thing, a force of 200,000 Armenians fought tooth and nail and captured many Ottoman cities and purged it of Muslims. The other Christians (Greeks, Assyrians) joined in the fight so that one day they too can have territory to rule over because they hate that Muslims ruled them and taxed them. But no one wants to hear that side of the story.\n\nThe Armenians at first didn't recognize the other Christian \"genocides\" mainly because they felt they were uniquely singled out by the Ottomans. Now they realize the more people blame the Turks, the better. Spreading hatred is their game, keeping old wounds open helps create an atmosphere of hatred. This is all these genocide accusations that lack evidence, ever accomplish. \n\nThere's a reason the world accepted the Nazi Holocaust (in 1940s) (including death camps, gas chambers, meetings to plan their extermination none of which exist for the Ottomans) instead of the Armenian genocide (1915), because there simply isn't any evidence to support an Armenian genocide. Plenty of counter-evidence such as the execution of Ottoman soldiers/officers who failed to protect Armenian subjects of the empire. \n\nThe fact that Western Armenians were relatively untouched and the Armenian patriarch (Armenian church leaders) stayed in the capital of the Ottoman Empire throughout the war and remained untouched. Just as Christians lived for over 600 years under Ottoman rule in relative peace (except when they rebelled). The Entente Powers even were quite selfish about their own religion, they asked the Ottoman leader \"Please do not forcibly relocate Protestant and Catholic Armenians. Do whatever you want with the Armenian Apostolic rebels.\" The Ottomans accepted but said that the hostile rebel villages must be relocated.\n\n**edit:** Armenian/Assyrian/Greek Nationalists would rather downvote and make 1-line accusations rather than actually discuss the evidence of intent. They even admit there isn't evidence of intent but claim \"number of deaths == genocide\", something you cannot possibly ever do. That's the opposite of the definition of genocide, that's called war. Or they claim \"photographs or witnesses\" indicate genocide, once again that is not evidence. A massacre is not a genocide unless there is intent to exterminate the group. A murder is not a genocide. A mass murder is not the same as genocide. We have different words for particular specific reasons. Genocide is intent to exterminate and dead bodies cannot prove that intention. That is not how the Holocaust was proven.

And based on what?  I think it would actually be extraordinarily difficult to prove a genocide based purely on physical evidence, because most genocidal organizations take steps to make destroy that evidence.  \n\n&gt; The German archives show plenty of evidence of Ottomans NOT harming the Armenians.\n\nDo you have proof of that?  Something as basic as the Wikipedia page for the Armenian genocide has several well-sourced excerpts from German sources saying, explicitly, that the Ottoman government wanted to exterminate the Armenians.  If you have evidence contradicting that, I'd be interested in seeing it.\n\n&gt; It cannot. These two clauses are logically contradictory. If someone didn't order killing of Armenians, then there was no systematic extermination.\n\nNo, they are not.  We don't need physical proof of an order from the upper reaches of the Ottoman government to conclude that  a genocide took place.  Here is the UN definition of genocide:\n\n&gt; ...any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:\n(a) Killing members of the group;\n(b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;\n(c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;\n(d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;\n(e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.\n\nOne of the most notable aspects of that definition is that it doesn't necessitate the destruction of **all** of a certain group-- so the fact that some Armenians weren't harmed, or that the Armenian patriarch didn't move, does not make genocide impossible.\n\nJust as importantly, the definition does not specify that the genocide had to be official, or even officially sanctioned-- merely systematic.  The presence of concentration camps, laws stripping Armenians of property, and forced relocations all suggest that the actions of the Ottomans were systematic.  The lack of an order to commit genocide does not preclude genocide from occurring.\n\nMoreover, what evidence we have of the events that took place meet three of the five acts that can constitute genocide.  To me, the case is inarguable.\n\nEdit:  You edited your post while I was writing my response.\n\n&gt; There were officials that did care. Officials that didn't care. The ones who neglected Armenians were EXECUTED on orders of the Ottoman leadership. \n\nAgain, I'll ask for proof, because the fact that 75% of the Armenians forced to make the journey to Syria died suggests that the number of officials that didn't care was much higher than the number of officials that did care, and also that a fair number of those officials that didn't care escaped execution.\n\n&gt; In genocide, you would exterminate people where they stand or at planned death camps\n\nNot necessarily.  The definition of genocide doesn't include anything about the manner of death of the people in question, and it doesn't do so for good reason: it would be very easy to perpetuate a campaign of extermination that used different methods of killing in order to escape being officially labelled a genocide.  How they were killed makes no difference; only the fact that they died as a result of systematic actions on the part of the Ottomans does.\n\n&gt; The term genocide originated... To describe the intended extermination of a people.\n\nYes, it did.  And the intended extermination to which the originator of the definition referred in his works was the Armenian genocide.  \"I became interested in genocide because it happened so many times. It happened to the Armenians, then after the Armenians, Hitler took action.\" -- Raphael Lemkin\n\n&gt; In fact, the British did the same exact thing in Malaya to stop communist villages but no one accused them of genocide.\n\nForced relocation, on its own, is a draconian measure that should arguably never be used.  Even so, what the Ottomans did went much further than what the British resorted to.  And, in any case, the fact that the British aren't accused of genocide has no bearing whatsoever on the merits of the Armenian genocide.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13", "qSentId": 55059, "question": "Are you saying it wasn't a genocide because they fought back?", "aSentId": 55072, "answer": "no he is saying it wasnt genocide since armenians tried exterminating turks but instead got their asses handed to them.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13", "qSentId": 55059, "question": "Are you saying it wasn't a genocide because they fought back?", "aSentId": 55074, "answer": "No I'm saying it wasn't genocide because in order for something to be genocide, you need to prove INTENT to destroy in whole or in part a group of people. \n\nYou do not have any evidence of intent. There was no centrally planned or systematic killings of Armenians by the Ottomans. There isn't a single document or speech expressing the will to kill innocent Christians or Armenians. There isn't a single order from Constantinople found saying \"kill men, women, children\". Therefore, as tragic as it may be that many Armenians died in WWI, it is not genocide.\n\nI mention the rebellions and WWI to show the context of WHY so many Armenians died (many Armenians died fighting with weapons in hand rather than victims of some genocide; others flee'd to the mountains when the Russians retreated, dying in the cold or from starvation). \n\nMany don't realize that the Armenians took great pride in fighting WWI as combatants.

It's that one wrong makes another wrong right, which sounds kinda horrific when you say it but is really an important philosophical sticking point. \n\nFor example, Israel firing at United Nations buildings is, in a void, wrong. But when Hamas chooses to violate morality and law by using what should be a shelter as a site to launch weapons, Israel's retaliation--the second wrong--is no longer wrong (goes the counterargument, which I agree with). There's a big difference between reprisal and vengeance, and most of the IDF's actions in the last Gaza conflict fell under the category of reprisals. \n\nIsrael should never be shooting at anyone out of uniform. After all, Hamas was at the time a part of government of the internationally recognized Palestinian State. This means their soldiers will be fighting in uniform, in accordance with international law, right? So attacking civilians when your enemies are clearly demarcated by uniforms would of course be a horrific crime! But of course, the Palestinians don't operate in uniform, so the Israelis *must* fire on people out of military uniform in order to engage the enemy (who is attacking the *Israeli* civilian population whom the IDF has an obligation to defend). \n\nI certainly don't think Israel can do no wrong--there's a lot of things they did in that war and continue to do know that I think are wrong.

Especially Mars for some reason. Damn planet is cursed and has a lot of failed probes that either didn't make it or died on landing. If you have a functioning multimillion dollar probe on Mars you use it for all its worth. When you factor in failure rates, costs and launch windows you can't send that many very often so you use what you have.
