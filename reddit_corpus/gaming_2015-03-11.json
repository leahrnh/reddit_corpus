You could have said this a decade ago but this is no longer true, and here's where you can make the argument that the PC gaming market is expanding.\n\nIf you go back 10-15 years, PC gaming was very much about pushing the bar for graphics and hardware. If you think about PC gaming of that era you'll think of Quake, Half Life, Crysis as key titles, cutting edge FPS games. You also saw the likes of Warcraft 3 / WoW / TF2 which at the time they were released would certainly have required a specialised gaming PC.\n\nNow that game budgets have increased dramatically, you don't really see the same sort of \"eye candy\" titles being created as PC exclusives, because the cost of creating such titles is now too high. Any titles with cutting edge visuals are inevitably created as console games, and the relatively low power of modern consoles means that system requirements for AAA games haven't increased very much over the last few years. Couple that with a steady increase in the power of integrated graphics found in off the shelf workstations and laptops, and the new business models for PC games which allow games to survive for long periods of time instead of requiring CoD style yearly updates, and the current landscape is a lot different.\n\nToday's PC gaming scene involves yesterdays games, which have survived because of their unique business models and style of play. WoW, Diablo, LoL, DotA2, TF2, CS together hold a gigantic chunk of the market.

It isn't even capable of 4k video. They don't have a hardware h.265 decoder, which means it would take a lot more powerful machine (we're talking i7 territory) to software decode. They can't use h.264 because the 4k video would be too large, at 100s of GB (probably an average of 350-400 GB per vid), and that would take days (minimum) to download, require wiping your hard drive, and you could only store one video at a time (some would be too large for you to store any). So no, you'll get neither 4k gaming nor 4k video on current hardware, even for the ps4/xb1, never mind the Wii U. In case you're wondering the current '4k' blu-rays are actually 'mastered in 4k'; they are 1080p, not 4k.\n\nEdit: overall, if we're thinking about the future, the Wii U will always have its niche place, but the only console that looks set to improve in terms of functionality and so on is the Xbox. With Microsoft setting up streaming just like steam and creating links with Windows, the XB1 is likely to see all sorts of benefits from (at least limited) access to the massive PC game collection to in-home distributed computing (i.e. using your gaming PC as a supplement to the XB1's hardware to improve performance). The ps4 was much better at launch but it's not got any advantages over a PC of the same price point.\n\nIn terms of local coop, PC games can often be run in multiple instances even if they don't. However, local coop is really kicking off on PC and has been for a while, just as it's dying on the consoles. Contagion, LC:GoL, Ibb and Obb, Hero Siege, Rayman (Origins and Legends), Mount your Friends, even the return of support for classic franchises like Worms - this is just a taste of what PC gaming has to offer in terms of local coop. Widespread support for controllers like the 360 gamepad and the rise of couch PC gaming were pretty significant in contributing to this. I recommend you investigate all of these if you've just built yourself a PC - they're all excellent. The best way we can encourage devs to start including local coop on PC is by buying the games that are out there and showing them it's a viable thing for the platform.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh03", "qSentId": 29879, "question": "The current console hardware isn't capable of 4k gaming and definitely never will be. It isn't even capable of 4k video. They don't have a hardware h.265 decoder, which means it would take a lot more powerful machine (we're talking i7 territory) to software decode. They can't use h.264 because the 4k video would be too large, at 100s of GB (probably an average of 350-400 GB per vid), and that would take days (minimum) to download, require wiping your hard drive, and you could only store one video at a time (some would be too large for you to store any). So no, you'll get neither 4k gaming nor 4k video on current hardware, even for the ps4/xb1, never mind the Wii U. In case you're wondering the current '4k' blu-rays are actually 'mastered in 4k'; they are 1080p, not 4k.\n\nEdit: overall, if we're thinking about the future, the Wii U will always have its niche place, but the only console that looks set to improve in terms of functionality and so on is the Xbox. With Microsoft setting up streaming just like steam and creating links with Windows, the XB1 is likely to see all sorts of benefits from (at least limited) access to the massive PC game collection to in-home distributed computing (i.e. using your gaming PC as a supplement to the XB1's hardware to improve performance). The ps4 was much better at launch but it's not got any advantages over a PC of the same price point.\n\nIn terms of local coop, PC games can often be run in multiple instances even if they don't. However, local coop is really kicking off on PC and has been for a while, just as it's dying on the consoles. Contagion, LC:GoL, Ibb and Obb, Hero Siege, Rayman (Origins and Legends), Mount your Friends, even the return of support for classic franchises like Worms - this is just a taste of what PC gaming has to offer in terms of local coop. Widespread support for controllers like the 360 gamepad and the rise of couch PC gaming were pretty significant in contributing to this. I recommend you investigate all of these if you've just built yourself a PC - they're all excellent. The best way we can encourage devs to start including local coop on PC is by buying the games that are out there and showing them it's a viable thing for the platform.", "aSentId": 29880, "answer": "I never said it was.

Everything started getting ported to PC, in many cases even if it was only on one console. All the games I've bought I've realized are from pre-2010 or sequels to exclusives from that time period. The first example that comes to mind is a series like Dead Rising, wherein the original game predated the seismic shift, yet all future installments have been on PC.\n\nI knew for a long time that PC gaming, even if it is in an unrecognizable form, is the future. Ironically, after finally playing a PS3 (I literally didn't even touch one until 2013ish) I've realized that the PS3 was the closest any console maker ever came to a Steambox. No bullshit requirement to pay to play online like Live, and you could actually upgrade the damn hard drive. I have a terabyte one in mine and I'm having a fucking blast playing PS2/3 games, but at the end of the day the future is in designing systems and games in the PC style, wherein a game has many graphics options that allow it to run on a scale of systems, and any given component can be easily upgraded using industry standards ala the PS3 using generic notebook harddrives.\n\nAt that point though, the console is not a thing. I get the appeal of the simplicity but a console is an antiquated concept nonetheless. Consoles come from a time when computers capable of equivalent games were SUPER expensive, and they were simplistically designed to do what they did without excessive cost. When you can build a PC for 600 that can be upgraded indefinitely the 400 dollar consoles are almost useless.\n\nAnd your Nintendo point is spot on. I've said it a million times myself, but people really gave them shit with the Wii Once again though, they proved to be thinking well ahead of the curve. They said from day 1 that competing with MS and Sony was a pointless battle, and they were right. When Sony and MS start to fail because they can't lock in players anymore and can't afford exclusives, Nintendo will still be kicking back because they've switched to an almost entirely first party platform wherein they make amazing products you have to go through them for. The time of the average gamer being afraid of opening their PC is at an end, and MS and Sony don't really have many cards left to play.
