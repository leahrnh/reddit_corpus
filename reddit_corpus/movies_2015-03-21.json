Ebert was a hack.  Siskel was the brains.", "aSentId": 3437, "answer": "Near me is one of the foremost video stores in the U.S., famous in its own right and rightfully so. Years ago, in the pre-Web age (and before paper costs soared), they used to print a thick annual listing of all their films (over 20,000 titles at the time, in over 200 categories), which included a lengthy introductory section about the long-term staff there and their own perspectives on film.\n\nEach one had a short bio, which included short lists of their favourite and most hated films. At least one film appeared on one person's favourites list, and an another person's hated list. Both people were equally respected by staff and customers alike.\n\nA person's opinion about a given thing, especially compared to your own, is not a valid basis for evaluating them as a person, or even evaluating their opinion. You're free to claim it is, and act accordingly, but that does not make it so. What makes someone's views valid or not is how they construct them -- what their reasons are, and their basis for their own evaluation.\n\nSiskel and Ebert often clashed because they had different ways of approaching films. Siskel tended to rate films on an objective basis, which he calibrated according to the society and culture around him. Ebert tended to rate films on what he perceived as their own terms, and the promises they make to the audience. Thus, a film like *Evil Dead 2* rated well, because it fulfils its promise to its audience and is true to its genre and premise, and delivers a little bit past that -- even though it's a pretty goofy movie no matter how you slice it, and about as far from Oscar material as it's possible to get and still play in regular cinemas.\n\nEbert's complaints about *Blue Velvet* were very specific, and he made them very clear. He felt that Lynch had failed to fulfil his promise to his own star, and that relevant parts of the film were unnecessarily gratuitous, in contrast to what he perceived to be the film's point and promise.\n\nOne can debate that forever, and FSM knows people probably will, but that's not relevant to whether that opinion makes Ebert or anyone else who didn't like the film less of a valid critic. It does not. You may disagree with his perception of the film, but it's an honest one, arrived at honestly and fully explained -- not a gut reaction made without thought or reason. That's all that any reviewer or critic owes anyone.

Years ago, in the pre-Web age (and before paper costs soared), they used to print a thick annual listing of all their films (over 20,000 titles at the time, in over 200 categories), which included a lengthy introductory section about the long-term staff there and their own perspectives on film.\n\nEach one had a short bio, which included short lists of their favourite and most hated films. At least one film appeared on one person's favourites list, and an another person's hated list. Both people were equally respected by staff and customers alike.\n\nA person's opinion about a given thing, especially compared to your own, is not a valid basis for evaluating them as a person, or even evaluating their opinion. You're free to claim it is, and act accordingly, but that does not make it so. What makes someone's views valid or not is how they construct them -- what their reasons are, and their basis for their own evaluation.\n\nSiskel and Ebert often clashed because they had different ways of approaching films. Siskel tended to rate films on an objective basis, which he calibrated according to the society and culture around him. Ebert tended to rate films on what he perceived as their own terms, and the promises they make to the audience. Thus, a film like *Evil Dead 2* rated well, because it fulfils its promise to its audience and is true to its genre and premise, and delivers a little bit past that -- even though it's a pretty goofy movie no matter how you slice it, and about as far from Oscar material as it's possible to get and still play in regular cinemas.\n\nEbert's complaints about *Blue Velvet* were very specific, and he made them very clear. He felt that Lynch had failed to fulfil his promise to his own star, and that relevant parts of the film were unnecessarily gratuitous, in contrast to what he perceived to be the film's point and promise.\n\nOne can debate that forever, and FSM knows people probably will, but that's not relevant to whether that opinion makes Ebert or anyone else who didn't like the film less of a valid critic. It does not. You may disagree with his perception of the film, but it's an honest one, arrived at honestly and fully explained -- not a gut reaction made without thought or reason. That's all that any reviewer or critic owes anyone. Your dismissal of it -- and of him -- merely because you happen to feel differently about the same thing is not a viewpoint worthy of respect in itself, since it's rooted entirely in subjective value with no qualification that you've supplied.

Yes, it's made up, and no, I have no idea what reasonable quantities are for these units of measurement. Deal with it.  \n&gt;I need to consume 43.2 liters of water per sol. I have to make it until sol 500, and today is sol 120. So that's 380 sols of water, for a total of 16,416 liters. Now, my water reclaimer can clear through 30 liters per sol, which means that across my 380 sols, I'll have to find some way to come up with 5,016 liters of water. If I overcharge the water reclaimer, I can make up to 4,500 of those liters, leaving me still 516 liters to magic up. The problem with that is that normally, it requires 400 kilowatt hours, but in order to get that increased output, it'll take 600 kwh. I can supply 1800 to the vehicle, but I need 1300 of those for the oxygen and ... so I'm still 100 kwh short.  \n\nSo on, and so forth.

Anything doesn't require a cohesive narrative.\n\n&gt; Alien. Blade Runner. Thelma and Louise, Gladiator (Best Picture), Black Hawk Down, American Gangster, etc.\n\nBlade Runner is overrated as well. I get that it's an important film in the way it's influenced science fiction but if we're talking about a lack of coherency Blade Runner takes the cake. It look 7 cuts of the movie and nearly three decades to make a somewhat coherent film out of it. The characters are flat and uninteresting aside from the incredibly hammy and over the top performances of the androids, the tears in rain speech is incoherent gibberish, the movie is boring as fuck, Deckard being a replicate makes no narrative sense and just feels shoe-horned in. The whole movie is a bunch of staff that seems cool on the surface but there's no real logic or meaning behind it. I mean, even the title is irrelevant. Scott bought the title to a different book because he thought it sounded cool. That's the entire movie in a nut shell. The movie has great production design but no heart. This is the case with all of Scott's movies. It only really works with Alien's cold, nihilistic horror. Scott feels like a slightly less robotic Nolan but with a shittier filmography. And don't even get me started on Gladiator. Even Ebert admitted it was a piece of crap.\n\n&gt; So then, Neil Blomkamp. He has two movies. One was incredibly driven by character and story, the second was studio garbage. He's 1 for 2. I don't know why you're using him as an example, because he's only made two movies.\n\nHe's made three movies, two of which were garage. Elysium and Chappie both suffered from terrible scripts with poor pacing and bad storytelling. He even admitted recently that he's not sure if he should be a directing movies. Case closed.\n\n&gt; 300 was revolutionary, and beautiful\n\nIt looked good, I'll give you that. However, the plot was paper thin and the characters feel like cardboard cut-outs. I'd hardly call the film revolutionary. It basically just reappropriated what Robert Rodriquez and Frank Miller did with Sin City a few year earlier but dumbed it down for the masses. Much like Scott with Blade Runner, Watchmen was a case of the director not understanding the material they were adapting. Watchmen looks identical to the pages of the comic but it's missing all the subtlety and nuance. Sucker Punch is the only Snyder movie I actually like but even that is riddled with problems. It feels more like a bunch of music videos loosely strung together than a movie. \n\n&gt; Absolutely. But how the fuck can you ding dongs just pretend that Michael Bay didn't provide us with Bad Boys, The Rock, Armageddon, and Bad Boys 2? Plus The Island was good/not bad.\n\nThe Island was horrendous. Bad Boys, The Rock and Armageddon are mindless popcorn films. Bad Boys 2 was terrible. It suffered heavily from pacing issues, as have Pearl Harbour and all the Transformers movies. He's got lucky with a few movies that haven't been completely terrible, which I guess happens when you rope in heavy hitters like Tarantino, Arron Sorkin and JJ Abrams to polish things up. But even writers of their caliber couldn't polish those turds completely.
