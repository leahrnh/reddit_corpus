During group work, many of them consistently submitted work that wouldn't have passed in any undergraduate class anywhere else - maybe not even in high school. As for the teachers - most of them were incredibly lax. The first couple of classes I really did my best to submit work that was to the best of my ability. When I started to realize that I could hand in literally anything and receive an A, the quality of my work started to drop quickly. Not my GPA though - that stayed high. I would say during my 12 classes, I only had one teacher who demanded quality work. \n\nI will say that by the time I left UoP, their attitude towards recruiting practices was changing drastically. Internal communication was all about enrolling quality students and moving away from the predatory practices that were used in the past. In believe that they are / were genuinely looking to become an institution that provides quality education and where students graduate and go on to be successful. I don't know how this is now. It's possible that their lower enrollment rate is due to them refusing to enroll students that are not ready or that they believe will not graduate. Then again, if that's true then we should see a higher graduation rate as a result, and I don't think that's the case.

So far, it's helped me do everything I want to do in life.  So here's my story.  I admit it isn't a normal one, but this is why I chose to do what I did.  When I was 18 I joined the Marines.  Eventually, I was medically discharged and started going to community college.  I did pretty well there for the most part, but at some point I had a depressive episode and dropped out.  \n\nI went to the VA Hospital, and they told me I probably have Type II Bipolar disorder and put me on meds.  I did not like these meds, so I decided that I'd learn more about how to mitigate my symptoms and get off them.  So I switched my degree to psych.  Problem was, it was still really hard for me to be around people sometimes, and I would constantly miss class due to depressive episodes.  My solution was to go to the University of Phoenix and do most of my schooling at home.  I studied hard, got good grades, and honestly gave zero fucks about what other students did in the class.  As I learned as much as I could and, I used the stuff I was learning to understand myself better, and it was cathartic and very much helped me with my bipolar.  \n\nI honestly feel like I got a decent education, but I will also admit that I generally tend to teach myself.  This system worked well for me, but I don't think it does for everyone.  Also, I have my GI Bill, so I'm not in debt.  \n\nThen after I got my degree, I had the predicament everyone was talking about trying to find a job, and it was discouraging.  The bigger problem was, I had no idea what I even wanted to do.  I *wanted* to be a Marine.  I was good at it until I got hurt, and I got my psych degree for more personal reasons.  So I decided eventually to join the Peace Corps.  \n\nIt was something I considered even before the Marines, but I needed a degree.  Now I had one.  I applied, had an interview, and then fell off my fucking motorcycle causing me to have to withdraw my application.  I was qualified for youth development because of my psych degree, plus I had been a coach.  But the recruiter said that I seemed like a good candidate to be an English teacher if I just got certified in teaching English (since my degree wasn't in English.)  So I applied to a program at UCI and got my TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) certificate and applied to the Peace Corps again.  I've recently been invited to serve as an English Teacher in Mongolia, and will be departing in a couple months.  \n\n**TL;DR:**  University of Phoenix has worked out well for me so far.

They were the #1 retailer of cell phones in the US for many years, and that's what paid for them to expand nearly everywhere.\n\nUnfortunately, now that all cell phone companies have their own stores, they're no so desperate for third party sales so the commission is much lower. And most plans are renewals they would get anyway now. Not to mention radioshack made the mistake of expanding to way too many stores. Combine that with the fact that they ignored their original customer base for a long time, didn't stock actual electronics, and charged an absurdly greedy margin for things you can get cheaper practically anywhere, and they hemorrhaged all their money.\n\nIt's sad, because before they went under, they actually did EVERYTHING that people keep saying they should have done, a lof ot their stores are packed with hobby kids, 3d printers, electronic parts, repair stations, makers kits, and etc. But everyone's just assuming they do nothing but phones, and I suspect the do-it-yourself electronics scene just isn't big enough to support a national chain.\n\nSource: Also worked there for a little while, and I go there a lot (but almost never buy anything because it's all to expensive.)", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l", "qSentId": 15476, "question": "Worked a stint at a RadioShack once.

Berkshire is actually an owner in Heinz. With Restaurant Brands International (BK-TH), he is *sort of* a bond holder. His coupon on the bond is 9%.

Apparently the officer was tortured almost immediately and for several straight days. The POW had yet to have been tortured because the interrogator had basically been able to relate to him, and didn't think the POW had any useful information.

We call this phenomenon, in which you accuse me of faults you are yourself exhibiting, \"projection.\"\n\nYou have either not noticed or completely ignored my requests for you to define why the parents' worthiness of sympathy or benefit ought to be dependent on the worthiness of their son. Since that was my initial and central point, reiterated in each of my responses, and you still haven't addressed it head on, it is your own conversational ability that ought to be questioned, not mine.\n\nAs for your hypothetical - if you had been in that situation, you would have been angry for the same general reasons you are being angry already? That's not exactly a compelling hypothesis. The fact that you would have been angry in that scenario does not mean that your anger would have been justified. And it's not like I had failed to consider the feelings of friends and relatives already. I had done so, and concluded that their anger at an act of kindness toward the parents, like yours, would have been unjustified.\n\n\n&gt;Run along now. Adults are talking here.\n\nIf you *are* an adult, which I find doubtful given your atrocious behavior, it is only by virtue of having aged like everyone else. That's hardly a glorious accomplishment, given that you appear to have failed to learn civility or wisdom despite your alleged years. Constantly talking down to other users, especially ones who are simply advocating that individuals be judged on their own merits, is not a badge of maturity.\n\nEDIT: P.S. - if your next response doesn't actually address my point, or is as uncivil as your last few, I will simply ignore it.

How reliable is a military that can arbitrarily decide that it's done serving?\n\nIf *your* country were under attack, how would you feel about *your country's* military forces saying \"nope, not gonna get killed...I quit\"?\n\n**That** is why desertion is seen as a bad thing: if you can't count on your soldiers being available when you need them, you don't have a military.  Note that this *isn't just a wartime problem*: if your military is called upon to help during natural disasters or another humanitarian crisis, the problem is just as great.\n\nNow, as for.... \n\n&gt; If someone decides they no longer want to participate in an army that kills and tortures people...\n\nFirst, service in the United States military is **voluntary.**  Unlike other countries that rely on conscription to fill the ranks, everybody in the U.S. military has joined of their own free will.\n\nSecond, members of the U.S. military may refuse an unlawful order (e.g. \"shoot that unarmed man\").  One can argue the merits and impartiality of the subsequent process (investigation and court-martial), but at *worst* the individual has refused to participate in an illegal action and will be discharged from the service.  At best, the illegal activity is brought to light, the responsible parties will be charged with a crime, and the individual is not punished.\n\n&gt; All this defense of a military state is really unnerving \n\nIt's not about \"defending a military state\", it's about Bergdahl *breaking his oath* to serve **and** that other military personnel were endangered and  (according to some sources) *killed* in the search for him.\n\n", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l", "qSentId": 19128, "question": "That someone--sitting behind a desk in some heated and air-conditioned office somewhere--has decided to charge Bowe Bergdahl with desertion, is despicable. When a man who has realized that he has been ordered to carry out horrible violence in order to advance someone's political career; and that man walks off of a US base in Afghanistan without his weapon and gear, he is not deserting. He is attempting suicide. Bowe Bergdahl had no reason to think that he would ever leave Taliban hands with his head still connected to his body. He had no reason to think that a member of the Taliban would believe any information that he said claimed to possess. In fact, he had no reason to think that he would ever survive being see by the enemy, let alone be able to come within earshot of a Taliban fighter who spoke English. \n Maybe, by whatever insane logic led someone to believe that Bergdahl should be tried for desertion, the Army should try every attempted suicide with desertion. And every completed suicide, too. While we are at it, why not try every soldier who dies as a result of combat wounds with desertion. \n Trying Bergdahl for desertion is a shameful chapter of the U.S. Army's history. Yet, with bad and worse calls like these being made every day, the Army still can't understand the suicide epidemic that it has fostered in recent years. Soldiers see these incompetent leaders every day, at every level. The private sees it in Sergeants and Corporals who, having no integrity, take credit for the work and ideas of their subordinates. The Sergeant sees it in his Platoon Sergeant, who falsifies the result of PT tests play favorites with his soldiers. It is seen in a Sergeant Major of the Army who commits vehicular assault to silence a female soldier, the soldier who is the key witness in the sexual assault investigation being conducted against him. It is seen in the Battalion Commander who's daily unprofessional conduct weighs down the morale of every officer, NCO, and soldier who found himself under her haphazard and arbitrary command. It is seen in every piss-poor manager, I won't say leader, who won't risk so much as a hang-nail to their career in order to do the right thing. \n If the Army really wants to get to the bottom of the suicide epidemic, they need get to the bottom of the shitty leader epidemic. They need to raise leaders who are able to inspire soldiers, not just coerce them. But, if the Army's goal is to destroy trust and morale, hollow out the force, and punish those who need help, then by all means, charge Bergdahl.", "aSentId": 19129, "answer": "You think his fellow soldiers support him?

In many circles, maybe not in mass media, this is a simple gauge. I know its not absolute or widely accepted.\n\nThis article really seems like a kind of straw-man (is that a target for ironic anti-pc rage?) attack. \n\nDid you guys know that as late as 1975, in some states if a woman wanted a credit card they had to get permission from their husband? \n\nDid you know that in some states, as late as 2005, there was no definition for marital rape?

I mean, think of just about any group and we could all point out some crazy fringe behavior: from gamers, to anarchists, to hippies, to neo-cons, to atheists, whatever. \n\nI am just suggesting, and I am aware that I could be accused from other feminists of being presumptuous, that to my knowledge, jazz hands would not be the bread and butter of the movement. \n\nI once worked for a cabinet making company owned and operated by a woman.

So You brought up a few topics. I'm a little confused by some of your questions so you might have to clarify. I don't understand the hippie drum circle.  Are you thinking that I'm justifying the weird jazz hands thing? I was pointing out that a group of people promoting jazz hands should probably not be conflated with \"feminism.\" \n\nLike, for example, I am a progressive preschool teacher. We don't use corporal punishment. The school is based largely on play. But some people conflate our approach with wild crazy kids or a hippie school. But is actually very structured. But there are crazy people that call themselves \"progressive\" and breastfeed until their kid is 7 or let them poop in the yard because they don't want to \"impose their authority over the child's natural spirit.\" \n\nAs far as the image of feminism, I'm not sure if I would say defending.

I was pointing out that a group of people promoting jazz hands should probably not be conflated with \"feminism.\" \n\nLike, for example, I am a progressive preschool teacher. We don't use corporal punishment. The school is based largely on play. But some people conflate our approach with wild crazy kids or a hippie school. But is actually very structured. But there are crazy people that call themselves \"progressive\" and breastfeed until their kid is 7 or let them poop in the yard because they don't want to \"impose their authority over the child's natural spirit.\" \n\nAs far as the image of feminism, I'm not sure if I would say defending.

In many circles, maybe not in mass media, this is a simple gauge. I know its not absolute or widely accepted.\n\nThis article really seems like a kind of straw-man (is that a target for ironic anti-pc rage?) attack. \n\nDid you guys know that as late as 1975, in some states if a woman wanted a credit card they had to get permission from their husband? \n\nDid you know that in some states, as late as 2005, there was no definition for marital rape? Personally, I don't feel that marriage justifies rape. So, as a feminist (I am male) I would say that that should be illegal.

I don't think women need to hear, \"women don't build things,\" from their dad or anybody. I think that is a feminist position.

Probiotics have some potential benefits but not to the extend that some people claim. Lactobacillus rhamnose for example has been shown to have some benefit, but doesn't remain in the gut for more than 48 hours. If you aren't taking large doses of L. rhamnose every day you won't see any benefits.

We've gained a huge amount of insight into these interactions but very few realistic treatments have resulted.

And my family is mostly southern white. \n\nTazers opened up problems because cops either think they're magical disabling devices and use them without the proper hesitation (they should be treated as above the escalation for proper use of a baton) or cops never want to use them because of the risk of missing, either with prongs being guided improperly or not penetrating clothing, or even a person being unphased by the shock to any significant extent. \n\nIt's creates a weird liability barrier where when someone dies from a baton beating it's direct police brutality but if someone dies from a tazer it's a combination of corporate liability in civil court, and a reduction of that liability because of the \"public policy\" of ensuring a market for tazers to cops.\n\nMost cops are good, I know this. But despite my \"favored complexion\" I have the same fears that cops are trained to have for things as minor as traffic stops. I worry about retaliation because he's (usually he) is worried about retaliation, and vise versa. I'm only genuinely at ease when I see a brown uniform in my state because the Sheriffs are largely without fault or unresolved controversy here. \n\nIt begs questions about the type of training and standards cops have, the extent of immunity they get (which is literally [and I use this word correctly based on the case law precedent] the tort and criminal liability of 6-9 year olds), and the very concept of grand-jury indictment and the extent that prosecuting attorneys have a conflict of interest. \n\nIn the latter, you're dealing with a man or woman who is in the courthouse often, which is typically in close proximity to a police department and/or jail, and is on a first name basis with multiple LEO's from interaction with bailiffs, other security, and whenever cops are called in for evidence on other matters. I can understand, though not excuse, why the prosecutor would try to paint a brighter picture for a LEO defendant. \n\nWe talk about militarized police but based on my german-side's experience with stationed MP's, police with actual military discipline wouldn't be a problem, if not an actual blessing. The problem is that they're pseudo-military. Germany has GSG-9, we have Favela-raid squads that we call \"SWAT\". And now a fraction of all officers have some localized accreditation that is compared to \"SWAT\": various arm badges and insignias indicating they belong to the \"tactical division\" of some bumble county or nondescript township/city - complete with some aggressive-looking predator animal wielding a gun/knife/arrows that looks like a Call of Duty player emblem.\n\nI think the problem is a culture that is fostered by legal shortcuts, inspired by nostalgia of the classic friendly neighborhood officer and fears of inefficient policing. Some cities do a good job improving it, but it would go a long way if we changed the criminal justice system to allow an outside attorney for the special circumstances of prosecuting cops. A merge of civil and criminal litigation to let the attorney that would otherwise represent the allege victim/victim's family present evidence to a grand jury without objection from a prosecuting attorney without good cause. \n\nThings like better training would simply follow suit from this, I'd worry any direct training \"reform\" would just make things worse. Maybe then we could naturally be rid of this meme of shock when a LEO is actually convicted of a violent crime and actually held to at least close to the same liability if a \"civilian\" did the equivalent.

That is why you wouldn't see a business owner get flack for refusing service to a member of a hate group. People have also been trying to get the Westboro Baptist Church under the same category of hate group. HOwever, the different between them and the KKK is that, so far at least, they have not been violent but just simply speaking their stance. And here we are, when a conservative christian refuses to partake a service to gays, it is out of HATE and discrimination for something they have no say or control over. Thus why it is immoral, and should be illegal.
