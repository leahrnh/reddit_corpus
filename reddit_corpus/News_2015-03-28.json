They do overwork and understaff. As a cashier you would not only be cashier, but also restock and recover (pull to the front of the shelf), answer any question a customer might have at any given moment, and prevent theft by keeping one eye on the camera screen (positioned DIRECTLY over my head, so good luck with that), one on the cash register (so I can interact with the customer), one on the door for shoplifters going out and customers coming in, and one on your rolltainer (cart for product to be stocked) to make sure you don't fall behind on stocking! I don't have that many eyes...\n\nMy store was in a rougher part of town as well, but had no alarm system on the door for stolen products. We CONSTANTLY had \"pro\" shoplifters who knew how understaffed it was and would use this to play the store (two women with 5 kids come in. The women have large purses. They split up. The women call to each other about \"product x\", which was actually code for \" worker near you\". They leave after shoplifting and you can't stop them \"because you have to see them take the item\").\n\nAlso DG also typically has 2 to 3 employees working at a store, but with my store it was one cashier and one manager on duty. Two people to take care of a large store. When the truck to stock the store came, it was one cashier minding the entire store because the manager had to witness unloading of said truck. Makes it difficult if you need a manager for any reason (cash register error that ONLY the manager can unlock and redo for example).\n\nDG has VERY unrealistic expectations of their employees. It's just not possible to take care of a store like that when you have so much to do (I forgot to mention the cleaning as well). They treat their employees like crap: they blame most theft on employees (yeah, cause customers don't shoplift /s), and the turnover is astonishing. I had to leave because the stress and unrealistic expectations were just too high. Not worth the teensy tiny check you get.

To begin with, while Reddit does have its own board and a measure of financial independence, it isn't truly an independent company, being largely owned by Advance Publications. That fact, coupled with what we know of Reddit's finances generally would suggest that they're not well positioned to go on an acquisition spree. \n\nMy natural assumption would've been that they brought her on to raise capital, given her VC background and extensive connections to wealthy investors (in part through her now scandal-ridden husband). After all, in October 2014, Reddit just took on a $50 million infusion from tech investors (and a couple of celebrities). Of course, she was made interim CEO in November 2014, which throws a bit of a wrench into that theory. Perhaps it is because she has experience dealing with VCs and maintaining investor relations that she was chosen right after a funding. Perhaps the search preceded the closure of funding and they wanted to bring her on board to help secure the cash infusion or line up alternate investors if the deal fell through. Perhaps they anticipate future rounds of fundraising and know that she'd be well-equipped to handle that if they need more money before they permanently fill the role of CEO. Or perhaps they hired her with an entirely different focus in mind.\n\nIn truth, however justifiable her termination from Kleiner Perkins was, and however horrible she's revealed herself to be as a person, on paper she makes for a pretty decent CEO candidate for a company like reddit. BS in Electrical Engineering from Princeton, JD and MBA from harvard, Junior Partner at Kleiner Perkins, and a board member at a successful social media startup (Flipboard).

", "aSentId": 18738, "answer": "The argument, as I understand it, is two-pronged.  \n\nFirst, that the barrier to entry is different for different people, therefore equivalent outcomes from two different people (or two different teams) may represent a different amount of effort put in to get to that point.  In the abstract, this is decent point but when the conversation rolls into \"why?\" and \"what to do about it?\" everything turns into drama, and every step along the chain in the conversation you'll find more and more room for disagreement.  \n\nThe most vocal discussions on the cause of different starting positions are non-coincidentally the progressive hobby-horses of racial, sexual, and other bias and discrimination.  Once those points are brought up, they're used as a gateway to wedge the larger body of existing progressive political narrative into the conversation. The existing narratives make broad assertions about the presence of, causes of, and types of bias/discrimination in various facets of the software industry.  Challenging any of those points are wormholes to arguments that have been raging for years.  \n\nAside from all that, when you get to the \"what to do about it\" end is of the conversation, it turns out to be another minefield.  Generally speaking, the evaluation criteria for a piece of software are largely based around functionality, licensing, and support.  The evaluation criteria for a prospective employee are their abilities. Discrimination on factors such as race/sex/etc are largely considered irrelevant to job performance, morally wrong and often illegal. This is where the conversation becomes the regular fights that you're probably already familiar with.\n\nThe other prong of the meritocracy fight is some people see \"meritocracy\" as meaning more than software and their creators are judged on merit.  It means the authors of that software deserving and entitled. It means that the people who don't author open source code are deemed without any merit in the hiring pool, and... Well, you'll have to forgive me for trailing off here. I never really understood this part of the argument so I can't explain it.

A career in the field also almost always requires post-grad qualifications which is expensive and still no guarantee of higher earning power.  \nAlso failure rates are much higher in STEM which does indicate higher difficulty.\nYes if your very talented and driven you can do well but for the average student its a bad career choice. If immediate employment isn't an issue for you or your brave enough to take the risk, well you are very lucky and I'm quite envious really. But for most people, its not option(even though a lot of them still opt for it) And math and coding isn't all that bad if you look at it the right way and nor are they the only practical degrees. Accounting, more hardcore business degrees, are all great.

Those men get those jobs based on remarkable programming or engineering ability, and great women should get those jobs the same way.

KPCB's brand of \"peer review\" performance evaluation allows anyone to write a review on anyone, and as a senior partner, he presented himself as having a high degree of credibility. \n\n&gt; Not having sex with co-workers is a pretty basic rule for anyone who cares about their carreer, because the resulting shitstorm after the breakup is inevitable and completely foreseeable.\n\nGenerally, I agree. \n\nHer claim seems to be that he used his power (in KPCB's \"peer review\" performance evaluation system) to pressure her to have sex. I believe her, because perverted men on power trips are the norm at high levels in Silicon Valley. That said, she probably should have had the foresight to realize that sleeping with him a few times would only delay his retaliation until after she ended the relationship, and therefore elected *not* to sleep with him and to keep her credibility intact. \n\nShe was probably hoping that he'd lose interest in her after a few sexual encounters, and chase some other hot, young thing after \"conquering\" her. That didn't happen. \n\nWith John Doerr as her mentor, she was dealt a great hand. So long as she had him on her side, capitulating to Mr. Nazre was an absolutely terrible move, because she had a credible ally who could shoot him down. So it would have been best for her *not* to sleep with him, thereby keeping full credibility and allowing her mentor to intervene. \n\nIf Nazre made an explicit professional threat, then she would also be able to legally record him. While California is an all-party state (i.e. you can't record a conversation without the other person knowing) in general, extortion is exempted and, in such cases, it is legal to record the other party without his knowledge. That would have been a better move than capitulating, fucking him three times, and hoping the problem would go away after the perv lost interest (which didn't happen). \n\n&gt; If someone's case in court requires them to paint thenselves as a dumbass with no foresight, no ability to check basic facts, and as a helpless victim of powers beyond their control or understanding, it'll be hard to push the opposite idea that they're a hardened VC investor.\n\nSo, I would tend to agree. That said, they're completely different games. It's easier to vet businesses than the personal lives of people you work with. It's also very difficult for us to know, for sure, what was happening. How much pressure did Nazre put on her? What was said, and why did things happen as they did? We'll never know the answers. This is why having strong opinions of public figures' personal lives is a bit silly. We really don't know, for sure, what was going on or what was in her head. \n\nEven if she did know that he was married, for example, it's not legally relevant. Is it sleazy to knowingly sleep with a married person? Sure. Does it have any bearing on whether KPCB committed a crime? Nope. Even while you could argue that knowingly sleeping with a married man shows poor judgment and character that *might* be grounds for termination, you'd have to establish that a man who made the same mistake would get the same punishment, which is not true in most organizations. Firms typically look the other way on non-work-related sexual immorality in men, so punishing it in women would still be discriminatory.

Because (and I truly hope this never happens to you) one day you may be accused of committing a crime. Even if the entire world is shouting your guilt from the rooftops, the cops, the prosecutors, judges, reporters, bloggers, even friends and family all want your head on a pike; your lawyer will have your back and work tirelessly to get you off the hook, or at least minimize your punishment. Because if he doesn't, if you or someone else finds out that your lawyer is hindering or sabotaging your defense because he \"knows\" you're guilty, and doesn't want to work a \"dishonest job\", then you would be well within your rights to fire him, odds are he would lose his license too.\n\nSo don't knock lawyers for doing their job, because their job is part of what holds our justice system together.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l", "qSentId": 22099, "question": "Don't blame the lawyer, he is just doing his job.

They must also get a release waiver, not from the police officer, but from \"any person who is filmed interacting with a law enforcement officer\" i.e. private citizens being arrested.  Most production companies already do the release part.  It sounds like Montana wants to make sure that the state makes a little money when these shows are filmed, and that the police departments retain editorial control.  At least in my reading, this has nothing to do with citizens who film cops on duty because the citizen is not employed by a production company.  And it does not apply to journalists unless they are doing a ride-along because they are not \"accompanying\" the officer.

One hundred percent. Everyone deserves to be able to get married, and find love, and have children, and I don't give a goddamn who they do it with. I love that America is making this possible for people, finally, and I love seeing these couples finding the happiness that they deserve.\n\nI also believe in religious freedom. Let me clear up what may be a misconception about what this bill does. It forbids the government from forcing people to act against their religious beliefs unless there is a substantial interest and no other way of achieving it. This does NOT allow waiters to not serve homosexuals, or parking attendants to refuse to park their cars, or anything else. It only stops the government from forcing people to bake wedding cakes for gay marriages, or to hold weddings in their for-profit chapel, or their church. In other words, it forbids the government from forcing people to participate in a gay marriage against their convictions.\n\nThis IS a religious freedom issue, and this HAS been an issue in several high profile cases recently, which is why this protection is being enshrined in law. And I know many of us non-religious people can't understand it, but people have the right to practice their religion in America, and I'd like it to stay that way. I sincerely hope that religions can adapt to gay marriage, but that's their call, not the government's.\n\nPeace and love to my friends in the gay community, who are understandably hurt by this.

The new book paints him as someone who softened considerably with age and although he had a selfishness and a knowledge of his own greatness, it was not the full picture. Just like every other human being he was complicated (I'd add in that the book also illustrates several examples of Bill Gates showing similar characteristics in his youth with his employees. He could be extremely harsh too). \n\nOne anecdote in the book was that one time he (Steve) was at a benefit dinner where he had given a cheque for $5000. The founders asked him for advice and he went off on one for 15 minutes, telling them everything they were doing wrong and how they needed to change everything. It got so bad that he had to be asked to leave. 30 minutes later, one of the founders goes outside and finds Steve crying in his car. Steve says he doesn't know why he acted like that and that he'd like to go in, apologise and leave. \n\nAnother anecdote was that the author of the book was a writer for Fortune and had known Steve for 25 years. During a trip abroad the author got meningitis and Steve, although helping with his hospital care, decided not to give him stories for Fortune anymore. It pissed the author off. Weeks before his death, Steve called the author and asked him if he'd like to go for a walk and a chat (basically a goodbye chat). The author (not knowing that Steve was close to death) chewed him out for treating him so badly with the Fortune stuff. Steve was in shock, went silent for a minute and then sincerely apologised. He asked him to go for the walk anyway but the author never got around to it. He said he deeply regretted not going on that walk. \n\nSo what I'm saying is that Steve Jobs was a complicated man often lacking in self awareness. He expected you to push back against him and if you didn't he didn't think you were worth bothering with. It wasn't wilful cruelty. It was him getting sucked up into his own reality distortion field. \n\nThe thing that Isaacson's book didn't do was provide context or show this man as a human. Isaacson chose a view for the book (one that I don't necessarily disagree with) and he decided that was going to be his conclusion. But that conclusion is not the full story and I personally think the \"he was a bad guy\" \"he was a good guy\" books and opinions are worthless. Steve was just like the rest of us.

As such, the First Amendment applies to OH. A number of legal commentator, including the ACLU, have stated that the University likely did violate the expelled students' 1st Amendment rights (although other commentators have pushed back).\n\nBut, I think that is besides the point. I think every University, public or private, should strive to uphold the ideal of free speech enshrined in the First Amendment regardless of whether the law is applicable to the school.

Rather, my point is that the University's rules should, as a matter of principle, conform to the ideal of free speech as envisioned by the first amendment.\n\n\"Freedom of speech is not freedom from consequences of said speech.\"\n\nYes, I agree 100%. I think it is ridiculous when people cry \"Free speech\" when they are vilified, boycotted, or protested for their views. I am fine with those students being ostracized by their peers and lambasted in the press for their chant. That being said, I think a University should not be expelling individuals for their racist views. \n\nNow, I am not trying to defend the frat boys. I think that their chant was repulsive and indefensible. But the ideal of free speech is meaningless if it only serves to protect popular speech. Further, I think a University's mission should be to educate it's students. The expelled students are the exact people that the University should be striving to teach. Not everyone comes to college, at 18, with an enlightened world view. But we hope that four years of higher education can help erase ignorance and impart some wisdom and reason. I believe that expelling those students represents the University failing in it's mission to educate young adults.\n\nThis is all my opinion. I'm not arguing that the University was technically wrong or violated some law by expelling the students.
