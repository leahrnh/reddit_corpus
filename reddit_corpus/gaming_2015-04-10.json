W1, you click at the end of your animation to start the next animation. Guess what you do in W2. Go ahead.\n\nThe combat is cited as a negative BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WERE FED BY GAMING JOURNALISTS. Everything about W2 people learned from reviews. Especially given how many more people played W2 than W1. They were told \"Don't play W1, it sucks.\" and so they bought W2 and went \"awww yeah this is great\".\n\nW1 is better than W2. The game itself is tons longer, which is its own huge plus for W1. Past that, the voice acting choices are so much better and bolder than W2. Most returning characters sound bland and boring compared to their W1 counterpart. The music in W1 is one of the best soundtracks of all time, W2 falls short there easily. And W2 really hurt itself by splitting Chapter 2 into two parts. It's a fun and novel idea for sure, but it ends up hurting the game's length.\n\nW2 is a fun side story to W1, but the comparisons are bullshit made up by video game reviewers mad at W1 for being PC-only.\n\n(Didn't appreciate importing my W1 save only to have the W2 story shit on my choices to keep the game in line.
