Somewhere marketing groups found that an honest $10 price tag resulted in less sales than the more attractive looking $9.99. Same logic goes for not including tax on the actual price of the item; they don't want to do anything to deter you from making a purchase. Now you might be thinking: \"That doesn't work on me!! I'm a smart shopper and I know $9.99 is actually $10!! Duh!!\". This may be true, but if the lower price tag sells them just 3 more per store per day than the higher one, and the company owns 1000 stores that's 3000 extra units a day, 90,000 extra units a month and over 1,000,000 extra units a year which adds up to a lot of money for shareholders.

And then if you've transported these catapults from somewhere else, or your siege camp, you've also got to transport the roof.\nShould you not have already constructed the roof prior to the rain you now have to go and cut down some trees or use your existing lumber to then create a set of roofs, and manage to set them up properly in the mud. All this time your catapult is sat out in the rain and likely going to absorb all the water it could anyway. \nAnd if we're in such a desperate situation as to need cover in the rain, rather than hold the siege off until the rain ends, then getting a catapult to stop in order to erect a 10+ foot tall roof would be incredibly disruptive.\n\nAnd then I suppose finally, having a 10-foot tall roof sticking up above your siege engines just gives away their exact position for any counter-siege weapons used against you.

Not only did his royal wife like her finery, but he had had to buy his brother out of his share of the inheritance of Leicester and he had sworn an oath to go on Crusade.

Everything seems dandy between the two, and fast-forwarding to 1247 Henry installs de Montfort as royal lieutenant in Gascony, an English territory of France.  The earl is a little overzealous though, and his heavy-handed tactics piss off the Gascon lords; as a result he is tried before the king in 1252.  Although he is found innocent, this is the end of his friendship with the super-religious Henry - at some point in the trial de Montfort questions the king's devotion before his greatest nobles.  When the earl is finally removed from Gascony in 1254, Henry has this to say to his old friend:\n&gt;\"I never repented of any act so much as I now repent of ever having permitted you to enter England, or to hold any land or honours in that country, in which you have fattened so as to kick against my authority.\"\n\nNow comes the big break.  In 1258 de Montfort leads several other armoured nobles before the king and demands that a group of his French favourites (who have been allowed to act with impunity) be removed from court and the realm in general.

The royalists, who had refused to negotiate before the battle, were now forced to make concessions or see their prisoners executed.  Edward himself and a cousin were handed over to de Montfort for imprisonment, and Henry III effectively became a puppet king; the real power was in the hands of the earl of Leicester and the other barons.\n\nIn the next year many of the barons became disillusioned with de Montfort's rule and began to suspect him of trying to further his own ambitions rather than restore the kingdom to peace and plenty.  Many defected to the royalist cause, and on 28 May 1265 Prince Edward escaped his captors.

Really only until *recently* was the picture of a battle \"well\" recorded. Stretching further back in history we find fewer and fewer sources of information for how battles worked. Some very important battles in history are understood barely beyond \"Two armies met. There was a fight. One army ran away.\"\n\nYes, we may know grand strategic manoeuvres; they marched north, wheeled around  the woods and set up atop the hill, the opposing army pushed east and met then on the long side of the valley. Their cavalry broke early and skirmished to the west before pulling back, the infantry attacked and held until the nobles encircled the from the south. \n\nWe have documents on individual combat and training. There are also second hand accounts of battles with various anecdotes about martial prowess or tactics. \n\nBut really, as far as the nitty gritty... We're in the dark. Hell there isn't even a consensus on just how cavalry was really used for 2000 years of its existence. It's mostly speculation. \n\nFrankly for the period of history stretching long before pike and shot, we don't even know for sure how *most* people held their spears. Pike and shot era is beyond my area of interest but I'd assume there are plenty of controversial topics about its specific techniques. IIRC our understanding of how 2handed swords were used en masse comes from a small handful of references. As you mentioned yourself, we don't really know what \"push of pike\" was-despite it, apparently being the major military system for a century or so.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, if we're going to look to secondary sources or retelling of battles we can look to antiquity and we see many accounts of heroic deeds and one-on-one fighting. Some people, like the Gauls relied on sending champions to fight other champions. Some would call each other out during battles and face off. This is seen in many other places including Caesar's campaigns and the Ulster cycle. Similarly, Herodotus tells of a city whose fate was determined by the battle between a number of elite champions; it apparently lasted all night long until only 5 men in total were left.\n\nExamining archaeological finds from battles shows what one would expect. Chaos. Carnage. Bodies with dozens of wounds from all angles and all sorts of weaponry. \n\nNot everyone through the middle ages were highly trained, drilled and experienced warriors. A roman legionnaire stepping away from the protection of his group would be unlikely, but even trained, experienced *Nobility* charged impetuously when they got the scent of blood/glory or simply got spooked. \n\nWhat's that anecdote about \"even the most well laid plan never survives first contact with the enemy?\".\n\nTraining, flexibility and drilling makes often the difference between win and lose today and that was still true in the pre-gunpowder era.  The ability for professional or mercenary armies to fight cohesively and work together as a unity was what made them so effective. \n\nFor those *other* guys I have no doubt in my mind they got separated, split up, ahead of themselves, left behind or just scattered after periods of melee.  It just makes *sense*.  Professional athletes paid millions of dollars to do a job end up way out of position, overwhelmed, confused and looking very different to what their posture looked like at the beginning. How the hell did you end up so deep??? The play is over here!

The last of those journeys was in 1430, but there was still a lot of Chinese trade in the Indian Ocean after that point.\n\nThere were also military forays into Mongolian areas, an occupation of Vietnam, attempts to control Tibet, etc. In the 1590s, the Ming repelled a Japanese invasion of Korea. \n\nChinese sent envoys to the Philippines to trade with the Spanish in the late 16th Century. They also welcomed European trade and allowed various Westerners to send envoys to the capital. \n\nThere were issues in their neighborhood to deal with. The Mongols were always dangerous. The Tibetans were supposed to be a part of China (since the Yuan), but acted more as a disloyal vassal. Vietnam became independent. Japan invaded Korea. Japanese pirates were all over the place.

Europe is extremely small, was partitioned into dozens of Kingdoms.\n\nThere was nowhere left to expand unless you went to war, and your neighbours were basically technologically equals (somewhat). Its much easier to sail over to a land occupied by technologically inferior races and grab their land then to fight your neighbour and risk losing your own land.\n\nWhereas the Asiatics had much more space available.

This in part is probably due to the solidification of Confucianism, which emphasizes order and harmony.\n\nThere was also the matter of China having to deal with a few successful incursions by the Mongols. Due to the nature of Mongolians, they chose to somewhat integrate themselves INTO Chinese culture rather than exert control over China as a colony of Mongolia. So even though Mongols were 'sort' of in control of China, in those dynasties (Yuan and Qing), China was still 'China'.\n\nEurope was far more fractured than China, and in a state of perpetual war.
