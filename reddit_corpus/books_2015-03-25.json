They are consistently good reads: inventive, compelling, mysterious, existential.  I particularly liked A Wind-Up Bird Chronicle because there was a little more substance to it than some of his previous works.  However, I haven't read any recent Murakami because his novels tend to be almost identical in theme, characters, and plot.  \n\nTypically it starts with a lonely, sensitive guy whose life is mostly empty. He fills his pedestrian existence with books, music, liquor and food-- UNTIL!-- a beautiful, yet enigmatic woman enters his life.  That's when a bunch of crazy shit starts happening.  Cat Soul Flutes, World-Dominating Sheep, Mysterious Wells, Shadow Universes, and so on.  \n\nA bunch more mysterious stuff happens, not the least of which is the lonely boy somehow having sex with the beautiful woman.  In the end, the boy tries to save the girl from some esoteric/metaphorical fate.  He doesn't quite succeed in saving her, and he almost ends up destroying himself (literally and/or figuratively), but he's learned some post-modern lesson about the nature of truth.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh4i", "qSentId": 10352, "question": "Discussion of the works of Haruki Murakami: March 25, 2015", "aSentId": 10367, "answer": "Meta request: is there a write-up that could be done to give us a crash course on some of these authors?

They had to make their own.  If they wanted to disinfect something, they had to distill their own alcohol.  Usually from supplies stolen from their own captors.

We have a lot to protect, and we have actual enemies. Europe and many other places depend on our military to support them and act as a deterrence to enemy aggression. If we had no military then dollars to donuts we would have been invaded by now, since we are sitting in a strategic gold mine of resources. \n\nEDIT: So when people thank me for my service, I know some of them have no idea why they are thanking me, and couldn't find Iraq on a map to save their life....but I also know that being a service member *is* very important to defend this nation. It is serving them personally because our military keeps all 300 million Americans safe every day, and every night, whether or not it is appreciated. It must be done, and it's *not* just a job...it's much much more than that. Working at Costco is a job....working a nine to five at the office is a job.
