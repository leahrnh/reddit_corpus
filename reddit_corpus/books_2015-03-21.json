I think the exercise of trying to uncover past homosexual relationships shrouded in discreet ambiguity has been misunderstood to mean that all close male relationships are basically homosexual, or even that all feelings between men are homoerotic.  This seems to be true regardless of one's attitude towards homosexuality:  it has become just as clich\u00e9 among self-identified progressives as among proud homophobes to say \"What, are you gay for him?  Sounds like you're gay for him,\" any time a man expresses any feeling towards another man.  The progressives, of course, see themselves as bravely transgressing against hetero-normativity, while the homophobes see themselves as properly policing against inappropriate intimacy between men.  Their common ground is the assumption that emotion between men is inherently sexual.  I've read a gay man saying there is only one kind of affection between men and the only difference is whether you're brave enough to fuck each other.  I think that's a minority opinion even among men who are attracted to men, but is it really that far from how we're taught to read male relationships in literature?  In our day-to-day lives we flippantly embrace this idea by saying we have a \"man-crush\" or \"lady-crush\" any time we have strong positive feelings towards somebody of the same sex, and men learn to be cautious about expressing admiration for female coworkers lest we be perceived as creepy or partial.  \n\nNobody wants to be the  person who doesn't see the sex right under their nose, so we defensively make a policy of seeing sex everywhere.  Somehow this neurotic defensive tic became part of how we read literature.  If nobody is going to read an emotional relationship between men as friendship, why would anyone bother writing one that way?  As a result, fictional friendships have to be sterile.

After the fact of reading the story, you can point out all kinds of similarities in the structure, just like you can point out similarities between two people's bad days because they both felt \"a sense of loss\" and good days because they both \"gained a better understanding of the world around them\", but these are irrelevant groupings because the specific loss and the specific understanding have incredibly complex contexts.  \n  \nI don't mean that because interpretation can vary, quantitative methods can't be used. I mean that each story is an experience, and parsing that experience into archetypes of structure not only requires confirmation bias but it also requires cherry picking, which is counter intuitive to an experience. You can simplify any two stories in such a way that they start to remind you of the other, but this requires you to come at it from the perspective that there is a similarity to be found.  \n  \nThe only way to enjoy a story the way the story was invented to be enjoyed is if you put your hand in the authors and let him lead you to the destination he intends.

Holmes tells him that he must take down the case in a cool and methodological manner, because the objective nature of crime solving requires this kind of \"respect\".

In literature you don't approach the story in a cool and methodological way. That may come afterwards and it's only tangentially related to the story.  \n  \nYou have to treat Jay Gatsby as a real person before you treat him like an archetype, and what the author puts down on paper is meant to help you do that.

Anyone can tell you that if you pay close attention to the meta structure of a story you can somehow come to the logical leap that no story is original or that authors write stories that come from shared archetypes that our brains are responsible for.  \n  \nWell I contest that this is a false view. No one who vastly enjoys a story is admiring the precise meta structure that the author is employing. A good story is good because it resonates on a totally subjective level, and applying an objective analysis to the \"structure\" should only be amusing trivia.

But the way it should be seen by a person actually reading the literature is that the archetypes are something you find when you're looking for them. When you're having a great conversation with someone face to face, you don't first think about what kind of meta-structure the conversation is following. And focusing on that will distract you from the conversation.  \n  \nAnd the reason I think those archetypes are less important than researchers seem to make them is that they just don't tell us what the author is saying. It's like, searching for those archetypes is what makes those archetypes (of emotional structure) apparent. If we both started off with a bad day today, and then ended the night feeling pretty okay, we didn't have the same day. Knowing that a common structure of someone's day is that it starts off with some opposition and ends with some resolution isn't as important as some people make it out to be.  \n  \nI guess my problem is that people use the wrong words to describe what's going on. You'll see a discussion online somewhere and someone will say \"Well, yeah, authors have been telling this story since the beginning of time. It's nothing new.\" As if the fact that  Platostocrotesius wrote about a fish merchant who had his day's catch stolen and by the end of the story the fish merchant was executed means that he was the real pioneer of stories about justice (sorry for choppy sentence that you have to hack through I'm too lazy to edit).  \n  \nIt's also why I get annoyed when discussions devolve (as I see it) into discussions about tropes. Too much emphasis is placed on the meta, as though every author who puts pen to paper can only use predefined tools to tell his story.  \n  \nThe story is written, and then you can identify the meta structure because it's there for you to find. But the author didn't sift through a bucket of tools and hack it all together. There are only so many emotions that humans can feel before you start to get to ones that are really just \"synonyms\" for others (sad, disappointed). I think that a focus on the shape those emotions take just isn't central to the literature itself.  \n  \n&gt;Once that stereotype is established, any traits that differentiate that person are simply variations of the stereotype  \n  \nPaying attention to this in real life is harmful, I think. So paying attention to it in a story is also harmful. It comes *after* things are said and done, with retroactive reflection. If you sum up a character all of his actions starting then are now either agreeing or disagreeing with that sum.

Both of these are out of vogue because the former's reading of a text's meaning is too strict to account for all of the text's complexities and the latter's is too loosey-goosey  for any meaning a scholar finds to hold water within an academic context (since meaning becomes almost entirely subjective).  Elements of each are still present in modern day literary scholarship, but only to a limited extent.
