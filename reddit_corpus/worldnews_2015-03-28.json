When speaking about Palestinian right of return in the context of negotiations, it almost always refers to Palestinians who voluntarily left, or fled, or were expelled from what is now Israeli territory during the 1948 war. \n\nE.g. if a Palestinian man owned an olive grove near Haifa in 1947 and then left for the West Bank during the war because of anticipation of reprisal attack by Israelis, then right of return dictates that he or his inheritors are entitled to that land, to residence in Israel, and to citizenship (to the extent that the terms of any agreement would dictate).\n\nPalestinians want this as a matter of symbolic justice, but this is a pragmatic and existential sticking point for the Israelis. By pragmatic, I mean that Israel would have a very hard time administering this. How would they validate claims on land made by people's grandchildren? Do they have deeds? Photographs? Compelling stories? Who could arbitrate the merit of claims in a fair way, systematic, and efficient way? How would they adjudicate when comparing claimants who were forced off of their land unjustly by Israeli militias or posses, versus those who left willingly because Arab radio stations broadcasted incitements to get out of the way in advance of their armies to make their victory go faster? What about compensation to whoever currently owns the land, after it has been bought and sold any number of times in the ensuing 70 years? Dealing with the practicalities of property rights is no small undertaking when it's suggested that there were over 700,000 such possible claimants, which could be a much larger number of decedents now.\n\nAnd that brings up the existential issue. Israel is a country of 8.2 million, 1.7 million of whom are Arab. The challenges of absorbing another 700,000 or more people (should the majority of them want to exercise these rights, that is) are substantial. Imagine today that 1 million ethnically and culturally distinct people moved into the already densely populated state of New Jersey (similar in size and population to Israel). Communities would change, society would be strained, etc. And because Israel is a democracy, the political implications would be enormous as well. At a conservative estimate, a third of the Jewish state would no longer be Jewish. Possibly more. Within a generation, Jews would be in the minority, and it would cease to be a Jewish state at all. As you can imagine, this is not something that the political leadership of Israel (or the majority of its Jewish residents, or Jewish supporters abroad, for that matter) find palatable. Israel's founding documents, its declaration of independence and constitution, define it as a Jewish nation, and agreeing to an unfettered right of return would nullify that.\n\nBecause of these concerns, right of return was not included in the Oslo Accords. I.e. the Palestinians conceded it in negotiations. Though after it became obvious that the agreements would not hold, they began asserting that the right of return exists under international law independent of the accords. Israel, predictably, disagrees, and will likely never agree to it.\n\nOne thing that I also feel is important to point out is that alongside the Palestinians who were displaced in the 1948 war from Israeli lands, there were an equal if not greater number of Jews who were displaced from Arab lands that fled into Israel. Few of them, however, are particularly interested in asserting their own right of return, probably because they would prefer living in Israel over a PLO or Hamas regime. A lot of Palestinians who would want to return likely feel the same way. Social concerns about civil rights aside, Israel is a first-world country with strong opportunities and far better human and political rights in comparison to its neighbors.

There needs to be some sort of accountability/trackability in order for their to be any trust, which does not work with a purely anonymous system like bitcoin.\n\nUnfortunately those middlemen have often ended up more incompetent or malicious than their more traditional counterparts.  Were Mark Karpeles' various ventures actually any more legitimate than paypal in retrospect?  Or any of the other many exchanges that have been plagued with scandal and accusation of fraud or incompetence? \n\nThere's also the issue of the price fluctuation.  Do you really want your paypal like payment system to also be an incredibly volatile and unregulated speculative commodity market?  Holding onto a decent amount of bitcoins is a risky investment proposition, which really isn't what the average consumer wants in an online wallet.  If someone put a few hundred into a bitcoin wallet in 2013-early 2014 they'd have a small fraction of the value left, and it's still falling.\n\nFor actual examples: Mt Gox, Moolah, Neo &amp; Bee, etc etc.  It's hard to find direct examples of consumer issues because there are very few legal consumer markets that rely on bitcoin to begin with.

That's how the law works. The warrants were to recover material on Dotcom's personal servers pertaining to the case. They didn't get it, btw. Dotcom refuses to turn over the password under any sensible conditions.\n\nThe other servers contained other data which pertains to megaupload customers and other employees. It's not \"the\" data, it's some data. More data was sought and thus the NZ authorities obtained a warrant and conducted a raid.\n\n&gt; There was no reason to raid his home other than to seize assets\n\nThey sought information which would have tied Dotcom personally to infringement.

To make it sound like Siemens is refusing to sell trains to China is pretty misleading.  And all these companies were aware that they were signing technology transfer deals so I don't get why you are insisting that they stole it.  China and these train companies agreed on joint production of some trains and to allow transfer of critical technology so that China could also develop their own trains, and since all these companies know that China wanted the tech transfers to develop their own train industry I don't get how you're characterizing it as China somehow misleading people.  They paid for the tech because they're the only place in the world rapidly building tons of train lines to transport over a billion people...and companies that normally would have very little business selling trains elsewhere (since infrastructure is already developed or not wanted like in the US) were very happy to get large orders and that someone wanted to pay for their otherwise not very profitable technology.  So they agreed to the deals.  To expect China to forever have to buy only ultra expensive foreign made trains when they're basically the majority of the train market to begin with is idiotic.  Why should China be forced to only ever buy German and Japanese trains?!  Japanese car companies began after Japan initially bought all German and American cars but then Japan developed their own cars largely by copying American designs but it would have been unreasonable to expect Japan to have forever only imported American cars.\n\nYour argument is basically that China shouldn't ever be allowed to develop their own tech or do tech licensing or transfer deals to build their own industries because you want them to only import foreign tech forever and stay a low tech country???

Although NASA is very open it doesn't mean it is wide open. Data, and the science resulting from that data, is considered confidential until approved for public release.\n\nAlso as a side note, my personal experience has been that collaboration is often overrated by the public, who only look at the financial aspect of the equation. In a practical day-to-day sense, sometimes problems come up where the product being offered by the other agency just doesn't cut it. Then you spend a lot of money flying people around to hold reviews and get things up to snuff, when we could have hired an american company do it much cheaper. Of course since this help is usually free as part of agreement it usually turns out a financial gain to partner, but my point is there are losses in efficiency that have to be accounted for which depend on the capability and cooperability of the other space agency.\n\nMost of my experience comes from working on Cassini. My example for partnerships gone wrong though would be Galileo, where the (surprise!) German thrusters were complete garbage and nearly ruined the mission.", "aSentId": 42269, "answer": "&gt;don't have anything to point you to but I work for NASA and I can tell you this is certainly true\n\nYou and 18,000 other people.

Do you understand that crazy, violent right-wing ultra-nationalists with guns are running rampages through Ukrainian cities? Do you understand that Crimea has a majority Russian population and ran a public referendum(which is how major public decisions take place, and how they have been decided for hundreds of years) to rejoin Russia? Do you understand that all the international observers there called that referendum legitimate?\n\nDo you understand that Russia is there fighting a bunch of crazy people who are turning their country into an even bigger crazy-person-zone than it was before and protecting their interests in a neighboring country and Russian territory/protecting Russian people the same way the US would fight if China tried to foster a coup d'etat in Japan and take US naval/shipping rights from the major ports there?\n\nDo you understand that Ukraine was part of Russia? Do you understand that Crimea itself has been Russian for *centuries*? Do you understand that the port of Sevastopol in Crimea has been Russia's major, singular warm-water shipping / naval port that is available to Russia year-round, and it has been a Russian possession for literally hundreds of years?\n\nDo you understand that Crimea was only gifted to Ukraine because the Russian president at the time was a Ukrainian, and Ukraine was part of Russia so he just figured \"fuck it might as well let my bros administer it\"?\n\nI'm not Russian, but it appears pretty clear to me that Russia is not the bad guy in this scenario. Western superpower wanted to use Ukraine to fuck with Russia, wanting to bring Ukraine into NATO(which is **exactly like** Russia doing what she was thinking of doing in Cuba during the missile crisis), set up a missile blockade there, and invite her to the EU, etc. Russia is saying no, because that's basically a part of Russia - Crimea certainly is, historically and by modern popular referendum/vote.

It isn't perfect, nothing is. For every failure you hear about, there are 10 success that you *don't* hear about. The reason why you hear about CIA fuck ups and not the fuck ups of other intelligence agencies, like the FSB, is because the US, believe it or not, has a level of transparency when it comes to it's government.\n\nThe US government releases information to the public, that nations like Russia and China *would* never even consider releasing. Why? Because, believe it or not, the people do have a degree of power and voice in the US. Voting out Congress, voting in new Presidents etc... \n\nMake no mistake though, the CIA has been quite effective in doing it's job. They spy on foreign countries, and their special black operations are quite advanced. They have been very effective in protecting and expanding American interests, which is the whole point of what an intelligence agency is supposed to do. If you think about all the governments the CIA has overthrown, have you ever thought about the big picture? Have you ever realized that the CIA has overthrown a sovereign government in a country, halfway across the world, *without* drawing the US into any direct conflict or war? Think about that for a second.\n\nThink about the implications of it, and just how efficient you must be in order to achieve this. In the past, it took large armies, and long drawn out wars in order to overthrown another country's government. Today, the CIA doesn't have to draw it's own country into any war, and it can keep the conflict far away from the American public. As a result, it will not be a significant impact on the lives of the citizens, and it will not cause unrest, like direct conflicts would cause. It allows the US government to act in it's interests, without being held down by the people.

There are those of use who believe, however, that public sector intervention is not only a social democratic right, but also a vital form of economic competition.

To get professional help for something like depression can get you the boot from the cockpit faster than anything short of being arrested.\n\nAs a result, a lot of pilots hold on to their issues and talk to NOBODY about them.\n\nNot every person with stress in his life is a suicide waiting to happen. A ton of you will disagree, but I think it's OK to be depressed and to go to work to fly. To a lot of people, flying is the uplifting escape from problems for a while.

Too freakin' bad, it happens anyway. It's not rare either, pilots are people and that means they might be fatigued, stressed, hungry, distracted, or at odds with each other. Your planes are not always 100% functional either. Neither are your controllers, maintenance, line service, nor the CSAs.\n\nThe best way to deal with problems is not to ban faults outright but to provide methods of working with them.

So terrible.\n\nEven as a person suffering from depression (but fortunately not such a severe case) it's still not in any way possible to understand what would drive another person to not only take their own life but to take almost 150 people with them. There's never even been a thought of harming myself even through heavy breakdowns in frustration over my own behaviour, over outlooks for the future and so on, but I can totally relate to the hiding of one's own situation, the apparent own failure in life, which may not even be seen as such by the people around you.\n\nWhat I cannot in the slightest, is imagine to even think about a plan, that would hurt not only oneself and the people that are literally sitting in the same boat while executing such premeditated self destruction, but the horrible, horrible effects on the lives of relatives, colleagues, friends etc. of all those people as well as those involved in the rescue efforts.\n\nThe psychological situation is incredibly hard to overcome and you're able to hide a lot of things that go wrong from many, many, even very close people especially if you come off as \"shy, introvert\" or \"quiet\" anyways. That's why no third person should really be blamed for these events but the co-pilot. It is extremely hard to spot the illness and especially the current status of it because the affected develop very effective strategies to hide it.

To prevent a member of crew going rogue and crashing a plane, all members of the flight crew must wear a lockable, electronic stun device around their wrist.

The device will be locked around the wrist at the airport and unlocked at the destination airport by ground staff and will be made from enforced materials so that it cannot be cut or removed. Each device will have a UUID that get's linked to the name of the person wearing it. Then from a terminal in the plane, with a secure password, flight crew can access a UI from which any of the devices can be wirelessly activated to deliver it's electricity to the wearer, completely incapacitating the person. This way even if a flight crew member, pilot or co-pilot locks themselves in the cockpit or performs any other rogue behavior, the rest of the staff can take action and incapacitate the person and gain entry to the cockpit through the normal procedures.
