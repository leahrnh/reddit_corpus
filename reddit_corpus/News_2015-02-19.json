Maybe its sinking in.", "aSentId": 2274, "answer": "My grocery store runs like this as well. Have you ever seen only one person work at a Starbucks? No- there's a reason for that. It's been a major trend among retailers since the mid-2000's to run lean to increase profits and it only got worse after the Recession. I think it's primarily the obsession with increasing quarterly profits over long term growth. So they cut staff, cut hours, and see more money, their customers get more irritated every time they come to that store and deal with long waits, missing items, no service etc. This creates a carrying capacity for the store and automatically sets a ceiling for sales.\n\n So now that profits are flat, hours are cut more, some positions are eliminated, etc and the cycle gets worse but overall performance looks good. Then crisis hits, a few people are hired and existing employees work over time and sales go back up. Some stores are now either in the understaffed/ over worked category in which paying OT to a smaller number of people is cheaper than hiring more or there are a ton of part timers who work 15-20 hours a week but must keep open schedules for scheduling purposes. These low hours part time employees cycle out quickly because they can't afford to work there so the next set of new hires aren't invested in because they're expected to rotate out fast too.\n\n ", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l", "qSentId": 2269, "question": "Nobody has answered this correctly yet.

Walmart is already a price and efficiency leader.  Their problem is the shitty workforce that isn't keeping shelves stocked, the stores clean and orderly, the meat and produce fresh, helping customers, ect.  This is why many people don't shop at Walmart.  They want to become a leader in customer service and it starts by attracting a more capable workforce and being able to retain the ones you like.  They can do that by paying better than other retail outlets.\n\nThe weak job market is making this possible.

On the one hand, apologists want us to sit on our asses and do nothing. Which is *beyond* stupid. But that does **not** justify the murder that I see so many cop-haters (is there a more common word for this?) advocate.\n\nI don't care what anyone's view on the way cops act is. It doesn't matter. Killing cops is **not** the solution. Killing **anybody** is not the solution. And of course, neither is sitting on our asses.\n\n&gt; Cops feel like they can act with impunity. They assume they're accountable to no one.\n\nThis part of your post is part of the problem. You are making a vast, sweeping generalization about all cops, saying that they all act with impunity, they all assume they are not accountable. And yes, there are lots of bad cops, and **no** I'm not going to brush it aside and say \"Well, there are more *good* then *bad*, so who *cares*?\"\n\nRather, I'm going to point out that you are looking at this the **wrong way.** Individual cops are *not* the issue. Its the **system** that's fucked, the system is what we need to change. Sure, there are bad cops, but trying to pick them out one by one is curing the *symptom*, not the disease.\n\nThis is the issue. Apologists brush it all under the rug, ignoring it all, while those in the anti-cop boat want to put all cops in one light and pretend like they're \"doing something about it\".\n\nNewsflash - killing individual cops will not solve any problems. What we need to fix is the system itself. We need to get to the root of the problem. We need to make it so that police *are* held accountable, so that they *can't* act with impunity - killing a cop doesn't solve that issue at all.\n\nNow it sounds like you're saying that the goal here would be to get a message across, as if that is the only way we can act on this issue, and I have to say that I vehemently disagree. Violence is not the only way to \"get the message across\". Solving problems nonviolently is the answer - be the bigger person.\n\nI realize that it might be hard to fix the system nonviolently - after all, a lot of people feel like the system is ignoring them, that their pleas for police to be held accountable are going unnoticed. Perhaps this is correct, but that doesn't mean we should start murdering people. Cops are not the root of the issue, and in fact most of them are ordinary men and women with families and kids. Do you really think killing those people will solve the problem?\n\nI don't have the answer of how to fix it, I just know its not violence.\n\n**tl;dr** Fuck the apologists. Fuck the cop-haters.

I went through this already - cure the disease, not the symptoms. The problem is - and this is directed at the people advocating *violence*, nobody else - murdering cops is curing the symptom and not the disease, and that's ignoring the morality of the act. I'm not trying to say I'm better than anybody - anyone can tell you that curing symptoms is never the answer.\n\n&gt; Cop-hater who doesn't advocate killing anyone checking in here.\n\nSee, here's a mentality I don't understand. You identify yourself as a cop-hater. This means that you are, in fact, making a sweeping generalization about a group of people. Cops are people - and yet, you are explicitly saying here that you hate cops. You hate a group of people based on their occupation alone. This promotes the idea of curing symptoms and not the disease - if someone is so focused on hating cops rather than the actual underlying issue, nothing is going to get done.\n\nIf you said you hated retail workers, or plumbers, or mailmen you'd probably get downvoted to hell, but on Reddit if you say you hate cops, you're going to get a shitton of karma.

Because his defense is going to be, \"I felt threatened for my life at the time and felt it was necessary to use lethal force.\" He's then going to argue that he HAD to use lethal action. That lethal action was necessary in this case - to prevent even more lawsuits. He's going to argue that he acted heroically for killing someone that was going to shoot at fellow cops. That he has no remorse for defending the people innocent people around him.\n\nIt's a reasonable defense to start laying down. Hence the reason he also says, \"I don't know why I said 'I'm sorry'\" or \"I don't know remember mentioning my wrist hurting.\" \n\nIt's laying a defense. Any reasonable person, facing what he's facing would do this. So I'm just discounting that it's \"Unbelievable\" that \"the shooter shows no remorse\".

Stop talking about properly trained LEOs as if it's not well documented that even the most well trained officers/military make major fuckups during these type of encounters where all basic gu n knowledge like taking off safety/reloading mags goes out the window. In all honesty that's what it looks like from the evidence--a major fuckup.

Fairfax/Prince William County.  I saw a number of things happen during the time I lived there.  I will keep this short and narrow it down to two incidents.\n\nMy sister was involved in a minor two car fender bender, in our subdivision, two blocks from our house.  The police were called.  The other car was uninsured.  The LEO was flirting with my sister throughout the entire process.  My sister did not reciprocate.  (she was, at the time, in the process of moving in with her boyfriend/fiance)  The LEO was persistent and my sister rebuffed him a number of times.  He tells the uninsured motorist that he is free to go, without taking any of his information.  He then pointed out to my sister that he had access to her information, in any case; that she had clothes, make up, etc in her vehicle; and if he wanted to, could easily come up with a prostitution charge...  \n\nShe got his information.  She lodged a complaint.  It was implied that it was not only my sister's fault (that it was instigated by her to curry favor at the accident scene), but also a MISUNDERSTANDING on my sister's part.\n\nNothing happened to the officer, and apparently, there was no record of the accident.  At ALL.\n\nThe second one I am going to tell you about?  I blame them for my sister's death.  Please bear with me, this is hard to type.  It's been many years, but the wound is still fresh.  Forgive me for being vague.  I am afraid of specifics that will identify my family.  I will try to answer questions, should there be any forthcoming.\n\nMy sister and her fiance were fighting via cell phone.  It got pretty bad and he called the police (he was at work) and told them she had threatened self harm in a public location. (empty, fairly secluded pull over off the highway)  The police showed up, surrounded my sister's vehicle and showed up at her fiance's work.  The phone call was terminated and he was denied access to both his cell phone and his work phone.  This occurs at approximately 6:00pm.\n\nThey go to my parent's house, inquiring about a SON, by my sister's name.  (Her name could be male or female)  My parents tell them they have a child by that name, but no sons.  The LEO asks *\"Are you sure.\"*  My parents confirm once again, and with no further explanation, the LEO leaves.  It is at this point I get a phone call from my parents asking me if I know what is going on.  Other than a panic call I had received from my sister earlier - she wanted to confirm that her fiance was cheating and asked me if I knew how to access his email - no, I had no clue.  We all go into panic mode.  We call her fiance (cell and work).  We are denied access to him.\n\nThey have a lot of cars and officers on scene now.  She is refusing to exit the vehicle.  Her car idles until it runs out of gas.  It's very cold.  We plead with the police; all we want is to know exactly where she is and to talk to her.  \n\n*\"Absolutely not.  We know what we're doing.\"*\n\n14 - *FOURTEEN* - hours later - in which she hasn't eaten, gone to the restroom, and has been denied repeated requests to speak to her fiance/family, someone decides that tear gas is a good idea.\n\nA shot is fired.  My sister is killed instantly.\n\nThey now decide to go back to my parent's house and tell them their child is dead.  Here's my card, we may contact you for questions later.\n\nOver the course of the next few weeks, I am contacted by 3 (THREE) LEOs that were **on scene**.  They tell me that this situation was FUBARed, and badly.  I reached someone at the station that told me I needed to get a copy of the report, NOW.  That he would fax it to me.  NOW.  Before it was too late.  By the time I got to my office and got the fax machine up and running, it was too late. (about 30 - 45 mins had passed)  He no longer had access to said paperwork.  Two of the LEOs were actually friends of my sisters and one of them pulled me aside at her wake to tell me that \"This is not right.  This is not right AT ALL.\"  He said he would see what, if anything he could do.  The other one became evasive and distant.  SHE got a promotion and we never heard from her again.  She was on of my sister's *close* friends.\n\nWe buried my sister.  It was very surreal.  My parents aged twenty years that day.  Everyone that knew her was in shock.  \n\n**How could this have happened?** \n\nAt the end of the day, we were stonewalled.  Either no one knew anything, or they could not speak with us on the matter.  After much insistence, I received a copy of the incident report.  It looked like a public release UFO reporting document.  It was fucking incomprehensible.  It was more blacked out lines than visible text, by a long shot.  I was told, after some time had passed, that this was mishandled, and this case was now a part of the \"what NOT to do in a situation\" training.  That we were never going to see any resolution, of any kind, **EVER**.  That this had been swept under the rug and would never see the light of day. \n\nI apologize for the wall of text.  I'm not sure I know how to tl;dr this at all.  I have not looked at this so closely for a long while.  It's been over ten years.  And now, here I sit, weeping like a baby again.  \n\nI apologize.  I guess my point is that this happens, it hurts people, and I'm not sure what to do except encourage the exposure of these incidents and rally support for others that have fallen victim to such horrible, horrible pain.\n\nTo those that made it this far, thank you for reading.\n\n", "aSentId": 7221, "answer": "You have an important stake in the Fairfax story too.

Thus, it's fascinating that this manifests itself today that homosexuals are, on average, superior parents compared to heterosexual parents. This is borderline outside of my field of Evolutionary Biology and into Psycology, but homosexuals tend to have children when they are older, more mature, more wealthy, have better jobs, are more educated, etc. And thus, their children are more likely to make better risk-taking decisions, be more wealthy, have a better education, have a better job, less likely to get STDs/STIs, etc. \n\nThe only downfall to homosexual parenting is the negative connotations of society can impact mental health.

But, if you just modify the major histogram complex enough, and play with some genetic switches we don't fully understand yet, you could make it so that the Kin Selector wants children, but doesn't want to do the actions required for it.
