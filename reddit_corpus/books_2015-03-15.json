That's a very human concept and idea), but right off the bat it looks to me like the author is just trying to sound deep and meaningful.  Ergo, I avoid the book on expectation of purple prose and other such shallow showing-off.\n\nWhich is interesting, because one of my all-time favourite books is called *What The Body Remembers*, which also looks like Pretty Words at first glance.

The words she used did not come across as flashy, and so she never seemed as pretentious to me.\n\nSo to sum up, I suppose a good title is one that shows an author has been thinking about their book and that brings an implication of *story*.  They are not trying to sound smart, they are trying to convey an idea in as few words as they can get away with.

Whether they can actually afford it or not is irrelevant. Being poor is just *one* reason they wouldn't have bought it; there are many other reasons.\n\nIt's a *two worlds* problem. In World A, no pirating is possible and everybody who is willing to buy the book for the asking prices buys the book. In World B, pirating happens and some of the people who would have bought in World A now download it. This is the gross cost of pirating to the author. But also, many people in World B will read the book, leading them to many outcomes that may benefit the author, e.g., buying future books (which they wouldn't have in World A), increasing the number of supporters in various ways (social media, word-of-mouth, book signing, etc.) that result in promotional value leading *other* benefits for the author, e.g., other people buying who wouldn't have in World A, paid speeches, better publication contracts, or even just more people believing what the author wants them to believe.\n\nUltimately what matters for an author is whether the benefits from World B relative to World A exceed the costs of World B relative to World A. It's a hard thing to compute, for sure, but it is very clear that World B *can* be much, much better for an author.\n\nAnother way to think about it is the billions of dollars of valuation for social media companies that may have never earned a profit, or perhaps even revenue. Their valuation is based on the number of users (eyes on) and the *potential* to monetize them. The pirate model is basically the same idea, that an artist/author can benefit from both \"paid accounts\" but also by monetizing the value of the free users as well, and that can happen in many ways.

These are bestsellers, not books by new (or struggling) authors. The proportion of money lost by publishers is not going to be as severe because the reason that the boy is selling these books is that they **are** bestsellers.

I'll try to explain. \n\nI took more than just the amount of sales/revenue into consideration. You may know that women's rights are a big issue in India. So reading a pirated \"I am Malala\" would lead to a greater positive effect than reading \"The Fault in Our Stars\" would provide. They're different books that spread different ideas, and one is certainly more politically relevant than the other. (I chose my example on purpose.)\n\nThe other thing that I considered was the fact that the \"bookshop culture\" isn't as popular in India as it is in other places - it's definitely growing. The people who would buy from the young boy would typically be teenagers or young students, while bookshops attract young adults and adults. There would be some overlap, but it comes down to disposable income in the end.\n\nJust one more thing: It's important to consider the books that the boy is selling. These are bestsellers, not books by new (or struggling) authors. The proportion of money lost by publishers is not going to be as severe because the reason that the boy is selling these books is that they **are** bestsellers. They have already sold well enough for the boy's *employers* to make copies of the book. It doesn't justify the practice legally, but bootlegging is a part of every developing economy. It is what it is.\n\n", "aSentId": 6928, "answer": "That's very well put and I appreciate your comment. I certainly agree that the spread of books provides value beyond just the money they make for the publishers, and I also agree with your description of the economics of the industry.\n\nHowever there are certain disadvantages of piracy that must be weighed against the positive (or at least non detrimental) aspects of the current piracy situation.\n\nThe first is that publishing and other media companies in these countries can be hindered from developing, since they're unable to monetize their products. Look at the list of largest media companies today - they're all American, Western European, or other countries with strong copyright laws. Some may disagree with me that there are socially beneficial effects to having these large media companies [and I wouldn't push back very hard against them], but everyone I think will concede that there are *some* benefits to the scale they provide, and, without copyright protection, they'll never be able to grow to that level. (There may also be some people that disagree that large conglomerate media companies exist solely because of strong copyright laws, and while that's true, I would just clarify my point by saying strong copyright is necessary, but not sufficient.)\n\nCopyright also helps smaller artists grow without needing to rely as significantly on a larger corporation. For example, if smaller musicians could actually rely on distributing their music for-profit online, they would have another business model which they could use to grow, instead of just the tour promotional strategy which they're stuck with now. I know that's simplifying the commercial process for the smaller artists, but I think you'll agree having another viable way to monetize their product can't possibly hurt the little guy. More of a first world problem, I know, but I'm a sucker for wanting to support the arts, especially the developing arts, and I really think piracy is hurting the little guy more than it helps.\n\nAnd what else? I suppose you could point to the long legacy that intellectual property has made possible in the United State, and worry that without strong IP laws, our \"yankee ingenuity\" might be a thing of the past. You could also point to the rather undemocratic way that the law is being changed - instead of agreeing as a society how we should behave, and following the law, people are simply ignoring it because there's no repercussion and no one can actually punish them. I would rather people abide by the law and change it democratically rather than to simply break it.  \n\nThanks again for your interesting comments. I really view the piracy and copyright issues putting us between a rock and a hard place, which is why I'm going on about all these downsides, as I see them. Totally agree with you that there are some possible benefits - but do they outweigh the cons? I'm not so sure.\n\n", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh4i", "qSentId": 6931, "question": "I haven't read any of his stuff, where should I start?", "aSentId": 6932, "answer": "Just don't.

I don't really consider length a factor. A young determined reader can read any length of book. Just give them a book mark and a couple of days. I guess my mental divide is on the subjects of sex, death and violence and how they treat it.  If there's only romance no sexual interaction; death is something that isn't graphic and the focus is more on moving on, and violence is not targeted or described in graphic detail I consider it more kids. So for older kids I'd say the Tamora Pierce Circle of Magic books, the Darren Shan Saga, A Series of Unfortunate Events, Percy Jackson, Harry Potter, the Young Wizards series. \n\nFor YA there may be sexual attraction or even sexual relationships but they're not graphic and violence because more descriptive and senseless but not graphic. I'd put say the Hunger Games in this series and some of the earlier Wheel of Time books. A little too much violence and the subject of forced prostitution for me to recommend it to say a 12 year old but something I'd feel comfortable with a 14 year old reading. To me a lot of fantasy books fit in this category; the Heralds of Valdemar and Pern for example.  \n\nBy contrast I actually do like the early Anita Blake series where she has an active and relatively descriptive sex life and also cuts the hearts of out vampires; the Kushiel series which includes espionage,  torture and prostitution; or say most of the stuff by Christopher Moore.

Why? Because when something hits with that crowd they go all in, they'll spend all their parents' money on it and tell all their friends. \n\nWhen I was a kid there was not much of a YA section - there were kid's books and everything else. I quickly moved into \"everything else.\" And there was almost no marketing campaign for books - that was left to the schools. Now, a lot of the SF/fantasy books I used to read are being shelved in YA, because a lot of them happen to start off with a teen protagonist. They're usually adults by the end, but I guess that doesn't matter.\n\nThere are a lot of factors going on here -\n\n1. YA books are now hot items, with huge marketing campaigns and movie tie-ins\n\n2. A lot of the most popular YA does follow certain tropes - teen saves the world, teens with romance drama angst, teens with bad parents or absent parents, etc. Of course, a lot of it isn't very good - a lot of *every* genre isn't very good.\n\n3. Once something becomes a hit - tons of copycats jump on the bandwagon and publishers churn out lots of crap (this is everything of course, not just YA).\n\n4. Lots of adults find YA engaging and fun and emotional - they aren't hiding it.\n\n5. There's a segment of people - I'm going to make a huge generalization here and say a lot of them are in their 20s to early 30s - that feel reading about teenager problems is demeaning and/or silly. After all, they are way past all that right? They are Adults now - capital A - and look back on those years as a phase they survived and now want to forget ever happened. \nAnything that smacks of first love or \"finding yourself\" or teen wish-fulfillment is just stupid or a waste of time. Maybe they are a little too close to it still, maybe it was a painful, lonely time, maybe it was a great time and they've moved on. For whatever reason, these are the ones who like to slam YA or sniff down their noses at it.\n\n6. People past that stage or who never felt that way enjoy YA for a lot of reasons that have nothing to do with the complexity of emotion or levels of sex/violence/foul language. It's often a nice antidote to all the \"grimdark\" or the casts of thousands or adults suffering midlife crises. \nAlso, many parents are reading books along with their children - it's nice that they are, and that they can enjoy those books also though from a different perspective.\n\ntl;dr - this got away from me and I kind of rambled. YA is a huge catch all, lots of adults are enjoying it, some are turning up their noses at it for whatever reason. Silly.

Round the squatting child was the protection of parents and school and policemen and the law. Roger's arm was conditioned by a civilization that knew nothing of him and was in ruins.\n\nMeanwhile, someone writing a so-called YA novel will rely much more on context, actions and speech to convey the inner workings of the characters.

Nobody is going to be talking about them in 50 or maybe even 30 years. Why should other people stick up for these books when even the fans of the books don't stick around? \n\nI also find it odd that you compare YA fiction to \"The Classics.\" You know that literary fiction is still being written, right? Why would you not compare to writers like Jonathan Franzen, Zadie Smith, or Kazuo Ishiguro? Why do write about the style of classic literary fiction instead of the emerging trends of style in contemporary literary fiction? \n\n&gt;I say that those who deem this less intelligent, conflate style with message, and forget that it is the message itself that counts the most. And yes, I think \"YA\" does a far better job at conveying said message.\n\nNo, the message is not more important. It's easy to come up with some kind of moral lesson like being yourself, or respecting people's differences. And I often hear this as an excuse for poor writing (\"But it teaches people that...\"). Needing some kind of instruction or lesson from writing or art is childish. Style is more important because that's what you spend 200+ pages looking at.

YA means that the main characters are probably under 25 years old.\n3. If a book is marketed as YA then the publishers think it will have mass market appeal, as opposed to novels that might fit generalizations #1 and #2 but get shelved with other genres like Fantasy or Sci Fi.\n\nYou ask whether \"it truly warrant the connotation of being written for adolescents?\" I wonder how things change if you reframe \"YA\" from being FOR young adults to being ABOUT young adults?\n", "aSentId": 7363, "answer": "&gt;YA means that it has been deemed appropriate for most teens - so there will be little to moderate swearing, sex, and graphic violence.\n\nTrue.
