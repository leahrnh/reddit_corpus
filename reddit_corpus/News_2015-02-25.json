If the landowner continues to refuse they generally will see if a different landowner will cooperate and allow them to go around.\n\nBut in many of these areas that they would have to go through the landowner owns a huge 10 mile swath of land that would cost huge sums of money (additional labor and materials) to go around. \n\nSo the government has decided and upheld in the past that these utilities that they grant eminent domain rights to (note this isnt every O&amp;G company there are strict rules about which companies get this) that their infrastructure that they build is for the good of the nation as a whole and outweighs the needs of 1 person. Just like how the government can eminent domain your house to build a highway. \n\nNow remember the company is going to have to spend the time and manhours filing this with the government, getting lawyers to fight the inevitable lawsuit, and devote time to trying to offset the landowners rage. This is causing them extra money to have to eminent domain this guys property but it is still less than diverting 10-20 miles out of the way for pipe (which can be stupidly expensive) without even considering the extra cost of buying land and if the other landowners will work with them also. \n\nThen at the end of the day when the filings go through and the government forces the individual to give us, the landowner gets paid a  rate that is set by the relevant government agencies which is almost always cheaper than what the company was willing to pay in the first place.

However, here in Canada, we have quite a few pipelines running through national parks, or very close. The line from alberta to BC is huge and has many smaller ones that branch off to the states. \n\nThere are many others that go to and from the same areas, but they're old. The XL replaces them and actually decreases the potential for a leak. Secondly, how else is oil going to get down there? Shipping it. Trains, trucks, etc. What's the chance of one of those causing a spill/leak? Higher than a pipeline. See, the newer pipelines (XL) have MANY monitoring stations throughout it. On the small chance that a leak is to occur, they shut it down immediately and have a quick response to clean up. Oil companies hate bad reputation from leaks. Just look at BP. People still haven't forgotten about it and neither have they. \n\nAnyways, I'm biased because I'm in the industry, but technically, so is everyone. Oil has become a necessity for all no matter what way you look at it. Sure there may be better resources out there, but nothing as easy and readily available as oil at the moment. \n\nAlso, just to add on to my last point, the industry isn't slowing down because of other energy resources.

It's obviously much more complex than how I'm explaining it, but there's also, certainly, no sure way of knowing this and if they don't, then I sound crazy, and also slightly smart. And if we do get a GOP President in 2016, that just basically means repealing anything Obama did good while in office. This isn't an Anti-GOP rant, either if it comes off that way to anybody.

They remain state apparatuses, heavily confined to the state's desires, existing solely to execute the will of the state.\n\nMail in the U.S. would do wonderful if privatized.

The rare material letters one finds necessary in our modern life could very readily and easily be delivered by any existing delivery service or by potential ones in the future. Naturally some private entities use the post office's services at profit to themselves, but I assure you they have the critical infrastructure necessary to carry out the required services.\n\nWhere you believe an economic downturn will come from, I do not know.

If the state of texas or alaska could levy HALF of those taxes for themselves, they would be solvent. The federal government has to subsidize these states simply because they rob them of needed revenue. It's a vicious cycle.\n\nMany states feel inclined to support their citizens through government welfare programs because they do not make enough money without examining some of the reasons they do not make enough money.\n\n1) The state subsidizes businesses that do not pay their workers a market wage through the very welfare programs themselves: Without state welfare many businesses would not be viable. Without state support, many businesses such as walmart would collapse because of how intertwined they are with the state(The state referring in this sentence to government in general.)\n\n2) The state prevents smaller businesses from arising largely in part of previous point: They support these large pseudo-monopolies while enforcing regulations, fees, and licenses that small businesses cannot afford. Whereas walmart could easily afford to pay for all the required licenses, inspections, and arbitrary minimum wages, small businesses cannot. Walmart is one of the largest contributors to 'minimum wage increase' movements in the united states because they are very aware of this fact.\n\n3) The state takes a great deal of money from individuals directly from their paycheck which impacts their ability to sustain themselves. On top of this, almost all states in the union charge varying degrees of sales tax which further harm the poorer individuals in that state. But then they take that money and use it subsidize them in the form of welfare because they can't afford to eat and house themselves because their paychecks aren't large enough because the state takes money from them and prevents them from selling their labor on a competitive market(The state, instead, creates a simple uncompetitive market where only established businesses can survive.)\n\n4) To further elaborate on the aforementioned vicious cycle: The state offers tax breaks to large businesses like wal-mart and does not offer the same to small businesses.\n\n5) The state further punishes the lower class via constantly inflating the common currency while wages remain stagnant, largely in part to their aforementioned subsidies and protectionism.\n\nThis sick mixture between big business and big government needs to come to an end.

You can create jobs by hiring some people to litter and others to clean it up.  But this is a drag on the economy because you are both taking workers out of productive activities and financing their work through taxation.  \n\nThe standard should be efficiency.  Real wages increase when the same labor produces more of what people want to buy. Similarly, real wages increase when firms figure out how to produce the same goods at lower cost.  Prices drop and workers can buy more with their paychecks.  \n\nThe oil industry wants this pipeline because it will lower transport costs and open up more oil fields for production.  This will increase the supply of oil and decrease its cost.  The decrease in the price of oil will be tiny, but will affect a huge number of people.\n\nIn the short-run, the extra investment will translate into more jobs for low-skilled workers (and fewer resources available for other investments or consumption).  In the long-run, the pipeline will provide more resources for society, which will translate into higher real wages for most everyone in society but by a small amount.  The industries building the pipeline want to do it because the cost of producing it is less than the future stream of revenues after discounting by the interest rate.  In turn, the interest rate reflects how people trade off consumption now verses consumption later, as well as alternative potential investments.  If you ever have a project where the interest rate required to make a profit is higher than the current interest rate, that means that this project will produce more value than other marginal investments being made elsewhere in the economy. It also means that people are willing to forgo consumption today for more consumption in the future if the cost of waiting is smaller than the return to the project.  So the firm is making the socially optimal decision by comparing the internal rate of return to the interest rate -- if there are not other costs to society that the firm does not consider (either out of altruism, lawsuits, regulation, or taxes/fines).  These costs to society that the firm does not take into account are called *externalities*.  In general, this is the crux of the debate when it comes to oil production: the Left generally believes the externalities from oil production and consumption are large, while the Right generally believes they are small.  Although this is the crux of the debate, it is usually not discussed in these terms.   \n\nObama opposes the pipeline because the Democrat's environmentalist constituency is very concerned about anthropogenic global warming.  They oppose any investment that would increase the supply of oil because it will increase the consumption of oil and thereby carbon dioxide emissions.  This is more of a moral stand than a practical one for them because the alternative is for Canada to construct a pipeline to one of its port cities, where most of the oil would be shipped to China.  Since the oil industry prefers to run the pipeline to Texas, it can be presumed that such a pipeline would be more valuable or less costly, so sending oil to China might be less profitable and might translate in less oil being extracted from Canada.  But I imagine that the difference in oil extraction given a pipeline for sending oil to China versus one for sending oil to Texas would be small.  \n\nIn short, the pipeline would provide a modest economic boost but is anathema to a core Democratic constituency.  Whether or not it is built will not much affect the future of the country one way or the other, but it is a symbolic issue.  It shows the priorities of each party.  It shows what can be expected from all the other legislation and regulations the two parties push.

For example, we have low rates of violent death.  In prehistoric societies, over fifty percent of men died due to violent conflict (mostly inter-tribal warfare).  In the medieval era, fewer died due to violent conflict, and fewer still in the 1800's. The 20th century was the least violent century in all of human history despite the Stalinist purges and WWI and WWII and the holocaust.  Only a few percent of people died deaths caused by the violence of others.  And the present century may be better still.  \n\nI wouldn't be so pessimistic about fusion power.  The Lockheed Skunkworks group announced they have a new approach to fusion for which they anticipate having a working prototype in five years and something ready for industry in ten.  This is the group that built the SR-71.  They are highly competent.  They have little to gain by over-promising.  And they have a lot to lose if they don't deliver. I believe we will have fusion power providing electricity on the grid in under two decades.  This will change everything.  Not only will it be great for the environment, but it will also result in lower prices for things that require energy, and for things that require things that require energy.  That's just about everything.  Think about it.  With cheep, clean electricity, it could be less expensive to grow plants indoors under LED's than in farms.  Can you imagine the vast swaths of American farmland returning to nature?  Because that future might be only a few decades away.  \n\nThe most valuable resource humans have is ideas.  Economic growth doesn't so much come from extracting more resources as it does from making better use of the resources we have have.  Think about it.  Microchips are made from silicon, which is basically nothing more than refined sand.  Sand.  The differences between what you walk on in the beach and the modern computer is an idea (really, a whole lot of ideas as well as people who have organized themselves into different firms in response to offered wages and firms who have purchased or produced different goods so as to make the most value from the resources they have available).  \n\nThis is one reason I am so skeptical of those who worry about overpopulation.  The more people there are the more inventors and scientists and specialists there are.  The more scientists, the more ideas.  The more ideas, the less resources we need to increase our standard of living.  Fusion power would not be possible if the world had only 100 million people because we could never have afforded to have so many people developing the theories and the technologies to develop it.  But with fusion power, all these people can enjoy high standards of living with less impact on the environment than that made by a much smaller population 100 years ago.  \n\nWhile fusion is still a hypothetical, the environment in America today is vastly better than it was in 1900.  There is less particulate pollution.  Forests have regrown.  Streams and lakes are cleaner.  Many forms of wildlife that were on the edge of extinction have seen their populations rebound.  \n\n\n\n", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l", "qSentId": 14153, "question": "Who says being concerned about global warming isn't practical?", "aSentId": 14160, "answer": "Indeed - environmental damage has its costs, costs that economists have until recently pretty much ignored altogether.

A skill is a skill no matter how you got it. Temporary or permanent job? Doesn't matter! I learned to weld, install pipeline, drive a truck, or manage a group of people working toward a common goal. ", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l", "qSentId": 14151, "question": "Regardless, \"jobs\" shouldn't be the standard for economic policy.  You can create jobs by hiring some people to litter and others to clean it up.  But this is a drag on the economy because you are both taking workers out of productive activities and financing their work through taxation.  \n\nThe standard should be efficiency.  Real wages increase when the same labor produces more of what people want to buy. Similarly, real wages increase when firms figure out how to produce the same goods at lower cost.  Prices drop and workers can buy more with their paychecks.  \n\nThe oil industry wants this pipeline because it will lower transport costs and open up more oil fields for production.  This will increase the supply of oil and decrease its cost.  The decrease in the price of oil will be tiny, but will affect a huge number of people.\n\nIn the short-run, the extra investment will translate into more jobs for low-skilled workers (and fewer resources available for other investments or consumption).  In the long-run, the pipeline will provide more resources for society, which will translate into higher real wages for most everyone in society but by a small amount.  The industries building the pipeline want to do it because the cost of producing it is less than the future stream of revenues after discounting by the interest rate.  In turn, the interest rate reflects how people trade off consumption now verses consumption later, as well as alternative potential investments.  If you ever have a project where the interest rate required to make a profit is higher than the current interest rate, that means that this project will produce more value than other marginal investments being made elsewhere in the economy. It also means that people are willing to forgo consumption today for more consumption in the future if the cost of waiting is smaller than the return to the project.  So the firm is making the socially optimal decision by comparing the internal rate of return to the interest rate -- if there are not other costs to society that the firm does not consider (either out of altruism, lawsuits, regulation, or taxes/fines).  These costs to society that the firm does not take into account are called *externalities*.  In general, this is the crux of the debate when it comes to oil production: the Left generally believes the externalities from oil production and consumption are large, while the Right generally believes they are small.  Although this is the crux of the debate, it is usually not discussed in these terms.   \n\nObama opposes the pipeline because the Democrat's environmentalist constituency is very concerned about anthropogenic global warming.  They oppose any investment that would increase the supply of oil because it will increase the consumption of oil and thereby carbon dioxide emissions.  This is more of a moral stand than a practical one for them because the alternative is for Canada to construct a pipeline to one of its port cities, where most of the oil would be shipped to China.  Since the oil industry prefers to run the pipeline to Texas, it can be presumed that such a pipeline would be more valuable or less costly, so sending oil to China might be less profitable and might translate in less oil being extracted from Canada.

What caused it they keystone to cut so far east before crossing the border instead of taking the newly proposed path?", "aSentId": 15016, "answer": "&gt;Why was the proposed addition/shortcut to the pipeline not part of the original plan?\n\nThe original keystone (not the XL part) was built using existing right-of-ways that has brought oil out of Canada as far south as Oklahoma and also sent it east for refining. Good so far, but XL did a few things that matter. 1) It includes the Bakken shale deposits in the Dakotas where there is little pipe infrastructure and rail cars are the method of transport. 2) It keeps costs down by laying the pipe to cut the corner between Alberta and Texas. Most of the US directly south of Alberta includes mountains and rock formations so the pipe had to run east before turning south. 3) It got the oil to the Gulf Coast, where there are state-of-the-art oil refineries that are being underutilized and would do the best job of refining. The East Coast refineries  are not large enough to handle as much oil as Canada can deliver. 4. It allowed a truly big bore, which gives economies of scale and allows for significant redundancies in safety features. The Alaska pipeline has been retrofitted with some of these more advanced systems. 5. Building in two phases allowed TransCanada to finance construction.\n\nThe value to America in jobs is slight (considering how many \"discouraged workers\" there are who really need full time employment there is nothing that will give us that level of employment), but the safety of oil through large pipe is so much higher than by rail as to be almost unassailable. Of course, there are those who say that we should not care to support Canadian oil companies, yet it is those Canadian oil companies that have been driving the Canadian economy. Like Texas, the province of Alberta has been the growth engine of Canada. In Canada though, this wealth is shared with the other provinces through transfer payments, with seven of the ten provinces receiving money from Alberta's economy. So, smacking down this pipeline hurts Canada's economy, although many in Canada are more ardent environmental activists than some Americans  - think GreenPeace, which was founded in Vancouver, BC , Canada  -  and would be happy to see XL fail.\n\nCanada's other options are to ship the oil east through an existing line which was originally meant to carry oil to Eastern Canada but was reversed due to the price of crude in New York harbor that Alberta crude could not match, or build a pipeline to the West Coast  -   likely to the deep harbor at Kitimat, British Columbia.  These options send unrefined crude by ship to either Europe or China. Can you say Exxon Valdez? \n\nI do not think the eastern pipeline will do enough as it is too small, and the shorter line west to the coast has political issues involving how Canada settled native land claims. From the Canadian energy industry's point of view XL is a better idea. The good news, if they are forced to ship through a Canadian pipeline, is that the price of oil is set using differing benchmarks: WTI (West Texas Intermediate)  and Brent. &lt;I do not think Dubai is not relevant for an American comparison.&gt; If the only option is a Canadian pipe, that does not include refining in the US (value added), then Canadian oil is priced for the first time using Brent, which is a higher price that Canada has been getting selling the oil into the US. The interesting news is that China has been buying large stakes in oilsands companies over the last decade and likely will fund the pipeline west. TransCAnada is not involved in this build.\n\nTL;DR: This infrastructure is being built on TransCanada's dime, and due to costs this was always planned as the second phase in construction.

No. Not a straight up one anyway.\n\nI believe this to be false. The idea of \"starting a war you can't win\" against a powerful nation is the idea strictly behind almost every revolution. I hate to sound like I'm the one beating a war drum, and I know violence begets violence, but there is a certain point where events turn inevitable. \n\nAnd frankly, from a large majority of people I know in the military *we wouldn't have to fight them.* Honestly, if it comes down to US people vs US Gov't, obviously the US military is the trump card. A coup d'etat would likely not benefit the people. However, I believe the notion of the National Guard, combined with over 900,000 LEO's marching down our streets and killing American citizens (which ya know....already happens) is a **programmed one.**\n\nI honestly believe, if WE THE PEOPLE stood up and literally declared war against the United States, OUR military would support us. \n\nDo you honestly think the people in the military (we all know the Army in particular appeals to the poor and minorities) are going to kill their friends and family, or the cabal of elite giving them orders? \n\nEven for the sheer sake of efficiency, they would realize from a tactical standpoint *the military would have a far easier time destroying the elite than the proles.* \n\nThe American Military has been becoming very efficient in urban combat. Clearing homes, barricading neighborhoods, using security checkpoints to maintain perimeters around populated areas, using drones to sniff out people in hiding. \n\nBut the American people are more populated. Frankly, we have more guns. While there are those who say \"Guns don't much any good against tanks.\" they are correct. But when it's clear so many other nations have actively resisted American occupation with at least *some success* it is also clear to me that the American people would put up a considerable resistance to our own forces. I don't think the military would risk a war of attrition with themselves. We already know where all the supply chains are. We already know where all the munitions are housed. We *already work at all these places.* \n\nAnd make no mistake, the powers that be know this. The money that controls politicians, the money that manages multi-national political groups, the money that quite honestly owns the world. \n\nThis quote sums it up pretty nicely. \n\n&gt;Sadly, though I spent my entire life trying to believe it wasn\u2019t so, but violence not only is the answer, it is the only answer.  The cruel joke is that the really big chunks of shit at the top have known this all along and have been laughing, at and using this awareness against, fools like me all along.\n\n\nIt's very, very hard to honestly think you can destroy a paradigm that's sole power is invested in violence without at being *willing* to use it yourself.

Maybe the old guy isn't under arrest, maybe he is. He could very well be a bad person. The second cop stepped waaaaaaaay out of bounds with a 90 year old dude. That is a given. You can even tell from the body language of the first cop. He's like \"Fuck, Brian! I wanted you to grab his arm not fucking taze him. He's dead you idiot!\" That still makes both parties complete morons. Don't be 90 and give cops an in to perform hilarious tazer attacks. If you are a cop, you are supposed to be a bad ass. In the gym and jacked up so that you can lock shit down WITHOUT weapons. If you have to taze an old man, you are simply not needed on the force.\n\n\nWe still need everything in order to hate the proper person in this.

The remedy when police are bad at protecting people is one that the executive has the responsibility of implementing, by firing the police managers who refuse to implement better policy. The executive is elected to, among other things, protect his constituents. And when the executive fails at that, he gets voted out of office. A fairly effective remedy not just on paper but in practice too, if you ask me, because if there is one big problem with our current political climate on crime, it is that voters are too anxious to elect tough-on-crime executives.
