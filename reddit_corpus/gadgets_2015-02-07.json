At still other times, I may be looking at reddit for a minute here or there, and come across some short video that I'd like to watch, so it'd be nice to pause the playback on my iPad, and watch the video on my laptop.  It'd also be nice to have the occasional audio notification of an error, an incoming email, etc. from my laptop play back over the headphones as I listen to something from my other sources.  So basically, I want a device that would sit on my desk, pair with all of my devices, and act as a mixer or receiver without a lot of manual switching or plugging/unplugging required.  Do these things exist for normal human accessible prices?  ","aSentId": 17785,"answer": "You said that you already have a pair of bluetooth headphones. As of now, I haven't seen anything yet that can wirelessly connect multiple devices to the same set of headphones through bluetooth - right now, Bluetooth only allows for pairing between two devices at a time: one transmitting and one receiving. I read somewhere that it's a drawback of the technology, not the devices, so there's a chance that you might get it in the future.\n\nAlternately, there might be programs/apps you can download that let you use wifi to send audio output from one device to another. So you can connect your headphones to one device, and get your other devices to send their audio through the one that's connected; you get all three devices' audio signals coming from one device that your headphones are connected to. I've done it with android (but only between just my phone and laptop); I don't own any apple devices, so I'm not sure if you're able to do it without jailbreaking.\n\nThere's a solution which would (in theory) let you connect your headphones to two devices and have one device play sound through the left side and the other device through the right side. But even for that, you'd need to get 2 pairs of bluetooth receivers/transmitters and then use a normal pair of headphones (unless yours have a 3.5mm jack).

The fast zooms are on par with Sigmas older lenses... you know before Sigma learned how to make sharp lenses. They are good... but not great. I think the pancake primes are just too small. They are higher quality than the smart phones but not by enough to carry the NX300 + a smartphone. So as much as I hate lugging a DSLR I still do it if I want the quality.

How much?\n\nKeeping it cheap, or going balls out?\n\nWhat is more important: a workhorse camera that'll stick with you for years, or the best quality image?\n\nThe DSLR/Mirrorless filmmaking community definitely has fan boys, and they will generally recommend the best camera that fit THEIR needs. \n\nFor example, I recently picked up the NX1 and have been really enjoying it so far, as it fits my needs perfectly.  Couldn't really speak highly enough about it, color space is great right out of the camera, and the new firmware update really made it more useful as my A camera. But it has it's flaws, and it's definitely not something I'd recommend to people not already committed to heavy duty editing hardware/software. And the rolling shutter is pretty severe. Definitely would probably drive some DPs bonkers.\n\nThis NX500, if it really is going to be a mini Nx1, is going to have a lot of the same issues. And that workflow is a bitch right now (recording in h.265 is awesome for file size, but a pain in the ass for editing). \n\nThink about your needs, your workflow, and the time and money you can commit.
