From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked.\u2122  http://biblehub.com/niv/luke/12.htm\n\n\nThough I probably would argue that some of that was from the apostles, added after his death when they were exhorting his followers, cause I believe the parts of the gospels that refer to a time when Jesus was dead, were probably added after he was dead.", "aSentId": 33590, "answer": "It was all written after he was dead, dude.

The main issue is that they **haven't** been been 'forced', in a lasting and fundamental manner, to live all that peacefully in their new home, and forcing them to now is essentially declaring a civil war and it's something our corrupt political establishment is just not up to.  \n\nAlso, I really don't understand how you have made this equation; New Muslim arrivals + Existing Muslim communities = Less influence to Muslims, work.\n\nNow, you talk of deportation (dirty word to some but I'm not attaching any stigma to it) of individuals who do not adhere to the cultural mores of their host society... yeah, but what of their hypothetical, future children and then their children (who won't have a dual passport); are they to be deported too if they start applying certain Islamic tennants to their new neighbours? \n\n&gt;Just don't let em group up in one spot\n\nAlready happened; they live in enclosed, private communities that run parallel to our own. Now decimating these communities, though possible, is very much hindered if you start reinforcing these communities with more Muslims. People have this natural urge to be with their own kind and protect their communities from incursion; the natural desire of all living things, which modern 'leftist' find so abhorrent in the 'white' man. Thus trying to stop new arrivals joining these already existing communities would mean either barricading large areas inhabited by Muslims or putting new arrivals under a local arrest. Just... why?  \n\n&gt;On the other hand many closeted exmeese like myself wouldnt be able to escape to secular countries like Britian or America\n\nOh, I am so glad we exist simply as a new home for you...\n\n ", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13", "qSentId": 33912, "question": "Islam.", "aSentId": 33913, "answer": "It's not like this is sanctioned or written in the koran or anything.

In the Bible (both Old Testament and New) they outline how to treat your slaves.

Foreign slaves (those not of your tribe/ non-Hebrews) were slaves for life and could be passed down to your offspring as property. Obviously Jewish and Christian people don't go around saying slavery is condoned by the Bible. The Bible got slavery wrong as well as most of the stuff about rape. E.g. You don't command your daughter to marry her rapist, and a woman's honor isn't destroyed just because some rando raped her. Rapists aren't charged fines; they're brought to justice in court.

My personal favorite (after doing way to much research) is a living wage payed out to all persons and a flat tax exemption of some % value of this living wage (say 125% for this case). All money over this amount is taxed at the flat rate with a couple of exceptions:\n\n- Student Loan interest is a tax deduction\n\n- % of savings into an RRSP or TFSA are tax deductions (we still want to encourage people to save for things, rather then be in debt)\n\nThe flat tax rate can be something as high as 50%, or we can divide into 2 brackets - sub 100k, and anything over 100k. For this, I will go with a flat 50% for everything over 25k income. Doing a bit of searching, an income of about 60k is a good place to start.\n\n- Tax as dollar amount: 17.5k, as percent: 29.2%\n\n30% is a high amount to pay. In effect, the actual % payed will go up based on the amount of money you earned. But will never actually reach that% - it's an exponential curve. And provided you put some money away for your rainy day fund / buying a new car / wedding / house - non issue. your tax rate goes down further (not bad right?)\n\nBasically, the goal is to encourage saving for big ticket items, not go into debt which in the long run cripples individuals. Morgages and student loans, still a thing. Credit cards, sure, will still be a thing - but less relied on. And for debt based society to go away truly, we need to get rid of the \"I want that now\" mentality.\n\n**Regional Costs**\n\nTax exemption amount could be slightly adjusted for this as well as the living wage granted. But unlikely to be necessary to a large degree. People choose to live in certain area's. Encouraging people to move to potential locations for jobs based on potential increased buying power etc - maybe a good thing. There should be a benefit to living in a rural area, that respects increased costs related to getting certain services, goods and so on, or the higher distances needed to travel for certain things.\n\nWe really don't need to care more then 'what is the average cost of living'. Let people solve their own problems as people.\n\n**Encouraging work**\n\nClearly the cost of living should include basic necessities for the most part. Encouraging people to work would be a good idea. Two ways to do it - 1, reduce the living wage payment by 1$ for every 2$ earned. Provided this ratio nets them paying out some tax - the system becomes sustainable. And workers are encourages to find higher paying jobs, as they inevitably net a much better outcome.\n\nMinimum wage could be potentially scrapped entirely - or put at a much lower base rate. Employees would have a much easier time negotiating wages, especially with tools provided that give an idea of what the actual cost of business is.\n\n&gt;Flat tax is proven to do the opposite.\n\nIn most cases, yes. But it certainly does not need to.\n\n**Final Note**\n\nThis idea was mostly started as a theory craft, and requires refining. If you have idea's as to why or why it could not work - let me know. If you are curious about what sparked my interest in it, please ask.\n\n*~~My 2 Cents, Formes*", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13", "qSentId": 34548, "question": "Flat tax is proven to do the opposite.

If he is really fucking lucky he gets a trial which is not 100% secret but just 99%.\n\nIt will play out like a full media circus but it will be relatively short. He won't be allowed to present any evidence, he is lucky if he is allowed to even present any kind of defensive material at all. He won't be given the right to appeal and there won't be any cameras in the court room. All the names of the people except snowden's and his defending lawyers names will be secret and the whole ordeal will be sealed top secret for the maximum amount of years the law allows with only the penalty being given to the press. 500 years.\n\nIn the trial it will be shown how he has taken money from the russians and chinese, how he planned the attacks to be as devastating to the murican people as possible, how he sold the info and how he has millions and millions of dollars waiting for him on some secret bank account. Some poor bloke from nsa is thrown under the bus for not catching him do all this. There will be connection to some random terrorist organization just for kicks too. All lies but that's what the cia is for. They will find everything they need. And a lot more. A lot more.\n\nAs more and more lies are being presented as evidence the public opinion quickly becomes divided. Some people start stalking his lawyers and several attempts will be made towards them. There are constant death treats and there will be so much paper that for a legal team of 20 people it would take 100 years to find the truth in all that. Working inside bunker any kind of legal defense becomes impossible and the case falls apart for the defensive team when there is not enough time to go through the evidence and no chance to challenge any of the stuff presented by the prosecutor. His lawyers have to do all this while having a gag order placed on them. After first month snowden goes to hungerstrike but that info won't be let out either (national security).\n\nIn addition to long prison sentence he will be given life long ban to use any kind electronic computer, mobile phone or any kind of device that has an lcd screen. He will be forbidden to give interviews or have any connect to outside world except his own lawyers. Any kind of books or other stuff written by him is censored by court order on the basis of national security. He won't be even given a pen to sign documents given to him by his own lawyers.\n\nAfter couple of years he will finally hang himself in his cell. Obama makes that day the official day of celebrations and soon after there is some small drone killing crisis to avert attention away. The next president will come down on snowden hard and new stricter laws are introduced to avoid any kind of non-secret trials in cases like this.\n\nAs long as the nsa has as much unlimited power as it has now any kind of fair trial is impossible. Just like in china it would take massive shift in power away from the communist party for someone like snowden to get a fair trial. The thing is currently every high ranking american official wants him dead all the way from obama to the person cleaning the toilets in pentagon.

Iran was willing to come to the negotiating table for years, but found itself with an administration that sought complete capitulation for nothing in return. If history has taught us one thing, it is that Iran **never** responds positively to pressure. In reality, Iran's nuclear program only expanded in response to sanctions. Iran increased its centrifuge count from 3,000 to 19,000 and built a number of advanced centrifuges it didn\u2019t have back in 2005. Iran also increased enrichment to 20%. Sanctions are neither the reason for the breakthrough, nor the impetus behind Rouhani's eagerness to talk. If sanctions gave the United States more leverage, then it\u2019s also true that 19,000 centrifuges gave Iran additional leverage.

Its just not possible.\n* (America) BUT I WANNA INVADE. I WANNA ! Its not fair ?\n* (Me) Poor America, there was a time you could have invaded, after world war two, but since then you have cut down your army too much.\n* (America)  But they are just a bunch of filthy , ignorant, Arabs. I KNOW I can destroy them. Dumb evil people.\n* (Me) Its true you can do a lot of harm. And at the end of the day kill lots of them. But you are just going to piss them off.\n* (America) What ?\n* (me, gently)  Iran is twice the size of Iraq (size of Germany and France combined) and five times the population of Iraq, with a mobilized army of millions. It is a very strong country, even if it has been sanctioned.  You can't invade them with only the 500,000 of you and your allies. You will cause a lot of chaos, but ultimately you will have to retreat after a while.\n* ( America) But, I have lots of shiny toys. I can make them pay !\n* (me) Yes, but those toys do not secure territory. Something you suck at in Iraq and Afghanistan. And trying to do this will probably really harm your economy.\n* (America) But I beat Iraq's ass !\n* (me) You eventually had to pull out, defeated, you know. Every single one of your objectives was not met in that country, and you tried for twenty years and two wars.\n* (America) You mean I have to TALK to Iran??!! My friend Israel says I should bash them.\n* (Me) Netanyahu is a loon. You really should not listen to him. Even a lot of people who normally support him are saying he is crazy.\n* (America) But I WANT to bash them. CNN and FOX and others say we are the best.\n* (Me)  (Sigh)\n\nThank you, thank you.

Nice needless jab though.\n\n\nPerhaps if your comprehension skills were OK pay with your verbal regurgitation skills, you would have heard what his ideas were... \nFrom his speech:\n\n\nHe wants to stop Iran's work on advanced centrifuges, demolish nuclear facilities, stop relying on inspectors since inspectors can be tricked (he points out how it has happened three times so far) and can't enforce anything anyway, not allow the deal to expire in 10 years...\n\nWe can insist that restrictions on Iran's nuclear program not be lifted for as long as Iran continues its aggression in the region and in the world.\n\nBefore lifting those restrictions, the world should demand that Iran do three things. First, stop its aggression against its neighbors in the Middle East. Second...\n\nSecond, stop supporting terrorism around the world.\n\nAnd third, stop threatening to annihilate my country, Israel, the one and only Jewish state.\n\nIf the world powers are not prepared to insist that Iran change its behavior before a deal is signed, at the very least they should insist that Iran change its behavior before a deal expires.\n\nIf Iran changes its behavior, the restrictions would be lifted. If Iran doesn't change its behavior, the restrictions should not be lifted.\n\nIf Iran wants to be treated like a normal country, let it act like a normal country.\n\nMy friends, what about the argument that there's no alternative to this deal, that Iran's nuclear know-how cannot be erased, that its nuclear program is so advanced that the best we can do is delay the inevitable, which is essentially what the proposed deal seeks to do?\n\nWell, nuclear know-how without nuclear infrastructure doesn't get you very much. A racecar driver without a car can't drive. A pilot without a plan can't fly. Without thousands of centrifuges, tons of enriched uranium or heavy water facilities, Iran can't make nuclear weapons.\n\nIran's nuclear program can be rolled back well-beyond the current proposal by insisting on a better deal and keeping up the pressure on a very vulnerable regime, especially given the recent collapse in the price of oil.\n\nNow, if Iran threatens to walk away from the table -- and this often happens in a Persian bazaar -- call their bluff. They'll be back, because they need the deal a lot more than you do.\n\nAnd by maintaining the pressure on Iran and on those who do business with Iran, you have the power to make them need it even more.\n\nMy friends, for over a year, we've been told that no deal is better than a bad deal.

He was appointed by the Shah, the absolute monarch of Iran, after being nominated by the Majlis, a hardly democratic parliament.\n\nSecond, in 1951, he called for new elections. He knew his support base came from urban areas and not rural areas, and he stopped the voting as soon as he reached Parliamentry quorum with his party holding a plurality of the seats. The voting was then suspended indefinitely.\n\nThird, Mossadegh tried seizing power away from the Shah and appealed to the masses for popular support (which required him to work with the Mullahs) which in turn he used to get Parliament (the same one he set up) to grant himself emergency powers for six months. \n\nThose emergency powers were used to call for an extension of his emergency powers (never a good sign) and he implemented land reforms that collectivized a lot of the rural lands, which ended up angering the masses of which Iran was primarily rural.\n\nThe final straw was when he turned to the communists and lost the support of the mullahs (who got most of their power from the rural masses), which then pushed the Shah to support the US and British plan to overthrow Mossadegh. The entire \"nationalization of oil\" thing got their eyes on Mossadegh, but it wasn't the reason they finally sought to remove him from power.\n\nA bit of irony to all this too is that the Shah himself was finally deposed and a Islamic theocracy put in place which draws much of its support from the religious rural citizens of Iran.\n\n", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13", "qSentId": 38481, "question": "Need i remind everyone in this thread, if the U.S and Britain didn't overthrow the democratic elected Iranian Government in 1953, because they nationalized their OWN OIL, things like this could've been avoided.

Sharon acknowledged that Saddam Hussein was an \u201cacute threat\u201d to the Middle East and that he believed Saddam possessed weapons of mass destruction.\n\nYet according to one knowledgeable source, Sharon nevertheless advised Bush not to occupy Iraq. According to another source \u2014 Danny Ayalon, who was Israel\u2019s ambassador to the United States at the time of the Iraq invasion, and who sat in on the Bush-Sharon meetings \u2014 Sharon told Bush that Israel would not \u201cpush one way or another\u201d regarding the Iraq scheme.\n\nAccording to both sources, Sharon warned Bush that if he insisted on occupying Iraq, he should at least abandon his plan to implant democracy in this part of the world. \u201cIn terms of culture and tradition, the Arab world is not built for democratization,\u201d Ayalon recalls Sharon advising.\n\nBe sure, Sharon added, not to go into Iraq without a viable exit strategy.

An affidavit filed with the US court details that Ahmad used aliases to operate Azzam.com, a website supporting Chechen and Taliban fighters.

No such secular moral authority exists by which all agree. So what we end up with is a lot of individual moralities all claiming to be that true morality. Different source than religion, but similar result.\n\nMoral grandstanding is nothing more than a verbose way of saying I don't like it.\n\nI think people should abandon it, and abandon trying to figure out the right way of liking things, and instead start changing what they don't like. That's harder than feeling superior.\n\nAlso, if I'm roaming in a jungle inhabited by cannibals I'm not going to roam around in shorts and take pictures, no matter how morally superior I am.

The reason I defend the UAE is because as the country has grown it's human rights record has improved.

As little as 15 years ago construction workers used to sit on the back of trucks in the 50+ degree Celsius summer heat as if they were cattle being exposed to the elements (please imagine how bad that is) and had to work through the heat and commonly used to suffer heat stroke. No one cared though since everyone kind of lived a shitty existence. I remember almost passing out as a kid from playing in the summer heat on many occasions. As the city grew and developed the government started tackling the rampant abuse. They instituted laws where workers had to transported in enclosed vehicles (busses) and there has to be air conditioning. That people weren't allowed to work during the day when the sun was strongest in summer and they pushed most work schedules to night in the summer heat. They started fining companies that floured these rules and when that wasn't enough they named and shamed them. They forced companies to put employees in suitable accommodation. They instituted laws to help protect workers from employers that would withhold pay etc. The issue of workers paying a ton of money and being in debt to come to dubai isn't the uae governments fault since they don't allow recruitment companies in the uae to charge them but they can't control what happens in the workers home country. \n\nThe uae gets such a bad rap and it's one of the things I hate the most since it detracts from reasonable conversation that could lead to some good happening.

If someone's beliefs or culture isn't liberal and \"free\" to the nth degree, suddenly, it's a horrible place. At this point, I'm not even talking about OP's story - I'm talking about the comments. If you're going to another nation then adapt, you don't go there and then try to impose your own moral standards or culture there, that's just rude and disrespectful. That should go for anyone in any nation on the planet, first world or not.\n\n\nSure, it's \"oppressive\". But, the UAE is a testament to the efficiency of a religion to unite and organize a society. Nations without an organizer like great nationalism, religion, or sense of cultural identity (hispanics and slavs for example) will crash and burn to the ground real fast. Nations \"united\" by ideals, such as America (my home) will fall apart unless it can build nationalism or a cultural norm and identity. That's the reason we have so many problems right now - we've been telling people \"oh we're the melting pot, and excepting any and everything\" from outside and denying our own culture (and demonizing the time period that we actually had a distinct and legitimate one in) that we now have people who want to re-interpret what the original ideal was for their own devices, people who claim or think they want \"justice\" or whatever, but in reality will never sit down whether they get what they want or not because on the inside they just like drama and it makes them feel valuable for some reason, and you have people who want to destroy any and everything that was ever purely American in culture, yet want to support everyone else's culture. The end result of this is social chaos, and the only way that social chaos can be solved is to have a leader come in and say \"this is how things are gonna be, now sit down and stfu or else\" and hopefully they're a leader that's moderate/independent of the parties, but I don't see that happening too soon with the Koch Bros and bribing companies at play.\n\n\nThe EAU should be admired for their abidance by their culture, tradition, and the way this unifies them and allows them to achieve things and build those architectural marvels they have. It's a very successful and amazing nation. But, inevitably a liberal will get the urge to go in and \"fight for justice\", \"help\", or \"modernize\", because apparently, we can't let cultures exist that don't operate exactly in the most politically correct fashion.
