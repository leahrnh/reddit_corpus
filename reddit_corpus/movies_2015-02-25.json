If each studio, or group of studios, wanted to build out their own network, it would take a huge investment. Many studios already offer their own in-house streaming services, and they are terrible.

They were way in front of movie studios and then TV networks in making a major profit on digital content, but in the last few years traditional media companies have been working hard to figure out how to be their own distributors of digital content. Before, a movie studio could make a small amount of profit by licensing their content to Netflix without having to make any serious investments in new infrastructure and, at the time, without losing out much on traditional media. But as Netflix has risen, traditional outlets have foundered. The movie rental business has collapsed, and many people see increasingly little point in buying lots of movies when they can access much larger libraries for minimal cost online. Traditional companies have also begun making serious investments in infrastructure in the hopes that they will be able to make major profits from their properties. As they start trying to be their own digital distributors, they have zero incentive to contribute to Netflix's bottom line, and so either refuse to renew licenses on their properties at all or demand licensing fees high enough that Netflix has to be increasingly selective about what they make available at any given time. To be fair to Netflix, they realized this years ago, and decided, to take one specific example, that they had to become the equivalent of a digital HBO before HBO could become Netflix with a small stable of the best content. That's why we've seen Netflix coming out with high quality shows like House of Cards and Orange is the New Black, which are also catering to the love of binge-watching by being released all at once. The issue with all of this is that developing high quality TV is not easy (just look at how many shows get cancelled in their first season), it's often expensive (Game of Thrones cost $6 million per episode), and Netflix doesn't have the large pool of successful properties that traditional companies have ready made. It's also worth remembering that traditional media companies are heavily invested in the physical means of distribution and often have close relationships with the cable and internet providers, whereas Netflix has often had an adversarial relationship with them. For a long time Netflix was basically operating in a new market entirely by itself, but that's changing as more and more companies figure out how to use the internet effectively. Their strategy is going to be to have a large number of cheap properties licensed from elsewhere (some of which are crap, but lots of people like crap, and it could also include lots of cult, foreign, indie, and public domain films of varying quality), a small number of high price marquee films that they rotate based on viewership, and a small but growing stable of original content.", "aSentId": 521, "answer": "I'm digging what you wrote, but paragraphs, man, paragraphs!", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3s", "qSentId": 522, "question": "I'm digging what you wrote, but paragraphs, man, paragraphs!", "aSentId": 523, "answer": "TL:DR man TL:DR!", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3s", "qSentId": 520, "question": "I'm sure that if it were entirely up to them, they would be constantly adding content while removing very little.

In recent years Netflix has also competed to be the exclusive rights holder to air some American shows and so Netflix is the only place to watch Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul. In America obviously AMC want people to watch new episodes on their channel and so will not allow Netflix to broadcast it in the US otherwise people would just watch it on there.

Just look at their original content and that should hold you over for at least a couple months (House of Cards about to be 3 seasons, Lilyhammer 3 seasons, Hemlock Grove 2 seasons, Orange is the New Black about to be 3 seasons, Marco Polo, Bojack Horseman. Those are just the ones I liked and remembered.)  ", "aSentId": 776, "answer": "Sure, there is a lot of content. But when there is a specific movie I want to watch, odds are that it isn't there. And I'm not even talking new blockbuster movies. For example, I was planning on working through that AFI top 100 list of movies. I had already seen about 1/3, and Netflix had 7 out of the rest. And March 1, Netflix will have 1 less (The Graduate).", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3s", "qSentId": 777, "question": "Sure, there is a lot of content.

Even after paying they still don't have full time rights to anything. They make a deal to keep X show on their site for  Y amount of time and Z amount of money. They can't make this deal indefinite when all the power resides with the company that holds the licensing. Original content is how they are getting around that licensing, and FWIW, the original content on Netflix is all really good. Hemlock Grove is the only one on that list I couldn't finish. It got really weird and confusing after not having much go down to explain anything. I'd give it 2 stars and all the rest that I listed a 4 or 5. \n\nIt does suck to find that Netflix doesn't have the movie you want to watch, but they will always have something to watch. There are very few things I've watched on Netflix and outright hated. I also would have never watched even a percentage of the foreign films I've seen now if it were not for Netflix. If you want a service that gives you what you want to watch then pay the extra and get the physical copy of the show.

Costco does the same thing every company does. Unless you are talking about how they pay more/offer more benefits to their employees, but that is just because they hire less people than Sam's Club or Walmart and expect more out of them. When I left my Walmart position for a Costco position, I was amazed by the hiring process and the work expected out of me. I could do it, no problem, but it's a real job while Walmart really wasn't. I later had to leave because I wanted to begin college and they couldn't work part-time. Statistically, Costco brings in three times as much revenue per employee than Walmart does. But that's only because Walmart hires more and pays less for less work. Is Walmart gouging its employees by paying them less or is Costco gouging its employees for working more? My point is; its just price equilibrium.\n\nI don't understand your RWBY point. If small-time shops have no negotiating leverage anyway, why would making Netflix the only service help them at all? They don't benefit from multiple or one buyer - because they haven't produced a show that holds much value for Netflix or Amazon. Take Amazon away, and they have even less negotiation leverage.\n\nEverything you watch does lower the value of Netflix, you're right. It also lowers the value of the show. Maybe if Amazon still thinks the show is worth as much as it was before Netflix, they could trade! CEOs are creators, too, man. Do you think that the Avengers got their budget through crowdsourcing or do you think the Marvel/Disney CEOs thought \"hey! we could totally make some money out of this, let's invest $600million!\". Without CEOs and fatcats, most films would be made exactly the same way independent films are made.

", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3s", "qSentId": 1347, "question": "So here's the thing. Netflix is threatening to disrupt the exiting models that the industry relies upon to create a large incumbent base of fees. The bad thing about this industry is that Netflix is at the mercy of these people. For example, Time Warner Cable - a competitor - owns HBO, Turner Broadcasting,- this includes all CNN properties and Cartoon Network - Warner Brothers, - this is Newline Cinemas and Studios - Warner TV Group - CW and The WB. People who believe that the majority of the profits with TV are driven by advertising are wrong. Most of the stable revenue comes from a large base of subscribers that can't cancel their subscriptions to get out of their serfdom even if they cut up their credit cards. With $22.12 billion at stake is it any surprise that these people that these people are kicking and screaming over being dragged into the 21st century?\n\nBecause these incumbents are scared, they are now trying to gut content from Netflix to turn it into a lemon, because Netflix is that good at its game. TV networks are constrained in the number of shows they can air not because of monetary reasons, but because all shows compete for time slots. Everything has to fit within one stream of information that is beamed to people's homes. Plus the costs of transmitting a minute of content across this system will always remains more or less constant. They pay for the equipment costs no matter how many people are watching on the other end, so this logically devolves into a lowest common denominator fight, as they have every reason to ignore the long tail Other than cases where smaller upstarts try to be contrarian, the focus seems to be on producing content for as large as an audience as possible. Combined with fierce competition from other networks all vying for attention you get modern television, which really does turn your brain off. (that's why I don't watch TV)\n\nNetflix on the other hand uses a different medium to transmit content. It's servers can scale up to millions of parallel, unique streams of information, streaming content to users. As everything is on demand, there isn't an independent fixed cost of broadcasting a show. A piece of content either gets watched by a user somewhere with the server streaming them content, or it sits in a hard-drive somewhere trying to reconcile with the fact no one wants it. This immediately changes the equation. In this scenario broadcasting a piece of content doesn't cannibalize another. Plus given that the cost of distribution is a factor of the shows popularity, Netflix can address the long tail profitably even within its content creation. This means that there will be an explosion of content tailored to niches like FireFly. Properties that just wouldn't make sense anywhere else and thus attracting a lot of viewers. This is scary for the Time Warner execs and so they are playing dirty.\n\nAnother thing that's scaring them is that the studios can't readily replicate this. It's hard to be Netflix. Streaming all of this content efficiently and effectively at scale is harder than it looks and Netflix does have a major technological advantage over here. Another advantage stems from the user experience side. It is very hard for them to not use their outdated views of how consumers need to behave to dictate how their apps work - for instance you can't output HDMI if you're using HBO Go, which just doesn't make any sense. So faced with this disruption they are just trying to kill Netflix. Which ain't gonna happen.\n\ntl;dr: Netflix's catalogue is shrinking not because they are incompetent or stupid. But because existing cable companies who own these properties feel the heat and are threatened by this disruptor.", "aSentId": 1348, "answer": "Competition for time slots?

Whereas for Netflix, multiple people can watch different shows at variable times on-demand. That changes the economics of their offering.\n\nMost of the on-demand offerings by studios are poorly executed in terms of cacheing at local nodes - Netflix has its own CDN - and the infrastructure of studio alternatives does not use open standards, making them a poor overall experience and bet.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3s", "qSentId": 1352, "question": "Couldn't have said it better.

I haven't seen Gadot or Fisher in anything, so can't really comment on them.\n\nAll these guys could easily prove me wrong and turn out to be great, but most of them aren't true to their comic versions at all in terms of appearance and personality.

But it's just a little sad that they don't have faith in their own characters, who have been ridiculously popular for decades. And the fact that Snyder is still a part of this is also very discouraging.\n\nI think the reason I hate Warner Bros.' approach and am not excited by anything they are doing is the same reason why I am not looking forward to the new Fantastic Four either. They aren't carefully cultivating something like Marvel Studios is doing, they are trying to pump out as many movies as possible and trying to go for a wider audience by making it darker. With their casting choices, they are taking characters from other stuff and adding their own character's name onto it (Luthor will be Zuckerberg, Aquaman will be Khal Drogo). Fantastic Four is even more shameless, they made Reed Richards into a typical nerd character instead of making him the older, wise character from the comics.\n\nI don't care for accuracy and I don't care if they take a darker tone, I just dislike style over substance (which also happens to be Snyder's MO). I'll take a well thought out plot, some good dialogue, and themes that actually interpret what the titular character is all about (like in Batman Begins and Dark Knight) over edgy characters involved in lots of explosions (like in Man of Steel).

These could range from piano reductions to scattered instrument parts for certain moments (say he REALLY wants a trumpet solo somewhere). He may also include chord changes and such. Every composer is different. They'll also receive clips of the movie, so they can time certain moments and create the mood.\n\nFrom here, it's up to the arrangers to work their magic. Mind you, you don't just work for Zimmer because you're good. You have to be the best of the best. And he won't even take someone amazing and just let them reign loose on his work. They're trained extensively on what exactly a \"Zimmer\" piece sounds like.\n\nSo no, the themes you hear are not altered.
