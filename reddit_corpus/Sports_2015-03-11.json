To the non-football fan viewer it looks like they are just waiting around for the ball to be hiked when in reality they are sparring off in a chess match.\n\nTo a football guru the time between plays is intense. Which personnel are on the field? You have 2 running backs, 2 receivers and a tight end on the field? That limits the options of the offense. The WR both line up on the right, again another limitation. Where the RB are relative to the QB matters too. The defense sees all of this and makes an adjustment to cover what they think is probably coming. The QB sees this adjustment, realizes the defense just shifted into a zone coverage scheme he saw earlier in the game and knows there is a weak spot so he calls and audible and changes the play. The tight end shifts and before the defense has a chance to react the QB hikes the ball. The two receivers run their routes but, due to the opponents zone coverage, pick up three defenders leaving an empty area of the field that the tight end runs into for a great catch and a first down. \n\nRinse and repeat.\n\nNow, most fans aren't gurus to see all of that happening and know all of the plays with their strengths and weaknesses, but even a casual fan will pick up tons of information between the plays as to what is about to come. They may not understand the intricacies of what just happened but they can pick up the subtle cues and see where the ball is likely going. \n\nFurthermore, for the casual fan these breaks between plays give plenty of time for replays. There is so freaking much going on each and every play that it is impossible to watch all of it. If you just watch the ball and what is going on around it you are missing 90% of the important stuff. Replays allow you to catch up on what you missed in the split second crazy. \n\nTL;DR: the breaks between plays are as much a part of football as the actual plays themselves.

If the ball is caught after you hit it, you're also out. When you hit the ball, you have to run, same as baseball. Each run between the two wickets is worth one point. If you hit the ball past a certain line without it hitting the ground, you get an automatic 6 points, in a similar vein to getting a home run. If you hit it past that line after it hits the ground, you get an automatic 4 points. There's not really an equivalent to that but it's simple enough.\n\nThe only real extra thing would be the wickets, and even then it's pretty much the equivalent of \"one strike and you're out\" versus three. You don't often want to hit the ball behind you as it's easier for the other team to catch the ball.\n\nI think once you get into it, it's not really as different as you think it is, much like NFL probably isn't as different as I think it is.

I have seen plenty of people win by going from the start of the race, it's an old school tactic that some still don't expect. \n\nAlthough drafting is an important factor, over such a short distance it doesn't mean as much as an advantage. Riding slow forces your opponent to tire themselves (reactionary cycling manoeuvres on such a large gear can really hurt) or even risks themselves to make a mistake. It may not appear steep but velodromes are, riding slow and out manoeuvring your opponent not only hurts the confidence of your opponent but also their legs.  \n\nIt's really all just a mind game.  \n\nSource: Match Sprinter", "aSentId": 7838, "answer": "yeah it seemed any drafting advantage would be negligible over such a short distance", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qgzy", "qSentId": 7839, "question": "yeah it seemed any drafting advantage would be negligible over such a short distance", "aSentId": 7840, "answer": "Drafting is an up to 30% savings in power output from the second rider at the same speed.
