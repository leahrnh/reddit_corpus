The smaller radius makes the risk more accurate. \nTor:con today said a 30-40% chance of a tornado, while NWS said 5% chance. Granted, 5% is still high for that area and caution should still be used. Also, NWS will delineate any area where they think there could be significant tornadoes (EF2 or stronger).
