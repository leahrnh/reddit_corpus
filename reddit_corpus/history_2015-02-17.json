There is no consistency. \n\nSome organizations have a mandate to maintain buildings as they received them and only do what is required to keep them from deteriorating: The U.S. National Park Service. What you see is as close as possible to what the National Park service was handed. But the Park service has to deal with what was done before they got handed the property. Ft. Sumter is great example. During the Civil War it was blasted into piles of rubble. Then rebuilt by the Union Army. Then filled in and had a massive concrete gun battery poured across it about 1900.  Some walls remain from the Civil War, they even still have shells embedded in them. Some were rebuilt with new brick after the destruction. Others torn down later or buried or covered over all before the park service got the fort. So is it the Civil War era fort everyone wants to see or something else?\n\nOther groups are rebuilding things to X state with a complete disregard for later or earlier usage. The Parthenon in Athens is being rebuilt to a pre-1687 state, despite the fact that parts of it are in Britain, the 1687 state was after it had been used as temple, church and mosque. The pre-1687 date was chosen because in 1687 it was blown up. The structure was being used to store gunpowder and it was shelled.

There is no consistency. \n\nSome organizations have a mandate to maintain buildings as they received them and only do what is required to keep them from deteriorating: The U.S. National Park Service. What you see is as close as possible to what the National Park service was handed. But the Park service has to deal with what was done before they got handed the property. Ft. Sumter is great example. During the Civil War it was blasted into piles of rubble. Then rebuilt by the Union Army. Then filled in and had a massive concrete gun battery poured across it about 1900.  Some walls remain from the Civil War, they even still have shells embedded in them. Some were rebuilt with new brick after the destruction. Others torn down later or buried or covered over all before the park service got the fort.

To quote another:\n\n&gt; Tolstoy did use quite a few primary sources to help establish the framework of the novel and to ensure the history was correct, but these elements are more functional than anything else. By that, Tolstoy used those primary sources to make sure he had dates, uniforms and the like correct as well as the overall flavor and setting of the French invasion. A good portion of the book contains his own moralizing and philosophical musings, so I would argue that this colors the entire book and perhaps clouds any historical facts. Having certain themes and ideas he wanted to illustrate or muse through in the book would cause him to focus on certain events, or fictionalize others to make his point, so again, it should not be read as a history text.

Roman emperors never called themselves \"kings\", almost to the end they maintained the pretense that they were \"first citizens\" - princeps (from where we get the title Prince), or more often, Caesars, of the empire.\n\nImperator, from where we get emperor, wasn't a particularly prestigious title - it just means commander, and could refer to any general in the field - we call the Caesars \"emperors\" just by convention, since the language is more familiar to us. They would've called themselves Caesars.\n\nRome had been a republic for nearly 500 years, and even until the end the Romans liked to maintain the pretense that they were a republic - the emperor/Caesar usually took care to avoid presenting himself as a flashy emperor or King with a crown and throne and all that - those were considered Oriental/Eastern. Importantly, the Romans never quite accepted the idea of Caesars being hereditary (which would reek of monarchy), and this caused many, many civil wars when Caesars didn't choose a worthy successor.\n\nHowever, in the Eastern Empire, emperors gradually abandoned the old trappings of Rome and embraced the pomp and ceremony of an Eastern emperor. The Senate became much less important, and the emperor wore a crown, sat in a throne and otherwise embraced all the pomp and circumstance of royalty. The title of emperor gradually became hereditary, like a traditional monarchy (of course there was always a lot of intrigue around the succession).\n\nDifferences: Most of the Western Empire spoke Latin, while most of the East spoke Greek. The West was always much poorer and less sophisticated than the East, with fewer cities, less commerce, wealth and education. The East had a far more ancient civilization than the West (the histories of Egypt, Syria, Mesopotamia and Greece being hundreds, even thousands of years more ancient), and they profited enormously from trade with the Far East (Persia, India and China, which all passed through cities like Constantinople).\n\nThe differences between the Latin West and the Greek East are so vast historians use terms like \"Eastern Roman\" or \"Byzantine\" to distinguish them, but as far as they were concerned they were still Romans.","aSentId": 54569,"answer": "Very interesting, thank you!

I live on the East Coast best time to visit would be the summer since we don't have any tall mountains for skiing and our Winters are very wet its not the best. If you want food though prepare your stomach, St. John's and Halifax are both going through culinary revolutions at the moment and there are tons of options in both places. Also, the Maritimes has some nice beaches (colder than down south) and Newfoundland has rugged coastlines, like Ireland or Norway.\n\nPEI - Anne of Green Gables and Potatoes\n\nNew Brunswick - No Funswick\n\nOntario and Quebec have some great cities, if your looking for old world feel try Quebec City and Ottowa. If your looking more metropolitan try Toronto or Montreal. Montreal is usually recommended since its kind of in between and a very international city. Theres also tons to do outside in the Winter or Summer.\n\nManitoba - ponds and lakes\n\nThe Prairies are just big open spaces, amazing to look at during a thunderstorm. Lots to do outside in the summer, no major metropolitan areas till you hit Calgary which is on the edge. Pretty harsh winters and being flat theres not mucb to do in terms of downhill skiiing (but maybe skidooing and cross country).\n\nThen theres the Rockies, probably my favorite part. They are breathtaking if you haven't grown up around mountains. Driving through them I was constantly looking out the window. The towns have a certain character to them and then theres the ski resorts which are even great in the summer. Banff has a lot to see, and Lake Louise. Then the Mountains open up to the Okanagan which is great to visit in the Summer, beaches and vinyards everywhere.\n\nHaven't been as far as Vancouver yet but hoping to go this Summer.\n\nEdit: and just to add to all the Winter comments. A forcast for 30-40cm of snow does not guarantee a snow day in Canada, you might just have to wake up early to shovel. -30 degrees they just tell you to cover up.

Under the Japanese, palaces, temples, and everything that told the story of Korea's past - including the Korean language itself - was either destroyed or at least tried to be destroyed. This meant that, yes, after the Japanese left and the Korean War ended, there was very little material history left. \n\nHowever, I wouldn't say that this means there was a disconnect from Korea's history and culture. Traditional practices are still very much done, and in the 80s, there were restorations of destroyed sites and a renewed interest in cultural recreations and ensuring that Korean culture survived. I'd say that today, Korea is very aware of its history and devoted to preserving its culture rather than being detached. I think that sometimes this is a romanticised view of culture, but it's a far stretch from not having an awareness of its history of culture in the first place.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh53","qSentId": 54941,"question": "How have the tragedies of South Korea's 20th century history defined its historical narrative and modern identity?","aSentId": 54944,"answer": "Koreans had long been somewhat under the thumb of China for many centuries - had their own internal issues, and on occasion had to deal with Japan even before the 20th century.\n\nHow do you think S. Korea is 'detached' from their own history and culture? It's not as if they're like the Aztecs or Incas who had probably 95% of their culture wiped out.\n\n","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh53","qSentId": 54946,"question": "Researchers use isotopic analysis to explore ancient Peruvian life","aSentId": 54947,"answer": "Bioarchaeologists and archaeologists have been able to study the diets of 14 individuals dating back almost 2,000 years.
