The expected results would theoretically due to evolution get 100% recombined DNA.\n\nMy theory, is that Jockeys are a later step in human evolution.

Do you really think a film that is billed as a \"reimagining\" of Alien is going to turnout well when the last really good Alien movie was made in 1986? Hell, the goddamn godfather Ridley Scott couldn't even make a prequel that was anything more than mediocre. His interpretation of Giger's work looked more like on ode to the faded past than an original or refreshing concept. \n\nBut fuck those points. Perhaps you love Blomkamp and believe in him wholeheartedly. Maybe you can't wait to see a young directors take on the franchise. Fair enough. But when can we stop rehashing the same franchises?

It's not necessarily just 'subtext' that can make a movie inaccessible to a mainstream audience, though of course that's definitely one factor. I wouldn't say, for example, that the film Lost in Translation had much subtext to it, but I still would not call it an accessible film. It's inaccessible because it does not place much focus on the aspects of filmmaking that conventional Hollywood films do (one main one being 'plot').\n\nMy argument wasn't that people who don't appreciate films like Birdman dislike it simply because they don't have the skill to read the film's subtext, or understand the film's themes. That may be a factor, but more fundamentally I believe that your taste in film (or any art form) is a genuine journey (or mineshaft, or mountain, etc. - pick your favourite analogy) and it simply isn't possible to leap straight from point A (accessible films) to point H (relatively inaccessible films).\n\nSo to use an example: I have a very basic and very boring taste in food. I don't have a huge amount of variety in my diet, and the stuff I enjoy eating mainly comes from my own country and culture. I am well aware that I don't have the appreciation for certain dishes that so many people do. I haven't yet had the time or inclination to broaden my taste in food, but nonetheless I fully believe that if I did invest the time in trying new foods and inching out of my comfort zone, I could eventually reach the stage where I would appreciate complex dishes from all around the world.\n\nBroadening your taste is a time-commitment. People who appreciate less conventional (or subtext-laden) films are not 'more intelligent' than those who don't; they've just (for whatever reason) been able to invest more time into expanding their filmic diet (apologies for using that image again: but the culinary metaphor seems the most appropriate when discussing 'taste'). This is essentially what I'm trying to express, and I admittedly I haven't yet found a way of expressing it which doesn't rub people up the wrong way in very mainstream subreddits like /r/movies, which contain (and I mean this in a purely objective - not derogatory - way) quite a lot of people under the age of 15.

He must of gone somewhere, however the only time we saw that was during his flight of the city. And a film that was so continuously shot I refuse to believe that we just weren't shown something. \n\nNo, in fact I believe we were shown everything necessarily. He did go somewhere, however he took a taxi back (because you can't fly through your front doors). The rest was a fantasy, as he was only partially free. \n\nThat aside, I believe that the voice in his head was his inner struggle and was in fact himself. The costume stuff was his alter ego.
