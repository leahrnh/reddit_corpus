What a miserable life you seem to think I should lead...)", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2fwo", "qSentId": 61797, "question": "I'm a bit late to the party, but here's my thoughts/experiences, because this article rubbed me the wrong way:\n\nI work for a mid-largish software company. I'm not overly fond of the company as a whole - it's full of hostile project managers, incompetent developer teams, and way too much politics.\n\nRegardless of how I feel about the company, I feel like the things I work on have a direct and immediate impact on both the company's success, and improve our customer's lives. I feel they pay me fairly for the work I do, and am fortunate to be in a position where I can either avoid most of the bad aspects of the company, or have a large say in those aspects' impact on me and my team. Additionally, I love the immediate team I work on (including my boss), and the software we write - they're a bunch of awesome people, and we write a bunch of awesome stuff.\n\nI sometimes work perhaps an extra 5 hours every other week or so. I maybe put in 1 Saturday or Sunday every 3-4 months. I realize this comes nowhere close to the 50-60 hours/week horror stories some of you talk about, but it is time I take out of my \"personal time\" to work on \"company time\". I feel absolutely no regret about doing this, but I also feel absolutely no obligation or expectation to do this. I only do it if I want to, and certainly not if I'm feeling burnt out.\n\nI feel my willingness to work extra hours largely comes down to trust and respect. I've worked with this team for two years now, and I feel like we have achieved a mutual respect and trust that we've got each other's backs when it comes to working on our software (and just working in this company). I trust that by putting in a little extra time when I feel like it or when I deem it necessary to finish my work in a timely manner, my coworkers and boss will not abuse that by expecting me to do it regularly. In fact, my boss regularly offers me comp time in exchange for time I put in over the weekend or for late nights, and is more than willing to grant me PTO in the middle of our team being swamped, just because \"work shouldn't get in the way of doing what we want to do\".\n\nAnother aspect of this is that I truly do like working on the things I do at work, and that it largely intersects the same types of projects I'd be hacking at in my free time anyways. I'm fortunate that most of my work feels more like paid personal time than boring labor. Working on \"work\" outside of work isn't such a big deal because of this. Again, though, outside of the standard 40 hour work week, actual non-work personal time always takes precedence over work time.\n\nFinally, there's the matter of how much you feel your company is paying compared to the work you put in. This is wildly subjective, but I do believe there's some wiggle room between what you're getting paid and how much time you're expected to work. Yes, of course only ever working the minimal amount of time nets your the most money for the time you spend working, but that's not all there is for some people. In my case, I believe that what I get paid justifies spending a little extra time above and beyond the 40 hours per week. Or maybe I get paid what I do _because_ I spend a little extra time above and beyond the expected 40 hours per week. Either way, there is a limit. Maybe I'll do a 50 hour week twice a year because some deadlines are coming up and we're behind. But I'll outright refuse to do three of those in a row, or even put in a single 60 hour week. I **don't** believe my pay justifies that. Some people, like the author, believe their pay only ever justifies 40 hours a week, but That's Okay; like I said, this is wildly subjective, and completely up to each person.\n\nSo, getting back to the article: Maybe Luis isn't feeling pressured to work on it over the weekend, maybe he doesn't feel like he's wasting time. Maybe this particular bug is just really interesting for him to work on, and that's truly what he wants to spend his time on, and That's Okay. Maybe Luis feels he gets paid enough that he feels alright putting in an extra day or two. Or maybe all of Luis' friends are out of town this weekend, he's caught up on all the TV he's watching, he's burnt out on playing video games, and he truly doesn't have anything better to do for a few hours on Saturday.\n\nI feel more and more people like this author are railing against people that work outside of work, like somehow they're being pressured into it, or that they should have better things to do with their lives, and that either makes them a victim or a \"loser\" (that's a bit of a strong word, but I can't think of a better one). There's definitely developers out there being pressured into working longer hours - that's not good. There's definitely developers out there that pour way too much of their time into their work, for no significant or even comparable return on that investment. I'm not talking about these people.\n\nMaybe people shouldn't be so judgmental about what qualifies as \"better things to do with their lives\", or draw such a black/white line between personal and company time.

I've been at the same gig for 10+ years.  Started as a very small engineering shop in a really competitive field.  We were literally fighting some of the largest tech companies in the world.  The only way we could compete was on release pace.  We could ship 2x faster than the larger companies which meant we were able to release innovation 2x faster.  The larger companies were working on the same stuff but we got to market much faster with it.  Eventually one of the larger companies purchased us and it worked out quite well for the devs that were there for 2+ years.\n\nyeah, our schedules were nasty, we had several months long death marches, but we won.  We knew we were winning.  Everyone had a piece of the company and after a few rocky years in the beginning we all knew that the place would end up successful and we'd get a part of that success.\n\nWe pay pretty well. We have other rewards programs within the company, and our bonuses are really good.  Some folks still work a ton of hours, I work a ton of hours.  I've been a manager for a little over 5 years, and yeah, I reward the folks that put in extra hours to make sure things are ready on time. I don't punish those who don't.  I have pretty flexible hours, and if someone needs to knock off early to go do something, or get away from the office for a bit, I generally allow it  (as long as it's not getting abused).  \n\nI guess my point is, yes, we have a work culture that encourages people to work as much as they need to hit their dates.  Yes, folks still work weekends.  All of that said, when I needed to leave early 2 days a week to help coach my kid's soccer team, no one cared.  If I need to come in late, I can.

Now when I did this, I had only used Pharo for about year at an application level, never digging under the covers (since on other systems that stuff is typically difficult and outside your application),  but while tracking down an application bug with Pharo's outstanding debugger I suddenly found myself at those depths and following it easily.  \n\nBeing able to develop the underlying system with the same tools you develop your applications really makes it feasible to gain personal mastery of the whole system - but its the usual story of \"with great power comes great responsibility\".  As a newbie you trip over a few of these the same way you fall in a few pot holes walking across an unknown field in the dark - but you soon learn which parts to be careful of.  If you hit such issues at the application level that is a bug, and if reported should get a fix.\n\n&gt; The method versions interface is nice. I can't remember ever having a problem with that... but don't delete/rename the method etc. \n\nYes deleting the method means you lose the old versions of it.  That should be improved.", "aSentId": 62238, "answer": "&gt;  The equivalent would be modifying the code in your OS graphics driver and installing it. You might not be able to recover and need to reinstall the whole OS.\n\nI take it you haven't done much at this level? If you compile a custom kernel and immediately throw out the old one without even trying it then you're really asking to \"reinstall your whole OS\" (or maybe take a working kernel from elsewhere). But there are very good reasons your OS separates /bin and /usr/bin/ and /usr/local/bin/, and why compiling a new kernel doesn't automatically destroy the old ones.. It's so you can easily recover. Even from dramatically fucking the kernel and or the user space, without loosing data! \n\nNaturally the same applies to kernel modules.\n\nIf you're not going out of your way to fuck your system (assuming you have a basic understanding of how your OS works, which since you're messing around with the graphics drivers seems like a given) you're relatively safe to play with anything you want.\n\nSmalltalk makes no attempt to make development safe even though it has been clear for decades that you can have both [1], and there are Forth and Lisp systems that make modification easy as Smalltalk, without the risk of catastrophic losses. Hell even Smalltalkers have recognised this, and there have been Smalltalk environments that operate on images from the outside so that a misbehaving application can't take down the development environment.\n\nAlas that was a time when people were interested in improving Smalltalk instead of carefully preserving all of it's failings... uh... I mean... features.\n\n&gt; When I started exploring and playing with Pharo I put a logic error in the main UI rendering loop\n\nI've had similar issues, setting a processes priority :).\n\nThere's also the problem of throwing an exception and or trying to debug a multi-process program. Which is one of many nightmares that the admittedly very good Smalltalk debugger typically can't wake up from. There are so many ways that you can quickly find yourself with hundreds errors windows  (which is so common that there's an option to delete all such windows...)\n\nNaturally this applies when playing with anything in the UI run loop hehe.\n\n&gt; Being able to develop the underlying system with the same tools you develop your applications really makes it feasible to gain personal mastery of the whole system \n\nThis sentiment obviously applies to using the same tools you use to develop your application for modifying your OS, but it will always be ignored because it's convenient when talking about how awesome Smalltalk is to ignore just how similar these things are (Smalltalks talking-points only work when you compare it to \"dead\" languages and ignore the living system that they exist within - if you compare Smalltalk the language, without the system, then basically every other language wins...)\n\n[1] Productivity/hackability and safety.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2fwo", "qSentId": 62233, "question": "I'm really surprised to see someone defending this aspect of Squeak/Pharo :).\n\nI haven't really used Pharo since version 2.0 but I've been using Smalltalk in general for a long time (including professionally) and I can state unequivocally that you absolutely CAN \"break your system in a way that you cannot revert back\". The changes tools are absolutely terrible, source files have on occasion become corrupt, filing in classes (rarer these days) has caused all manor of problems, and I've found myself in a broken image enough times that before I stopped programming in Smalltalk I had directories filled with hundreds of slightly different 50-100MB images.

Other than Monticello/Metacello, which have their own problems, and have also become unloadable on occasion, it's the only way to guarantee that you can recover.\n\nThat is to say: let your operating system take care of this (by creating lots and lots of image **files**) because your Smalltalk wont!\n\nNOW.

(yes you can type the code out and execute it but that's hardly obvious)\n\nAnd be careful what you type into the various search fields.. you're probably not going to get what you're expecting. In that case right clicking and looking for something that actually does the search you want is probably the way to go. It takes some time but you will learn where things are... no matter how illogically they're placed..\n\nYou may well try out the dark theme, but don't be surprised if you then can't read some of the white text appearing on white backgrounds.\n\nEDIT: closing all of the windows does seem to help wit this one.\n\nSimilarly there's a general use of icons even though the chosen icons make absolutely no sense... making them useless at best.\n\nNaturally, since this is Smalltalk, and everything is an Object, you shouldn't be surprised to find things, like Process scheduling, distributed through a large area in the system. You might ask, where's the algorithm? And the answer is of course \"everywhere\". There's a bit here. And a bit there. And a few other extensions over in that corner. That's unlikely to change.. \n\nAnyway, take these criticisms with a grain of salt. These are just my oppinions, having spent the last hour and a half playing with it. Overall I'm quite impressed with this release. It's not enough to make me want to use Smalltalk again but it's a stepping stone.\n\nWhat I would like to know is how this image was built? Now that we have the new compiler etc. and after more than a decade of effort on various fronts, are we now able to bootstrap from sources? Is building the virtual machine any less of a headache?

One is discovery / prototyping / exploring a problem domain. \nBasically, it has an AMAZING debugger. The live-coding and live-debugging experience (where you can set breakpoints, change code in various objects/functions which instantly get re-compiled while the debugger is still running, etc), is pretty much unmatched in the programming world. I've found it way more pleasant and powerful to debug things (and close-loop iteratively develop) in Smalltalk than in Java, Ruby, Python, JS, Erlang or Lisp. (Don't even get me started on what a sorry state breakpoints and debugging is in Ruby, a language that I very much love). Same thing with code browsing and code discovery.

However, the standard RISC-V encoding scheme is designed to support ISA extensions with variable-length instructions, where each instruction can be any number of 16-bit instruction parcels in length and parcels are naturally aligned on 16-bit boundaries. The standard compressed ISA extension described in Chapter 13 reduces code size by providing compressed 16-bit instructions and relaxes the alignment constraints to allow all instructions (16 bit and 32 bit) to be aligned on any 16-bit boundary to improve code density.\n\n&gt; Figure 1.1 illustrates the standard RISC-V instruction-length encoding convention. All the 32-bit instructions in the base ISA have their lowest two bits set to 11. The optional compressed 16-bit instruction-set extensions have their lowest two bits equal to 00, 01, or 10. Standard instructionset extensions encoded with more than 32 bits have additional low-order bits set to 1, with the conventions for 48-bit and 64-bit lengths shown in Figure 1.1. Instruction lengths between 80 bits and 304 bits are encoded using a 4-bit field giving the number of 16-bit words in addition to the first 5\u00d716-bit words. Encodings with 11 or more low-order opcode bits set to 1 are reserved for future longer instruction encodings.\n\nIt seems mostly theoretical at the moment as smaller chips will probably use 16/32-bit (like MIPS16e and ARM Thumb) and larger chips will use the base 32-bit only (once again like MIPS and ARM).

I've already seen, heard, and read about many game development shops not working with the STL due to the implementations of the STL being completely unaware of the requirements of game development.

Mike Acton from Insomniac Games, as well as many other developers in this industry, share all of these concerns, and for that reason I don't believe Insomniac uses the STL either. \n\nHowever, generally speaking, from a language standpoint, the standard can't do much more than what it is doing now. It is a *language specification* after all, not a compiler design document. I concede that it does suck that EA had to write their own implementation of the STL (along with their own extensions) due to the shortcomings of the STL, but the STL is not going to be the best solution for *every single use case*; it seems like this is impossible to achieve practically speaking. We can restrict asymptotic running times as much as we want, but we can't tell the compiler vendor : \"Hey! Don't use any function calls in your algorithms! Do everything inline!\" It really depends on the implementation is what I'm trying to get at.\n\nAlso, from purely a language standpoint (i.e from knowing nothing about the underlying hardware) we can't put performance ahead of correctness for anything.
