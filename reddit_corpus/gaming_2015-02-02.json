You can fight inside your group and go for domination but it destroys the reason behind the gameplay. Which is to overthrow either the shogunate or imperial forces. \nShogun 2's base game was strong, lots of clans, lots of unique units, lots of different ways to play strategy wise. \nFoTS focused more on the samurai's last stand and the vast changes in Japanese culture and combat than the overall concept of dominating japan. \nIf you want explosions and fireworks, play FoTS it's more combat oriented and you can have a blast between naval artillery and mowing down samurai with riflemen. \nIf you want a long drawn out fight for the shogunate and a hell of a time trying to get there without starving your troops to death or having revolts or diplomatic issues, play the classic. \n\nIf you want more development focused and diplomatic based gameplay get rise of the samurai. \n\nSo FoTS is more combat oriented instead of managing individual provinces and dealing with issues like revolts and food issues.\n\nShogun 2 base is more the middle man and focuses on a mix of balancing resources and warfare. \n\nRise of the samurai is more development based and lighter combat with less unique units.

After time starts flowing and three days and three nights pass, the beast essentially dies and leaves behind nothing but the armor. The protagonist uses the armor and carves out Majora's Mask, sealing the \"terrible power\" it had within it.\n\nStill though, I personally believe that Majora's Mask would most likely have come from Ikana Canyon being that it seems most influenced by the mask and that the inside of the arena where you fight Twinmold has pillars with the mask engraved on them. If it came from the Twilight Realm, Majora would likely look more like a twilight beast or the Twilight people would more resemble Majora.

Listing these pros or cons allows anyone, even Linux users to make the choice that makes the most sense to them so to not list the issue would be detrimental to those people which is not really fair.

Another would be an internal way to program the keys from the device itself.

First is there isn't that many games so you can't throw a game away. Even top teams don't really have that luxury since seeding might actually affect outcomes. Then comes the number of people. You need to convince a lot of people to throw a game. Maybe not the whole 53 man roster plus coaching staff but a good dozen or so players. If you under-perform you're going to be pulled. Last is pride. Players get payed very well so money wouldn't be a good incentive. Unless you get the QB (the most scrutinized player on the field) I really don't see how you can rig it.

O_o [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO2rM-l-vdQ) is a demo that is demonstrating UE 4s real-time rendering capabilities.  The biggest things that are changing this generation are PBR materials, Particle systems, real-time lighting, and real time post. \n\nPBR is a game changer. It'll make every material look much different from each other compaired to last generation. You'll be able to tell the difference between cotton and Polyester, or Kevlar just by the way light reacts. Old tech using spec and gloss really did not do this as well. It goes way more in depth than that but that's a simple way to put it. Fox Engine actually uses PBR and thats why the materials in it look so good. Fox didn't invent PBR but it was the first one to get a product out to the market. Fox's implementation is not done as well as UE4. \n\nParticle systems are a million times more robust this generation. Real time calculating particles and much more vivid particles will become the norm this generation. UE4 blows everyone away in this market.
