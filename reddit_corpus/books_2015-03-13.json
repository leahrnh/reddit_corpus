That I had at least tried, if only once, to talk to the man who had unwittingly become my Gandalf (or Obi-Wan, or Dumbledore, as you will).\n\nI never finished it.\n\nThe letter was sitting, half-finished, in my drive this morning. When I heard the news...Well, I finished it. Don't know if I'll ever send it. But I'll post it here, at least.\n\n\"Dear Mr. Pratchett -\nIn the fall of 2004, a friend of mine pushed a book into my hand and breathlessly whispered to me, \"Read this.\" When I looked down, I found that I was holding a curious hardback tome, laminated, as all library books were, with a cover showing a fist thrusting out of a pile of letters. I read the words on the cover. Going Postal, by Terry Pratchett. Some silly book about a post office? What could be more boring? Still, my friend wasn't usually wrong about my literary tastes.\n\nA few hours later, instead of paying attention in history class, I cracked open the book. *The flotillas of the dead sailed around the world on underwater rivers\u2026 *\n\nI devoured the book in six hours.\n\nFrom that rainy October day, I was a lost soul. I scoured the library for more books by this Terry Pratchett. I got a part time job, money to feed my obsession. Every week I had a spare bit of coin it was off to the local bookstore, where I methodically hunted down and seized every last Pratchett book they had, to be dragged kicking and screaming back to my lair. I bought the books not just for myself, no. This was too big for just one person. I became a missionary, spreading the gospel of Pratchett wherever I could. My books were resources, meant to hook new victims, luring them in to the glorious new world I had found. Countless other friends, at some point or another, have now had a Pratchett book shoved into their hands with a breathless, \"Read this.\" It was like nothing I had ever read before.\n\nDiscworld is special.\n\nPlenty of authors do humor. Plenty of authors can do fantasy. The intrigue, the mystery, all that is not difficult to find. But I have never encountered another author who can put the same amount of heart into his books. The only books I have ever cried at were Discworld novels. The only novels that always left me with the warm glow of contentment radiating through me after the end were Discworld (I can still quote from memory the last line of Witches Abroad: \"But they went the long way, and saw the elephant.\").\n\nDiscworld found me an angry, disaffected young man, right at that age where he knows everyone else in the world is wrong, where everything is awful, and he's oh-so-superior for being the one to notice that. Discworld shook me out of that state.\n\nDiscworld taught me to see the good in people. \"It takes all sorts to make a world.\" Even Ankh-Morpork's worst, most selfish, and vile characters had some nugget of goodness inside of them. The lazy, incompetent Fred Colon is still a wonderful human being. Who can fail to be charmed by CMOT Dibbler? And are there any who would not vote for self-professed tyrant Vetinari?\n\nThat, to me, was the charm of Discworld: the sheer, irrepressible love of humanity and the world that constantly shines through, no matter how dark the subject matter. Joy, love, and tolerance, not hatred, or cruelty, were truly the best ways to live (and of course, what better teacher of these things than Death Himself?).\nDiscworld made me who I am today.\n\nI learned that you have to believe the little lies as practice for the big ones.\n\nI learned that some things are important.\n\nI learned that sometimes, in the hands of the right person, glass become diamond.\n\nDiscworld is usually regulated to the fantasy and science fiction shelves. My English teachers turned up their nose at it. It was not \"serious literature.\" But I felt differently.

It must have been a tough decision to move forward with a mass change like this nonetheless.  What are the logistical implications?    Do you know the time frame or if it will be possible at all to change the audiobooks?  I'd think at the earliest those wouldn't be possible until the third book comes out (since Michael Kramer and Kate Reading will already be in the booth) but I'm just guessing at this point.

I think Lucas has ruined doing things like this for a lot of people, and I was certain many readers would dislike it.  (Turns out, there have been fewer voices against it than I'd assumed.)\n\nOne of the things I'll be doing is making sure Book Three works with either version of the ending.  I consider the changes minor.  The big reason I made the swap, however, was that (I hope) these books will be read for years to come, and I wanted to get the *right* ending.  \n\nIt shouldn't be TOO bad logistically.  Remember, the changes shouldn't matter too much for the story as a whole.

However, in Steelheart David says that only a couple of the hundredths of High Epics in Newcago have one. Did David change his terminology between books or is there another reason. (I would also appreciate definitions for what differentiates a minor from a lesser Epic.)\n2.\tWhile Epics already age slower can their powers protect them from aging completely, be it by simply negating it or for example returning them to a specific age, upon resurrection.\n3.\tWhat exactly is needed to make a motivator? [In Firefight they operated on Obliteration to build the bomb, yet people still trade with any amount of Epic cells. Does the amount simply relate to power or is there something else?](/s)\n4.\tWhy doesn't Nighwielder's weakness penetrate his blanket over Newcago when it does pierce the shadow tendrils he attacks David with? [Could the reason be that his clouds act as some kind of \u201csecurity blanket\u201d if for example he got his weakness from being stranded in the dessert clouds like his would have protected him from the sun, which keeps the UV-rays of the sun from triggering his weakness, because they can\u2019t recreate the situation it originates from.](/s)\n", "aSentId": 11752, "answer": "1. Prime invincibility is the cream of the crop of High Epic, in David's estimation.  The hardest of the hard to kill.  However, other people define things differently.  \"High epic\" means \"I have a power that, if you stand there and try to shoot me, it doesn't work.\"  That's why in his definition, Regalia doesn't fit the bill--though many others would say her power of keeping herself hidden as she does would totally count.

I've been dodgy about answering this one, as I thought I might get into it in Book Three, but as I work on it I don't know that I am.  The answer is actually pretty simple--it's for the same reason that someone manifesting Regalia's weakness in Babilar doesn't make the waters suddenly retreat.  Or that Steelheart's powers didn't leave pockets of open material around anybody who hadn't ever heard of him.  (Which is where this exception started in my mind, as without it, the first book would never have worked.)\n\nBasically, I had to make the rule that a large scale, general use of the powers had a kind of immunity to the weakness--one of diffusion.  But the general spreading of the powers on the large scale were also far less precise.  (For example, Nightwielder could cloud the sky with darkness, but not stop rain from falling.)  \n\nOtherwise, you could just find the pockets where the Epic's powers on the grand scale were not working, and easily figure out their weakness.

The problems with Elantris created continuity issues; the problem with Mistborn is more of an artistic choice, making it similar to the problem in WoR.

We tend to like characters for a variety of different reasons.  Sometimes, we like characters because they're like us--but other characters (like Superman and James Bond) we like because we admire things they can do or who they are.  \n\nMary Sue has become a bad term in storytelling circles, but I think we're too hard on it--and in dismissing it, we dismiss a huge part of what makes us human beings. It is natural to like reading about Kvothe because, like James Bond, he is just naturally good at a lot of things--and that, in its heart, is just cool.  It's like enjoying the character of Indiana Jones.  Character arc?  None.  Mary Sue?  Yeah, probably.  Still very fun.\n\nAt the same time, it's very natural to DISLIKE that kind of character, and the difference between Indy and Kvothe is that the narrative keeps bringing Indy down (making him seem like the underdog) so we maintain rooting interest.  Kvothe, on the ohter hand, is telling his own story--and is arrogant about it.  There's nothing wrong with disliking this narrative style.  \n\nIn Kvothe's specific case, I enjoy reading about him because he's so self-destructive.  Every time he takes a step forward, he seems to take another back by ruining it with his own arrogance or stupidity.  He's one of the few characters I enjoy reading about, while disliking as a person immensely.

Speaking to modernity..Does this imply that I don'r care about upper class female problems?  or any women's problems for that matter?  No.  But i do think that the problems women in the ghetto, or women trying to rise up in the work place, or women faced with abortion troubles are more troublesome.  I mean Emma was the inspiration for Clueless, a movie about a rich girl who realizes she likes the other, atypical guy.  Her books were about social expectations of women in an upper echelon of society, about breaking those barriers and doing what you're willed to do, not whats expected, reflecting on yourself and your motives for your actions.  In a broad sense this is a good sentiment; we should all be encouraged to look inside ourselves and seek any ugly truths.

She was very vocal for a long time about not wanting to publish other Mockingbird related stories, and had made a choice to stay out of the public eye.  There have been what seem to be 'odd' things going on for the past few years- a suit against her son in law, and a suit against a local museum, that seemed to be a bit off-kilter compared to her statements surrounding her 'legacy' 10 or 20 years ago. \n\n\n\nI have no idea what she actually would like to have done with her estate.  Since she apparently had the manuscript for Go Set a Watchman available for many years, I'd guess that she herself might have released it many years/decades ago, before questions arose surrounding her health/competence. Surely if she'd wanted it released, at some point in the last 40 or 50 years she could have arranged for it to be published.  Her public persona and 'fame' (which she chose to ignore) surrounded To Kill a Mockingbird- I doubt if she forgot that she'd written a prequel.  She could have written her own ticket at any time by even mentioning that she'd written a companion work. If she'd wanted it published, surely it would have been an issue long before now.\n\nWe've got a lot of Alzheimer's in our family, and it never ceases to amaze me that very few questions are often asked to establish 'competence'.  My grandfather could tell you the day and time and what had to be done on the farm on any given day, but he also thought that aliens had transformed themselves into corn stalks (so don't harvest them), and that having firewood for the wood stove was a priority, so let's chop up all of the furniture.  My mom was the most practical person around, until the combination of Alzheimer's/melanoma that had spread to brain tumours led her to believe that there were leprechauns everywhere- if it comes down to questions of 'competence', hopefully there will be some long interviews on various days, which doesn't seem to be the case in Harper Lee's case.  \n\nI think that there should be a higher burden of proof in cases where someone decides to go against a person's stated wishes, and life.  If she wanted to have the prequel published, she could have arranged it decades ago.

Certain lines, scenes, and ideas really stuck with me as I grew up and it influenced the way I lived. The series also impacted my writing style, as I love to communicate with the audience from time to time. Though I don't think I realized it right away I certainly could tell after reading the series a second time.\nThere is one book I'm reading now, A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole, that I can tell is affecting me. As soon as I had gotten through the first chapter it stirred something inside me and I know the characters will stay with me for a long time.", "aSentId": 13759, "answer": "Confederacy is my favorite novel.

Every writer hopes that his or her work will have an impact on others as much as it may have had for the author during the course of writing it.\n\nI've had a number of profound experiences in reading books over the years.  Some of these involve books with a gripping story that completely enveloped my imagination and life for a period of time.  In my youth, such books were any by Edgar Rice Burroughs, but in particular, the Barsoom series, with its engaging character, the noble John Carter.  I also loved the Tarzan books.  C.S. Lewis's Narnia series also completely bewitched me as a teenager.  Later, I was more attracted to books like Shunryu Suzuki's Zen Mind, Beginner's mind, which transformed my formerly sad life during my first years in college.  It gave me a new sense of power and authority in choosing and making my own path in life.\n\nSince then there have been other great books, Iron John, By Robert Bly, Wind, Sand and Stars by Antoine de Saint-Exupery, and I've quite enjoyed (and probably read more times repeatedly than many other books) the King Killer Chronicle series of Patrick Rothfuss.\n\nBut, as a writer, I'd like to add (hopefully without sounding too mercenary) that the greatest experience with a book has been writing my own.  I've recently published my book of poetry on Amazon after about twenty years of tweaking it and adding and subtracting, and contemplation, and feedback, and edits and re-edits and so on, and so on.  It's been a lengthy labor, but in the end, an incredibly rewarding one.  It has changed my life in many wonderful ways, brought new people into my life, given me the chance to find a receptive audience for my work, been something I can point at and say \"I did this!\"  It's a great sense of accomplishment because, one, it was a tremendous amount of work and I persisted and completed it, and, two, I enjoyed it and still enjoy reading it myself, and, three, I get lots of lovely loving comments and feedback from those who've given of their precious time to actually read it.  There are actually people in the world who have shared their time and read my book!  It's really quite a miracle, for which I'm very thankful indeed.\n\nSo, for me, it has been the writing of a book that has made my life a very different experience than it was previously.", "aSentId": 13768, "answer": "I'm sorry but /r/books doesn't allow promotional posts.
