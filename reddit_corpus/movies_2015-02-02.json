Sadly there are some circles where that's the opposite. Black was so miscast. It's a huge steaming dump compaired to the original (1933) - played by Robert Armstrong.\n\n\nArmstrong role was an explorer and filmmaker. He came to Skull Island to record an action and nature flick. When Darrow is kidnapped, Denham dropped everything to rescue her. His responsibility - she trusted him. While true, the man is somewhat of an opportunist, he has honor. He doesn't pass culpability; early on he talks about filming with savage wild animals; he's right there with the camera man in the danger's path. He'll die too, but it'll be on camera.\n\n\nOnce back in New York; Denham kept his word about sharing the wealth, the Kong show on Broadway. I can imagine Black's Denham pocketed much of the profits with some of the money going to the survivors.\n\n\nIn the sequel, \"Son Of Kong\" (1933; set one month later), Denham (reprised by Armstrong) is broke having lost all his fortune and reputation to the giant ape run amok scandal. Add to the mess, he's being sued by everyone; deaths and destruction. Plus there's a Grand Jury indictment for him, prison. He discovers that Skull Island may hold immeasurable riches. He returns to the dreaded place to right his wrongs. He wants to find that treasure to pay off his creditors and free his conscience - to do the right thing.\n\n\nJack Black's Carl Denham is none of these things. He's a jackass, liar and a scoundrel. I hated this portrayal. They turned an honorable man into a coward. Other than that, I enjoyed the movie.\n\n\nThere is another one, but minor.\n\n\nThe captain of the Venture, Englehorn; played originally by Frank Reicher. The first captain was this old, salty man who probably saw a lot of action in his better days. In \"Kong\" we see him take charge of his crew when Ann is abducted. The man may be geriatric, but he still has a lot of life in him. The new captain played by Thomas Kretschmann, a much younger man, still salty though. I have nothing bad to say about this characterization. But how cool would it have been to have an elderly man, kicking ass and taking names? Giant bugs? Screw you!!!","aSentId": 559,"answer": "I agree. I think Jack Black can be really funny (can be) but I, too, think he was miscast in this movie. Or if not miscast, than the characterization of Carl Denham was all wrong.\n\nThe original Denham was based on the two men who played the largest part in bringing King Kong into fruition. Ernest Schoedsack and Edgar Wallace were two adventurous men, both served during war times, and eventually went on to film in exotic locations that most people never dared travel. To see Denham reduced to a manipulative rascal was disappointing.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3s","qSentId": 561,"question": "Eh... who didn't know this?\n\nI am not being rude but what?

They use it to sell EVERYTHING but when it comes down to it the men are censored (though shirtless men are used to reel women into PG-13 movies while a shirtless woman is an R, so it goes both ways depending on what audience the movie is going for) and the people going to see the movie (like all of the women who went to see Magic Mike and now 50 Shades) are getting shafted while the guys they drag along end up getting the most out of it (More nude women than men in Magic Mike, and surely Dakota Johnson will be showing practically everything in 50 Shades). \n\nEven network shows use sex to market themselves but there is nothing because it's network tv, and if there was something special interest groups and advertisers would have a fit. Yet they buy into it to begin with because of sensual implications in the marketing.\n\nThen at the same time shows like Game of Thrones are massively popular. Everything is so contradictory. Make up your minds people, sex is either open or not. The US is so weird in that we're so repressed yet it's all around us at the same time. So much cognitive dissonance. I hope we're more like Europe one day.\n\nI don't have any interest in graphic nudity in movies because if I'm watching something with a lot of nudity I'm watching it alone or with a girlfriend and I don't have a girlfriend. I don't think my lone preference to not see sex and nudity in the movies I choose to see in theaters should dictate things though, and plenty of people, despite the fact they should know better by now, go to a lot of movies expecting to see certain things and walk out disappointed.

Like I said above, most internet porn videos have downright awful stories. Fully budgeted films on the other hand are story oriented and depict characters that the viewer actually cares about. It can be very satisfying to see these characters fulfill their sexual desires, and can be very erotic for teens going through puberty. Many movies have the classic, every-man protagonist; which allows the viewer to easily project themselves to that protagonist and his/ her sexual experiences. It is stimulating for the immersed viewer to imagine themselves in the protagonist's sexy situation. \n\nBack to my main point. I am not saying that movies do a better job at sex than porn, **I never said that!** Movies often have sex scenes which are sexually stimulating to many people. In a movie which has 1/5 of its running time devoted to high production value sex scenes, is it that hard to predict that at least a couple of people might just masturbate to it?

Or a bear. Or an elephant. \"Dinosaur\" is about the same as \"animal\". Sure, you might have a v. mongoliensis pet, but that doesn't mean you don't want to see deinonychus antirrhopus at the zoo. Although it's not really a zoo, it's a theme park.\n\nAnd it's not like pet dinosaurs would allow people to steal the concept. They'd still need to have the technology. Otherwise anyone could actually do what InGen did. Without InGen's technology they couldn't do that. While you'd still get animals in the local ecosystem, InGen would probably make it so that all the dinosaurs are sterile, in much the same way Monsanto makes corn sterile. No license for breeding, no breedable dinos. If this *is* a continuation/sequel, then they'd probably fix that whole \"changing sex\" thing.\n\nI mean, shit, it'd probably be more lucrative than the park in the first place. Especially since no one is going to feed their v. mongoliensis steak. You'd have an entire new division of Masrani Global dedicated to making dino chow. Sure, you'd have other companies providing knock offs of the formula for the food, but they'd have gotten in on the ground floor with breeding, selling, housing, training, and creating toys for an entirely new designer pet.

The studio forces facilities to release un-finished work, often forcing artists to work intense overtime to achieve something they know is sub-par and that will likely need to be re-done.  \n\nThe studios will often also add trailer-specific changes, lengths, etc. and possibly work that won't even be in the film.  They might actually pay ILM for this but usually these kinds of ridiculous requests are expected to be done without any additional pay even if they make these changes weeks or even days before the work is due.  Some studios are habitually wretched with this sort of thing.  \n\nIn general, I noticed an overall decrease in contrast, in some places, increasing fill light either through the overall grade (you can see differences in not just the creatures but on the actors, etc.) or playing up indirect illumination.  The original teaser looked like they dug up the old Renderman shaders from the first film but the trailer feels more physically based.  The only thing I don't like is the use of subsurface, which is inappropriate for reptilian skin, as well as too much jiggle, which is also not physically based (Godzilla, similarly, had waaaaay too much expression and deformation happening in areas of plated skin that would be rigidly bound to skeletal structure).

While the movie clocks in at a 188 minute feature, it keeps your interest and it keeps you thinking. A high caliber of performances all around.\n\n**[Boogie Nights](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118749/)**: I love this movie. Holy cow. The core of the cast from Magnolia plays a completely different role in Boogie Nights. Mark Wahlberg is fantastic in this and so is just about everybody else. Paul Thomas Anderson officially enters in my list of top directors. This movie is equal parts drama, comedy, and is all around entertaining. One of my top movies.\n\n* *Day 18*\n\n**[The Skeleton Twins](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1571249/)**: Being really close to my siblings, this movie spoke to me. I really enjoyed this movie. It has humor, drama, emotions, acting, and a great story. It sucks you in and makes you feel the emotions of the characters. Again, this is one of my top movies. \n\n* *Day 19*\n\n**[Gone Girl](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2267998/)**: This movie gripped me from the beginning and held on through all the twists, turns, and changes. It kept me surprised and guessing. I'm a big fan of David Finchers' work, and this movie is another title on his shelf of fantastic pieces of work.\n\n**[Coherence](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2866360/)**: It's been a while since I have seen [Primer](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390384/) (which is 10 years old already?) but these two movies definitely compare. The story keeps you guessing and after viewing this, I looked up some discussions over this movie on Reddit. Now I'm already planning to see it again. I really liked this movie and I recommend it for fans of Primer.\n\n* *Day 20*\n\n**[Whiplash](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2582802/)**: I was in band and marching band in high school, on top of doing a little jazz in middle school. I loved the music in this. I never had a teacher *quite* like Fletcher, but I appreciated this film from a personal experience point of view. The continuing starting and stopping during rehearsal was all too familiar, and nonstop practice is sometimes the only answer to a problem. I thought the ending was dragged out just a *little* too long but I loved the note and feeling that the movie ended on. If nothing else, I recommend it for the creative string of curses you hear from the mouth of J.K. Simmons. Miles Teller also shines in this movie. Plus another [notes(#/ \"I saw this again a day after my challenge ended and loved it even more. Magnificent movie.\").\n\n* *Day 21* + [note](#s \"I'm definitely starting to burn out. Between work and classes, I wish I had thought of this earlier in break. But like I said before, I'm committed.\")\n\n**[Open Grave](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2071550/)**: I really liked this. This was a very interesting take on an often overplayed genre. The story develops at a good pace and the movie ends before it feels too long. Recommended for suspense and story. \n\n**[Secretary](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0274812/)**: This was a bit of a quiet, slower movie compared to what I've seen for the last few days. I still enjoyed it, but it isn't quite as sexual as people think. Unless I'm desensitized. I liked this, particularly the performances by James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal. \n\n* *Day 22*\n\n**[Sunshine](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0448134/)**: I liked this up until ~~[a certain point](#s \"When they find Pinbacker. The camera work bugged me too much.\")~~. Overall, a really good movie. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it. It had potential to be one of the my top science fiction films but ultimately ends up falling short.\n\n* *Day 23*\n\n**[Tiny Furniture](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1570989/)**: This was alright. A bit existentialist. I'm graduating soon so I'm starting to understand the point of view of Aura. But overall, this wasn't *the* most boring movie I've seen so far but it is close.\n\n**[Paths of Glory](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050825/)**: Anyone who says a movie about World War I is hard to make needs to see this movie. It has action, it has drama, and it has emotions. I wish we had more movies about WWI. Just one of many good movies directed by Stanley Kubrick.\n\n* *Day 24*\n\n**[The Interview](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2788710/)**: I actually really liked this. It was funny and more creative than I thought it would be. Some people might not enjoy Seth Rogan and James Franco but I'm a fan of their humor. Sure, it can be mindless at times, but it reminds me of when I'm hanging out with friends. Not every sentence is scientific or deep, but it sure is fun. It has also been a few days since I've seen an outright comedy. Overall, I really enjoyed this. Best part? Saw it on Netflix. ^^And ^^I'm ^^not ^^totally ^^convinced ^^that ^^the ^^hacking ^^*scandal* ^^wasn't ^^some ^^kind ^^of ^^publicity ^^stunt.\n\n* *Day 25*\n\n**[The To Do List](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1758795/)**: I really liked this film and I think its 5.6 on IMDb is a bit harsh. This is a comedic All Star cast. If you wanted to put together a story based around real life situations, and you wanted it to be funny, this is a really good group to go with. And the soundtrack was enjoyable, particularly because it fits the time period of the movie. Sure, the last scenes or so were a little bit corny, but overall I enjoyed this movie. \n\n* *Day 26*\n\n**[Dog Day Afternoon](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072890/)**: This was a good movie with Al Pacino. I liked it well enough. I'd recommend it for fans of bank robbery movies (I still think the best bank robbery movie is **[Inside Man](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0454848/)**).\n\n**[Side by Side](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2014338/)**: This documentary covers the film versus digital debate that currently exists in Hollywood. I learned a bit from this, particularly about the process of creating films. I also learned about some of the roles of the people who manipulate the image. There's a lot of great-looking movies represented here. George Lucas and David Fincher were really the only names that I knew going in, but I understood the comparing and the contrasts better and better as they showed a dozen or so examples from just as many movies. This documentary is a must-see for anyone who cares about film.\n\n* *Day 27*\n\n**[Smokin' Aces](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0475394/)**: Loved this cast. This movie was crazy, busy, funny, creative, bloody, and confusing all at one time. This was pretty entertaining. The ending was definitely not something I could have guessed, either. I liked the parallel stories, even if they did get a little convoluted. Seeing all of the groups pitted against each other, only to reach the climax the way the it was reached, was really fun to watch. \n\n* *Day 28* + [note](#s \"If I wasn't so close to the end, I might take a break. I've got classes and a test on day 29, all while work is ramping up. But I'm dedicated to the cause, so hopefully you guys appreciate my consistency.\")\n\n**[Trainspotting](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117951/)**: Well I really enjoyed this. Fantastic story that kept me engaged. The soundtrack cannot go by unmentioned. Even though I've never been addicted to drugs, or stolen to afford to live, or any sort of thing like that, I still connected with this film. It's brutal, it's ugly, and it's truthful. Great acting and a great script make this film come alive. \n\n* *Day 29*\n\n**[Dogtooth](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1379182/)**: I don't know what I just watched. This is my only exposure to anything Greek and...I think I'm intrigued? Of course, I had to look up interpretations on the Internet, and the most common [~~theme~~](#s \"The parents play the role of the government, protecting the kids from the outside world. The kids only trust the parents, because they have no other choice. Any small, insignificant event, like an overhead plane or a kitten, can be used to manipulate the children. This matches up with government vs citizens in a way, I think.\") is something I think I agree with. The cinematography was great as well, and I'm pretty sure there's something to be said about the color palette, but I need to see it again to be sure. The movie is ridiculous, and possibly one of the darkest in terms comedy. But this isn't a comedy. This is something entirely on its own. And it definitely isn't for everybody. The one question that I have, hours (and days) after I've seen it, is \"What did I just watch?\"\n\n* *Day 30*\n\n**[Tusk](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3099498/)**: This movie was a little ridiculous. I liked it, but it definitely had it's moments of weirdness. The story development was pretty well done and I recommend this for all lovers of mind-twisting movies.\n\n**[R100](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2914838/)**: What? What did I just watch? This was definitely one of the weirder movies I've seen. I can't even BS my way into an explanation. I didn't hate this movie or anything but frankly, I just didn't expect this. I don't \"get\" it.

Recommended for suspense and story. \n\n**[Secretary](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0274812/)**: This was a bit of a quiet, slower movie compared to what I've seen for the last few days.

I liked this, particularly the performances by James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal. \n\n* *Day 22*\n\n**[Sunshine](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0448134/)**: I liked this up until ~~[a certain point](#s \"When they find Pinbacker.

It had potential to be one of the my top science fiction films but ultimately ends up falling short.\n\n* *Day 23*\n\n**[Tiny Furniture](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1570989/)**: This was alright.

Just one of many good movies directed by Stanley Kubrick.\n\n* *Day 24*\n\n**[The Interview](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2788710/)**: I actually really liked this. It was funny and more creative than I thought it would be. Some people might not enjoy Seth Rogan and James Franco but I'm a fan of their humor. Sure, it can be mindless at times, but it reminds me of when I'm hanging out with friends. Not every sentence is scientific or deep, but it sure is fun.

This is a comedic All Star cast. If you wanted to put together a story based around real life situations, and you wanted it to be funny, this is a really good group to go with. And the soundtrack was enjoyable, particularly because it fits the time period of the movie.

There's a lot of great-looking movies represented here. George Lucas and David Fincher were really the only names that I knew going in, but I understood the comparing and the contrasts better and better as they showed a dozen or so examples from just as many movies. This documentary is a must-see for anyone who cares about film.\n\n* *Day 27*\n\n**[Smokin' Aces](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0475394/)**: Loved this cast. This movie was crazy, busy, funny, creative, bloody, and confusing all at one time. This was pretty entertaining. The ending was definitely not something I could have guessed, either. I liked the parallel stories, even if they did get a little convoluted. Seeing all of the groups pitted against each other, only to reach the climax the way the it was reached, was really fun to watch. \n\n* *Day 28* + [note](#s \"If I wasn't so close to the end, I might take a break.

Even though I've never been addicted to drugs, or stolen to afford to live, or any sort of thing like that, I still connected with this film. It's brutal, it's ugly, and it's truthful.

The cinematography was great as well, and I'm pretty sure there's something to be said about the color palette, but I need to see it again to be sure. The movie is ridiculous, and possibly one of the darkest in terms comedy. But this isn't a comedy. This is something entirely on its own. And it definitely isn't for everybody.

But I did want to go out of this challenge with a bang and I think I got that.","aSentId": 7563,"answer": "#**My Personal Top 5**\n\n1. **[Whiplash](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2582802/)**\n2. **[Short Term 12](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2370248/)**\n3. **[Boogie Nights](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118749/)**\n4. **[Gone Girl](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2267998/)**\n5. **[Good Morning, Vietnam](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093105/)**\n\nHonorable Mention: **[Nowhere Boy](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1266029/)**\n\nI have so many reservations about this list. This list feels a little too weighted towards comedy, considering all the genres and subgenres I experienced. I almost want to make a Top 10 list. My reservations stem from the fact that so many of the movies I saw were incredible in one way or another. I can re-sort this list any which way and I'll never be truly satisfied about it. So don't persecute me for this. Ultimately, if I had to pick just *five* movies for anyone to see, I think this list would be pretty close to what I would recommend. I could easily toss in **[The Babadook](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2321549/)**, or **[Nightcrawler](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2872718/)**, or **[Trainspotting](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117951/)** (and to a lesser extent, **[The Skeleton Twins](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1571249/)** or **[Open Grave](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2071550/)**) and still consider it an all around good list. Of course, everything is subjective.\n\n---\n\nClosing notes because I've already written this much. Watching a new movie a day really is a bit of a challenge. I probably didn't help myself by watching 2 movies a day sometimes. It's honestly a bit draining and mind numbing. And I kept finding myself craving comedy. Comedy is by far my favorite genre. That's why movies like *Boogie Nights*, *Good Morning, Vietnam*, and *The Skeleton Twins* take up such a large portion of my top movies. \n\n[Here](http://i.imgur.com/8bERTX7.png) is some data on the time commitment devoted to this challenge. The average movie was 109 minutes long, or 1.8 hours, and I viewed an average 1.4 movies each day. The graph shows the number of minutes (y-axis) for each movie (x-axis). \n\nI didn't finish the list I began with. After getting the opinions of /r/movies, I had an even longer list. I added movies throughout the challenge. But I still have many more stories I want to see from my old list. I'm definitely going to take a week or two from any hardcore movie viewing. And I do wish I had seen more classics and older movies. Towards the end, I began thinking that I was lacking some variation. This led to the last four movies on my list. There are some movies (namely *Am\u00e9lie*, *He Loves Me... He Loves Me Not*, *Life is Beautiful*, *Panic in Year Zero!*, and *The Seventh Seal*) that I was particularly excited to see, but it just never felt like the right moment. I'll probably end up seeing most of these before I start my next challenge.\n\nI already know what my next challenge will be. And I'll ask /r/movies for their opinions, because I'm excited about this one.

While the movie clocks in at a 188 minute feature, it keeps your interest and it keeps you thinking. A high caliber of performances all around.\n\n**[Boogie Nights](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118749/)**: I love this movie. Holy cow. The core of the cast from Magnolia plays a completely different role in Boogie Nights. Mark Wahlberg is fantastic in this and so is just about everybody else. Paul Thomas Anderson officially enters in my list of top directors. This movie is equal parts drama, comedy, and is all around entertaining. One of my top movies.\n\n* *Day 18*\n\n**[The Skeleton Twins](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1571249/)**: Being really close to my siblings, this movie spoke to me. I really enjoyed this movie. It has humor, drama, emotions, acting, and a great story. It sucks you in and makes you feel the emotions of the characters. Again, this is one of my top movies. \n\n* *Day 19*\n\n**[Gone Girl](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2267998/)**: This movie gripped me from the beginning and held on through all the twists, turns, and changes. It kept me surprised and guessing. I'm a big fan of David Finchers' work, and this movie is another title on his shelf of fantastic pieces of work.\n\n**[Coherence](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2866360/)**: It's been a while since I have seen [Primer](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390384/) (which is 10 years old already?) but these two movies definitely compare. The story keeps you guessing and after viewing this, I looked up some discussions over this movie on Reddit. Now I'm already planning to see it again. I really liked this movie and I recommend it for fans of Primer.\n\n* *Day 20*\n\n**[Whiplash](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2582802/)**: I was in band and marching band in high school, on top of doing a little jazz in middle school. I loved the music in this. I never had a teacher *quite* like Fletcher, but I appreciated this film from a personal experience point of view. The continuing starting and stopping during rehearsal was all too familiar, and nonstop practice is sometimes the only answer to a problem. I thought the ending was dragged out just a *little* too long but I loved the note and feeling that the movie ended on. If nothing else, I recommend it for the creative string of curses you hear from the mouth of J.K. Simmons. Miles Teller also shines in this movie. Plus another [notes(#/ \"I saw this again a day after my challenge ended and loved it even more. Magnificent movie.\").\n\n* *Day 21* + [note](#s \"I'm definitely starting to burn out.

He's shorter than I thought he would be.  Long, thin, somewhat wavy/curly hair.  His friends call him \"Larry.\"  He often wears t-shirts advertising various brands; he has one red one with the Tabasco hot sauce label on it.  I think I heard something about him being in a band, but I've never been to any of his shows.  Sharon in accounting said he was pretty good.  I wanna say he plays bass.\n\nSharon's been going through a rough time, though.  After the divorce, her kids have been really distant.  Her oldest is 22, her daughter.  She basically stopped talking to the whole family when it went down.  Last Sharon heard she's out in L.A. trying to make it as a make-up artist in the movies, but she never really thought the girl was any good at her own make-up, let alone doing others'.  Too much eye shadow, she says.  And lots of loud colors.  Make up should be natural, you know?  Something you might not notice if you weren't looking at it up close.\n\nHer son, though, is 15, and he's pretty much been a terror ever since the split.  Boy, does he act out.  Sharon has had to take time off quite a few times to meet with the boy's school principal, or to bring him to his therapy sessions.  They've got him on pills for depression, which seem to do something for a while, but then he stops taking them, and he becomes a mess.  Last year he up and stole Sharon's car and drove it around town for a couple hours in the middle of the night.  She doesn't know what to do with him, the poor thing.\n\nBut anyways, before I got off the subject, the point was that things are looking up for both of them lately.  Sharon and Larry have been seeing each other, from what I understand, and it seems to be going well.  She's been going to see his band, and they've been having some really great talks.  The only weird part is that Larry keeps trying to talk her into doing a nude photo shoot, and Sharon's really creeped out by the whole thing.  He also has a strange pet name for her; she says he keeps calling her \"Milf.\"  I don't even *begin* to pretend to know what that's supposed to mean.\n\nAnyways, I gotta go.  You always get me talking like this.  I'll see you at the soccer game Tuesday night.  I'll bring that birthday card you wanted to sign that I passed around the office.\n\nTake care.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3s","qSentId": 9034,"question": "You really need a /s on that comment.

But much like voters, your average union member doesn't really understand how risky (not to mention unfair to the next generation) it is to rely on funding a generation down the road. Private corporations are usually better about future expenses and profitability, but not always, as you are clearly aware of. Bosses and union officials were both crooks in this instance. And the idea that union officials didn't know what they were doing is laughable - even outside observers understood, so unless the union leadership was hilariously incompetent or lying to themselves, so did they.\n\nAs for public sector unions, there is no clear accountability for politicians and union leaders agreeing to vastly unrealistic pension schemes that won't be funded until a generation later. This is the exact sort of reason that even FDR, champion of social welfare and the new deal, thought that implementing public sector unions in the style of private sector unions was a horrible idea. Unlike businesses, which at least theoretically have two independent sides, owners/management and workers, politicians are voted into office by citizens. They aren't responsible to any sort of fiscal check that would keep them from agreeing to impossible deals so long as the public isn't being held accountable in the short to medium term.\n\nAnd while white flight (or really, anyone with fiscal sense leaving Detroit) is partially responsible, there's nothing stopping a well run city from shrinking. Sure, the budget will be reduced, but the services needed will also be reduced, so it should just be a matter of going through a downsizing process. No fun for anyone involved, but not unheard of or unmanageable.

It's clear from your reply that (no offense) either you misunderstood me, or I failed to convey my thoughts clearly.  I'll try to explain better.\n\nWhat I was saying wasn't that, post facto, the author should not be paid for the work that she expected to be paid for.  In fact, if you look through my past comments you'll see I'm very strongly on her side.  To the point that I personally will be boycotting future films by this director.\n\nWhat I was suggesting was that, since so many authors have trouble enforcing copyright and getting paid for their writing, it might just be better for them to stop doing it.  Stop writing for a living.  Do something else.  I was proposing that, as a society, we could eliminate copyright as a legal right, and with it, the notion of writing copyrightable IP as an occupation.\n\nSo in that world, nobody would be a professional writer or musician, and most likely nobody would make movies because there wouldn't be any way to enforce copyright on the end product.  Nobody would have any incentive to make movies or TV shows, so those would disappear, but writing wouldn't completely, because some people still do it just as a hobby (for example, there are a few subreddits I like that specialize in free, for-fun writing).  Music also wouldn't entirely disappear because lots of people make music for fun.\n\n&gt; You may not like Profit, you may be uncomfortable with the idea of Profit\n\nWhoooooa, there.  Now, I never said any of that.  I like profit just fine, and I've made quite a bit of it myself on the stock market.\n\nBut making a profit on *copyright* is getting harder and harder.  And while most profit motives drive productive behavior, I'm not convinced that art as a product is something so essential for its consumers that we need a profit motive and an economic system to push its production.  I feel like art often does more emotionally for the producer than the consumer, so commoditizing it and expecting it to be pulled from the consumer side might not be the right way of handling it.\n\n&gt; but that is how responsible people LIVE.\n\nResponsible people can live all sorts of different ways.  There are plenty of responsible people living in societies that use something other than a market economy.  In some places, people live based on mutual friendship, loyalty, and an emotional sense of reciprocity rather than legal contracts and accounting and a monetary profit motive.  I'm not saying that's what I would prefer -- obviously not since that's not the society I've chosen to live in -- but I wouldn't call them \"irresponsible\" just because they're different from us.

At least not today.\n\nPirating is making an illegal copy of material someone else has copyright to, right? \n\nJust trying to define what constitutes \"an illegal copy\" is in many cases rather tricky. \"Fair use\" is one such example were the rules gets fuzzy. Then we get into the total, utter mess that is copyright laws, and to be honest IP laws in general. What is copyright and who gets it? Since nothing we do is created in a vacuum everything new takes its inspiration or borrows from someone/somewhere. Or, sometimes they just steal it more or less wholesale. \n\nA few videos to give you some idea of how tricky it can get (from sources better than me): \n\n* Everything is a remix - http://everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series/\n* Amen break - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SaFTm2bcac\n* Top 10 Rip-off Songs - http://www.watchmojo.com/video/id/12422/\n\nSee where I'm going? With all these movies, songs, books and what not floating around it gets pretty hard after a while to figure out who did what first. \n\nBut even after all that, I think many are missing the most important question. Why do we have copyright laws, and other IP laws such as patents? What is the point?\n\nI would argue that the core reason is **not** to ensure that artists and creators get payed. I would instead argue that we have them because our society benefits from having them, that we get more and better works of art with good copyright and IP laws than without them. That we progress faster with than without them. \n\nBut do we really benefit from todays [patent trolls?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_troll) No, we don't. \n\nSomething needs to be done about the copyright and IP laws. At the moment, specially with our digital society, they are very, very broken and really, really needs to be fixed!\n\n","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3s","qSentId": 10988,"question": "http://38.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lwywl160wi1qb03ezo1_500.png","aSentId": 10989,"answer": "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/45/StealThisAlbum.png","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3s","qSentId": 10990,"question": "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/45/StealThisAlbum.png","aSentId": 10991,"answer": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G1BRBX4SL.jpg","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3s","qSentId": 10992,"question": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51G1BRBX4SL.jpg","aSentId": 10993,"answer": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ2Fh3tAD-I&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3s","qSentId": 10994,"question": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ2Fh3tAD-I&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player","aSentId": 10995,"answer": "http://shopnycdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/c550x470.jpg","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3s","qSentId": 10990,"question": "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/45/StealThisAlbum.png","aSentId": 10997,"answer": "WHAT A SPLENDID PIE\n\nPIZZA PIZZA PIE\n\nEVERY MINUTE EVERY SECOND\n\nBUY BUY BUY BUY BUY","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3s","qSentId": 10998,"question": "WHAT A SPLENDID PIE\n\nPIZZA PIZZA PIE\n\nEVERY MINUTE EVERY SECOND\n\nBUY BUY BUY BUY BUY","aSentId": 10999,"answer": "Pepperoni and green peppers, mushrooms, olives, chives!","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3s","qSentId": 11000,"question": "Pepperoni and green peppers, mushrooms, olives, chives!","aSentId": 11001,"answer": "**Need** therapy, therapy, ^advertisement^causes\n\n**Need** therapy, therapy, ^advertisement^causes","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3s","qSentId": 10998,"question": "WHAT A SPLENDID PIE\n\nPIZZA PIZZA PIE\n\nEVERY MINUTE EVERY SECOND\n\nBUY BUY BUY BUY BUY","aSentId": 11003,"answer": "pepperrroni and green peppers mushrooms olives chives","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3s","qSentId": 11005,"question": "Read the article.

My original post was on how if the corporate veil was pierced, the liabilities transfer as well. You defend the judge's ruling that WB did not pierce NL's corporate veil. Fine. On that point, we're honkey dory.\n\nI do not believe that the author truely believed what she said about \"Gravity the movie\" having absolutely nothing to do with her book. I do not know why she said those things in public. She seems to be pursuing a different argument in this court case. As I am not intimately involved with the brass tacks of her case, I cannot speculate why she has pursued her current course of action.\n\nI believe movie GRAVITY developed by WB would not have resulted had the author not written the book, contracted it to NL, and had it preliminary developed by NL.  I believe NL would object to WB's development of the movie if WB was not the owner of NL's shares. \n\nPerhaps because the connection seems obvious in this specific case, but cannot be legally connected in court, do I feel that the author has been screwed by WB and disenfranchsied by the legal system. \n\nPlease excuse my moral and ethical, if not legal, outrage. It results from WB's succseeful legal argument that they did not pierce corporate veil, and so shaft author, while leave her defenseless due to WB's relationship with NL (pierced or otherwise). Because I feel NL has no vested interest in taking up a copyright claim against WB, I feel both NL + WB have done a major disservice to the author.

The argument isn't that there is no contract, it is that the contract was with New Line, not WB. The first part of the contract, her getting paid for the film rights, was already fulfilled when she sold it. The second part of the contract, getting paid a portion of the proceeds from the film New Line would have made, does not apply because New Line never made the film. It's no different than if New Line had sat on the IP forever. She'd never get paid for the other part of the contract because it was never exercised.\n\nHer argument is that WB was acting on New Line's behalf when it acquired New Line and made the movie themselves. Therefore they need to fulfill the other end of the deal. WB's argument is that they are not liable for the deals made by their subsidiary. The rights were transferred to them, but they did not inherit there contractual obligations originally associated with it.\n\nNot knowing enough about this kind of law, it seems to me it could go either way depending on the exact wording of the contract as well as how the movies rights were exchanged between New Line and WB.\n\nThink of it this way: Say I have a hot dog stand that I want to sell to someone who is going to use it commercially. I say I will sell the equipment to a guy for $500 up front, but I also want 10% of his sales. He buys the equipment, but then decides he is not going to get into this business and instead sells/gives it away to his friend. Now the friend is making hot dogs and selling them. Does he owe you anything? Probably not, as he never entered into an arrangement with you. However, what if you find out that the money from the hot dog stand sales is being shared between the guy you sold it to and his friend? Then it looks like collusion for the sole purpose of getting out of the terms of the original contract, and you probably have a good case that you are owed some of the profits.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3s","qSentId": 11633,"question": "Ok I'm curious, the issue is not copyright infringement because they had the rights to make it, the issue is they won't honour the contract she signed with NLC.\n\nWouldn't the contract she signed be contingent on NLC owning the rights?
