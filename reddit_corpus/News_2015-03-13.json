Someone going missing isn't, by itself, evidence of a crime. That person could fall down a well, that person could have decided to join a cult and run away. There are many reasons people disappear.

There's no body. The only independent evidence they have this this witness' statement - which, honestly he may or may not have even made. Depending on the translator they had present at the time and the type of Spanish this man speaks (or it could be some funky Inca/Aztec thing) he might have said \"I don't know where she is, I know she was here when we slaughtered a pig last week and put the body in the back of the van.

", "aSentId": 17276, "answer": "Simple.\n\nIf you want to say something, you can say it. If your buddy wants to agree with you, they can too. We are people, and we have freedom of speech  \n\nCorporations aren't people, nor are they composed of people. They are pieces of paper, typically stored in a lawyers safe. Paper has no right to speech, because it can't talk  \n\nWhat's particularly insulting about corporate campaign contributions is the fact that the CEO's aren't even spending their own money to advance their points of view, they're spending their shareholders money. \n\nSmall closely held corporation where 100% of shareholders are in agreement? Maybe. Big publicly traded corporation where vast amounts of the shares aren't owned by the ceo or any other person, but instead are held by pension plans, mutual funds held in 401k's and the like, and even if campaign spending was put to a shareholder vote, you'd have the CEO recommending how to spend the shareholders money, and the rich fund manAgers rubber stamping their \"yes\" votes in agreement, meanwhile, the people whose money it actually is have no say in the matter. That's a big problem with corporate spending\n\nWhat irks me even more is, I think all voices should be equally loud, not multiplied by how many dollars a particular slender has. The Koch brothers are directing nearly a billon into the 2016 elections. Thats two voices that are loud enough to drown out thousands, even millions of ordinary people\n\nLook at the situation; if you or I want to donate to a candidate, there are strict limits to the amount of dollars we can provide their campaign. But, if you or I were wealthy enough, we could simply form a PAC, make unlimited contributions to it, and the (\"unofficially\" mind you...) coordinate with our favored candidate, so as to spend those dollars exactly how they would have spent them thrmselves, had we donated directly to their cause. \n\nPacs also destroy transparency; ordinarily, you and I and anyone else can find out who the biggest donors to a campaign are. It's public record. We can go \"oh, so mr t gave to candidate A, guess we'll know where candidate a will side on such and such issue\". Put that money into a PAC, and the public has no idea. \n\nEven worse, when donations come from individuals, we can be assured of no undo foreign influence in our campaigns. Run the money through a PAC, and China, Russia, anyone, anywhere, can attempt to buy influence. \n\nWhich is another thing. With strict campaign finance laws, and low caps per donee, there is no risk of outsize \"donations\" gaining special considerations for the donors; the limit might be $2k or $5k or $10k, whatever, no presidential candidate will feel beholden to a $10k donor to his or her $200 million dollar campaign. But instead, individual or small groups of wealthy individuals can make outsize donations to their PAC, spend how the candidate sees fit, and when that candidate reaches office and meets with those donors, they (the donors) can rightfully say \"if it wasn't for us, you wouldn't be sitting there\". Left or right, I don't think any of us wants our politicians beholden to anyone but the people who elected them.  \n\nI'm convinced that campaigns need to be 100% publicly financed. No PACs, no outside voices, every ad on the airwaves should be bought and paid for by an actual candidate, all of whom are on the exact same financial footing. \n\nThat way we can see and end to outside money corrupting out elections, whether you're a liberal blaming The Koch Brothers or a conservative pointing fingers at Soros. Right now, it's been the Koch Brithers getting the headlines for supporting conservatives, and therefore conservatives defend the Kochs. I hope it doesn't take putting the shoe on the other foot, and seeing a small group of liberal billionaires (say, soros teamed up with Gates and Buffett) for conservatives to see why there's a problem with the new political normal that's come about since citizens United. \n\nIn a country where, yes, we are free to disagree with one another, and where openness and democracy are supposedly lauded values, I would think that doing away with special interest money in our elections should be something voters from all parties could agree on.

Farmers and Shepherds with tankards of cider half way to their lips, and in a little farmhouse, Tiffany Aching replaces a tiny silver horse pendent with a tiny silver hare, the chain caught mid sway between her fingers in front of the mirror through which...\n\nGranny Weatherwax ISNT watching, her trusty \"I aint dead\" sign hanging off the doorknob behind her, Nanny bumbling around downstairs, a bottle of scumble halfway out her knicker leg, Greebo mid-yowl, backed into a corner by You. \n\nDeath looks up at Albert, now a statue proffering a cup of tea. Even the Death of Rats falls silent from another long explanation of Quantum as his master crosses to a cabinet and draws out a single, very plain hourglass, whose sands have finally stilled. There will be no ride for Binky tonight. Binky not will ride again for a very long time. One last job for Death, then he can wait. It may be a very long wait, but he is good at it.

Pratchett was my favorite author, ever. The philosophy and wisdom of Discworld sort of made me the person I am today.\n\nSo, last month, I resolved to write him a letter. He'd probably never see it, and a reply was undoubtedly beyond all hope, but at least I would know that I sent it. That I had at least tried, if only once, to talk to the man who had unwittingly become my Gandalf (or Obi-Wan, or Dumbledore, as you will).\n\nI never finished it.\n\nThe letter was sitting, half-finished, in my drive this morning. When I heard the news...Well, I finished it. Don't know if I'll ever send it. But I'll post it here, at least.\n\n\"Dear Mr. Pratchett -\nIn the fall of 2004, a friend of mine pushed a book into my hand and breathlessly whispered to me, \"Read this.\" When I looked down, I found that I was holding a curious hardback tome, laminated, as all library books were, with a cover showing a fist thrusting out of a pile of letters. I read the words on the cover. Going Postal, by Terry Pratchett. Some silly book about a post office? What could be more boring? Still, my friend wasn't usually wrong about my literary tastes.\n\nA few hours later, instead of paying attention in history class, I cracked open the book. *The flotillas of the dead sailed around the world on underwater rivers\u2026 *\n\nI devoured the book in six hours.\n\nFrom that rainy October day, I was a lost soul. I scoured the library for more books by this Terry Pratchett. I got a part time job, money to feed my obsession. Every week I had a spare bit of coin it was off to the local bookstore, where I methodically hunted down and seized every last Pratchett book they had, to be dragged kicking and screaming back to my lair. I bought the books not just for myself, no. This was too big for just one person. I became a missionary, spreading the gospel of Pratchett wherever I could. My books were resources, meant to hook new victims, luring them in to the glorious new world I had found. Countless other friends, at some point or another, have now had a Pratchett book shoved into their hands with a breathless, \"Read this.\" It was like nothing I had ever read before.\n\nDiscworld is special.\n\nPlenty of authors do humor. Plenty of authors can do fantasy. The intrigue, the mystery, all that is not difficult to find. But I have never encountered another author who can put the same amount of heart into his books. The only books I have ever cried at were Discworld novels. The only novels that always left me with the warm glow of contentment radiating through me after the end were Discworld (I can still quote from memory the last line of Witches Abroad: \"But they went the long way, and saw the elephant.\").\n\nDiscworld found me an angry, disaffected young man, right at that age where he knows everyone else in the world is wrong, where everything is awful, and he's oh-so-superior for being the one to notice that. Discworld shook me out of that state.\n\nDiscworld taught me to see the good in people. \"It takes all sorts to make a world.\" Even Ankh-Morpork's worst, most selfish, and vile characters had some nugget of goodness inside of them. The lazy, incompetent Fred Colon is still a wonderful human being. Who can fail to be charmed by CMOT Dibbler? And are there any who would not vote for self-professed tyrant Vetinari?\n\nThat, to me, was the charm of Discworld: the sheer, irrepressible love of humanity and the world that constantly shines through, no matter how dark the subject matter. Joy, love, and tolerance, not hatred, or cruelty, were truly the best ways to live (and of course, what better teacher of these things than Death Himself?).\nDiscworld made me who I am today.\n\nI learned that you have to believe the little lies as practice for the big ones.\n\nI learned that some things are important.\n\nI learned that sometimes, in the hands of the right person, glass become diamond.\n\nDiscworld is usually regulated to the fantasy and science fiction shelves. My English teachers turned up their nose at it. It was not \"serious literature.\" But I felt differently. I felt that it was the most serious literature I had ever read.\n\nThis winter of 2014, I eagerly purchased your book of essays, A Slip of the Keyboard. Afterwards, I found myself once again seriously rethinking things. I was deeply distressed to learn of how your disease has progressed, and realized that my dream of getting my copy of Going Postal signed (still my favorite, after all this time) might never be realized.

All these bills and laws are so long an have so many little loopholes it's hard to tell what they even mean most of the time. Smart people are pretty busy because they usually have pretty demanding jobs. They don't have time to read some law that's 14 pages long that got passed on a Tuesday in march. Not to mention the fact that they really can't do much about it (again; busy, no time). It's easier for people to just vote along party lines, when you have kids, a house, a career.\n\nThen there is the dumb people, they are just dumb.\n\nIt's hard to get outraged when one can't even understand what the laws mean.  We are supposed to elect representatives of our interests, but these 'representatives' aren't like the rest of us, they live different life's, run in different circle. Wasn't there some kind of congressman who said he had never sent an email before? They can't relate.  A politician's job is no longer to be a representative of the people. Now their job is to he elected and that's a major piece of the problem, possibly the biggest. But how do u get someone in office that simply wants to do a good job? It takes a cutthroat conniving sociopath to get elected because it's so damn competitive and one needs a whole lot of money to get in office\n\nEdit: let's take net neutrality for example: I am a supporter of net neutrality. I called my 'representatives' in the government. But do I really know what it means? I think I kind of do, but it seems like everyday I read something new about it. I'm sure not even close to half the American public understands it at all, probably not even 10%. I had a client the other day who thought it meant that the government was going to 'tax the internet', I don't even know what that means or how that's possible, and I know he didn't either. That's probably how most of the country thinks, they just listen to someone else's opinion because they don't have the time to research and form their own.

Of course, unless you're terminally ill, suicide ideation is a sign of mental problems and therefore the question of whether that person is competent enough to make that decision must be assessed. Personally, if a person wants to kill him/herself, I don't see why we should stop them through force of law. Sure, improve mental health access and quality for those who do have problems, but making suicide illegal across the board is contrary to personal liberty.\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by \"your right to fight others on the field of honor.\" Is this a reference to dueling? Duels to the death involve murder, which should be illegal. If you're just talking about non-lethal fighting, I'm not sure that's illegal. If two people agree of their own volition to engage in a fight, that's not illegal to my knowledge. \n\nAlso, I don't know what you're referring to when you say \"your right to personally define terms legally as you choose.\" We do have the right to have our own personal definitions. Tumblr is full of this shit and nobody has been arrested for inventing definitions that I know of. Now if you're talking about legal definitions, we do as a society have the right and duty to determine what words legally mean. Proposition 8 was precisely that. The majority of Californians decided and voted that the term marriage should legally only define a union between a man and a woman. This is not personally defining terms, as you claim, but it's a society democratically determining a legal definition for a societal institution. But Liberals don't think the people have this right. Apparently they think judges should be able to usurp the voice of the people and define terms undemocratically.\n", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l", "qSentId": 19080, "question": "They don't support a worker's choice to pay union dues or not.\n\nThey don't support a parent's choice of where to send their kids to school.\n\nThey don't support the choice of a citizen to own a firearm.\n\nThey don't support the choice of the people of any given state to define marriage.\n\nThey don't support the right for individuals to choose their own insurance policy.\n\nThey don't support the right for people to choose what size of soda, which type of light bulb or whether or not to use plastic bags.\n\nThere's a whole bunch of choices that the Left is vehemently opposed to.

The government isn't really doing much about it (read:  nothing).  The ideas they're floating around (free community college and training, raising the minimum wage, etc) are just ideas that resonate with people but lack substance.  Don't get me wrong, raising minimum wage, but in the aggregate sense, it's barely a drop in the bucket of decreasing the gap.  What about the majority of Americans?  The middle class?  Increasing the minimum wage doesn't help them out much.  What is the government going to do to help them?\n\nProblem is, the government won't even acknowledge the problem (aside from the obvious income disparity, what's CAUSING it?).  They think giving out free community college education would fix that, but when you look at the data, even those in the workforce with college degrees haven't seen their wages increase much over the years so it's not an education problem.\n\nProductivity has gone up so why haven't wages?  All you hear is rhetoric instead of an explanation as to what's going on.  A large factor isn't even complicated to explain.  Instead of passing profits to workers/reinvesting in the business to ensure growth and a strong economy companies are engaging more and more in what's known as open market stock buybacks.  This is when a company takes it profits, goes to the open market and starts buying up shares of their own stock like mad (this isn't to be confused with another type of buyback, a tender buy back where the company will go to specific shareholders and offer to buy their shares in the near future at an agreed to price, these are fine).  \n\nWith open market stock buybacks, such as the recently announced $5B stock buyback program GM recently agreed to due to pressure from Harry Wilson (investment banker/Obama administration auto task force member who helped structure the GM bailout), the company buys up a ton of shares (in GM's case, $5 billion worth) and what's that do to the outstanding shares?  It causes them to increase in value.  \n\nIn theory, shares increase in value when investors believe in the long term viability of a company, but in the cases with open market buy backs, you increase the value of shares just by simply reducing the supply of them.  Who does this benefit?  The shareholders (Harry Wilson and his hedge funds own 2% of GM stock) all of a sudden sit on shares worth a hell of a lot more money.\n\nThat's money that could've gone to employees, money that could've gone towards planning for the future, money that could've gone towards more R&amp;D, infrastructure expansion/upgrades, etc. etc. but instead it's just used to buy back shares for the benefit of investors.  Instead of buying shares and letting them soar on their own merits (good performance, profitability and viable long term business plans), some investors advocate open market buy backs so they can just cash out at a guaranteed profit at the expense of the employees and the company itself.\n\nThis trend started in the 80's when many regulations regarding repurchasing of shares were laxed.  All you have to do to keep the SEC happy is to announce your intent publicly ahead of time citing how much money you're going to spend and the time period in which that money will be spent repurchasing your own stock.\n\nIf you want to call a spade a spade, you'd just call this stock manipulation which would be illegal and against SEC regulation.  Yes the SEC regulates how much you can buy (a provision that states you can't exceed 25% of the previous four week's average daily trading volume, known as a \"safe harbor\"), but how much you buy is reported as a quarterly total, not daily so it's hard to determine if a company is in compliance with the safe harbor limit.  The SEC would need to launch an investigation into the matter, which it rarely does.\n\nYet weird, I haven't heard anyone in our government address this.  Instead they think raising minimum wage a few percentage points will magically help out a majority of Americans (this only helps the poor, which again, isn't bad but more needs to be done).\n\nI think this is why so many Americans think government is the problem.  People write their representatives and let them know how hard they're working, how productive they and their employers are, yet year after year, they see no reward for all of their collective work and their pleas fall on deaf ears.\n\nHopefully as 2016 approaches, this practice becomes more obvious to the general public so we can pressure those in office to do something about it.  I suspect that over time, these findings will shift from economic journals, business journals, and the pages of Forbes magazine and make their way into the more mainstream media.\n\nTL;DR Americans are probably sick of government because they won't address issues that affect their day to day, such as income disparity.  Americans are wondering why their wages have been stagnant for so long and under their noses, companies have been engaging in a legalized form of stock manipulation known as open market stock buybacks to benefit the super wealthy hedge fund owners and investors when that money could (and should) be used to reinvest in the business itself (such as giving employees raises among other perks).

", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l", "qSentId": 19380, "question": "I think a large issue is one that directly impacts their paychecks, income disparity.  The government isn't really doing much about it (read:  nothing).  The ideas they're floating around (free community college and training, raising the minimum wage, etc) are just ideas that resonate with people but lack substance.  Don't get me wrong, raising minimum wage, but in the aggregate sense, it's barely a drop in the bucket of decreasing the gap.  What about the majority of Americans?  The middle class?  Increasing the minimum wage doesn't help them out much.  What is the government going to do to help them?\n\nProblem is, the government won't even acknowledge the problem (aside from the obvious income disparity, what's CAUSING it?).  They think giving out free community college education would fix that, but when you look at the data, even those in the workforce with college degrees haven't seen their wages increase much over the years so it's not an education problem.\n\nProductivity has gone up so why haven't wages?  All you hear is rhetoric instead of an explanation as to what's going on.  A large factor isn't even complicated to explain.  Instead of passing profits to workers/reinvesting in the business to ensure growth and a strong economy companies are engaging more and more in what's known as open market stock buybacks.  This is when a company takes it profits, goes to the open market and starts buying up shares of their own stock like mad (this isn't to be confused with another type of buyback, a tender buy back where the company will go to specific shareholders and offer to buy their shares in the near future at an agreed to price, these are fine).  \n\nWith open market stock buybacks, such as the recently announced $5B stock buyback program GM recently agreed to due to pressure from Harry Wilson (investment banker/Obama administration auto task force member who helped structure the GM bailout), the company buys up a ton of shares (in GM's case, $5 billion worth) and what's that do to the outstanding shares?  It causes them to increase in value.  \n\nIn theory, shares increase in value when investors believe in the long term viability of a company, but in the cases with open market buy backs, you increase the value of shares just by simply reducing the supply of them.  Who does this benefit?  The shareholders (Harry Wilson and his hedge funds own 2% of GM stock) all of a sudden sit on shares worth a hell of a lot more money.\n\nThat's money that could've gone to employees, money that could've gone towards planning for the future, money that could've gone towards more R&amp;D, infrastructure expansion/upgrades, etc. etc. but instead it's just used to buy back shares for the benefit of investors.  Instead of buying shares and letting them soar on their own merits (good performance, profitability and viable long term business plans), some investors advocate open market buy backs so they can just cash out at a guaranteed profit at the expense of the employees and the company itself.\n\nThis trend started in the 80's when many regulations regarding repurchasing of shares were laxed.  All you have to do to keep the SEC happy is to announce your intent publicly ahead of time citing how much money you're going to spend and the time period in which that money will be spent repurchasing your own stock.\n\nIf you want to call a spade a spade, you'd just call this stock manipulation which would be illegal and against SEC regulation.  Yes the SEC regulates how much you can buy (a provision that states you can't exceed 25% of the previous four week's average daily trading volume, known as a \"safe harbor\"), but how much you buy is reported as a quarterly total, not daily so it's hard to determine if a company is in compliance with the safe harbor limit.  The SEC would need to launch an investigation into the matter, which it rarely does.\n\nYet weird, I haven't heard anyone in our government address this.  Instead they think raising minimum wage a few percentage points will magically help out a majority of Americans (this only helps the poor, which again, isn't bad but more needs to be done).\n\nI think this is why so many Americans think government is the problem.  People write their representatives and let them know how hard they're working, how productive they and their employers are, yet year after year, they see no reward for all of their collective work and their pleas fall on deaf ears.\n\nHopefully as 2016 approaches, this practice becomes more obvious to the general public so we can pressure those in office to do something about it.  I suspect that over time, these findings will shift from economic journals, business journals, and the pages of Forbes magazine and make their way into the more mainstream media.\n\nTL;DR Americans are probably sick of government because they won't address issues that affect their day to day, such as income disparity.  Americans are wondering why their wages have been stagnant for so long and under their noses, companies have been engaging in a legalized form of stock manipulation known as open market stock buybacks to benefit the super wealthy hedge fund owners and investors when that money could (and should) be used to reinvest in the business itself (such as giving employees raises among other perks).  This is a dangerous practice that benefits few and carries a large opportunity cost for the businesses who engage in frequent stock buybacks.\n", "aSentId": 19409, "answer": "Thanks for this.

You want them to invest in more infrastructure? They didn't need it because consumer demand was down through the recession. You want them to pay their workers more?

ANH is a company that buys mortgage-backed securities and pays the interest from them to its investors. This is a crowded field, and there are 6-10 public companies that follow very similar strategies. ANH's management is by far the worst. They've continually underperformed their competition.  Consequently, they traded at a 20% discount to their book value. That means for each dollar of stock they bought back, they were getting $1.25 in book value. Pretty good deal, right? But management didn't want to do buybacks because it would reduce their assets-under-management and thus their fees. So an activist investor group bought up a substantial fraction of the company, and threatened to push out management if they didn't start doing buybacks and other shareholder-friendly policies. ANH started buying back its shares, book value and earnings per share went up, and everybody won except incompetent management.  \n  \nI don't see how anything in that story is barely-legal \"stock manipulation\" or in any way a fundamental cause of our economic problems today.

Traditionally, investments (particularly long term investments and investments large enough to earn you a seat at the board) are meant to mutually benefit two parties, the investor and the company.  The investor sees potential success in the company and fronts capital, in exchange the company must execute on the plan they sold to said investor.  If the plan works, the company grows and the investor makes money.\n\nI'm not advocating the total ban of open market stock buybacks since, as you've mentioned, they can be useful in combating hostile takeovers (let's be honest, no one is trying to takeover a corporation as large as Exxon in a hostile manner), rewards shareholders (but so do dividends), and improves EPS.  I just want more stringent rules in place to prevent mismanagement of such initiatives.  If a company has excess cash reserves net of internal investments and initiatives then sure, announce an open market stock buy back if they deem it more advantageous than increasing dividend payments.\n\nAs I mentioned in my original post, tender offers I have absolutely no issue with because it does the same thing as you mentioned.  Takes someone with a substantial ownership stake and gives them an out and an opportunity to take advantage of the low stock price.  If you think the share price is below the intrinsic value of the potential of the company and you have the cash reserves on hand NET of the company's investment plans and goals, then tender offers are a great option.  These aren't nearly as common as open market buy backs though.\n\nYou seem like a guy who's knowledgeable in the subject so I'm glad you chimed in.  Now with so many upper management and executive pay is stock based to some degree or another (the theory being your pay should be tied to how well the business does, the business does well, share price grows therefore you earn more money) however, this has created a massive incentive to perform open market buy backs on a large and systemic scale as a way to shortcut the system the way it was intended.  \n\nInstead of using retained earnings to invest in the company itself (which yes may or may not include pay raises for staff, hiring more employees, etc), these massive open market buy backs benefit only one party and potentially puts a company in a bad situation in the event of an economic downturn or industry changes by having a lack of capital.  GM fell victim of this when it needed a bailout.\n\nWhile I don't necessarily think outright banning the practice would be the answer, it should be discussed as an option.  But I'd need to know what the long term damage open market repurchases have had on capital formation to make a decision on that.\n\nAnother one is to place stipulations on stock-based pay.  Perhaps by limiting how upper management and executives can sell stock right after they exercise their options.  Perhaps say that they must hold onto the stock for x months or face extra taxes.\n\nBasically I want stock based compensation to work the way it was intended.  You are paid based upon specific performance initiatives that reflect the productive capabilities of a firm over the long term.  With this growing trend in open market buy backs, the pay is more and more based on solely stock performance.  This is largely why you see such large gains in the \"1%\" while wages for the middle class stay stagnant.\n\nIf you were a business owner who was traded publicly, who would you rather on your board?
