I have what coming from me is basically speculation, but i believe they salted meats and most parts of a animal were used for tools and clothing so hunting wasnt always done just for the meat. Been some years since i looked this up but i read a article online at the time about how they salted meat and how it would last even by todays standards a incredibly long time. My guess is it likely tasted awful though. Some places and cultures also used ice as a way to store perishable food by cutting it from  lakes in cold areas like near mountains or they would dig deep holes to store food underground in a cold enviroment. For nomadic hunter gatherers some of these are likely not valid options though. It also dont take to long to skin and cut up a buffalo. Think of modern hunting, even today many hunters deal with their own kills and using just kitchen knives it takes a little while but for the amount of food you get from it, its really not all that long. If you have a whole tribe working on it which likely at the time is how it went then they could make some fairly quick work of a good amount of buffalo.\n\nBack then they also didnt have distractions like we have today. Life consisted of mostly just making food (weather hunting or farming) and sleeping and dependent on who we are talking about some building.

Mount Bayonets!\n\n* I order you not to attack, I order you to *die*!  In the time it takes for us to die other troops and commanders will have time to arrive and hold this ridge.\n\n\nSuffice it to say, the Ottomans carried the day, at terrible losses.

He was essentially in charge of the regiment during that action. It was fairly common for divisional commanders to take such actions (ex. Paul Litzmann at Lodz 1914), and even most corps commanders had a forward command post on the western front. The fact remains that Kemal was taking a HUGE risk, with his own life, with his men's morale, and with his unit's command structure by placing himself in that situation, and it was under extreme circumstances (ie SOMEONE had to stop the enemy from leaving the beach).\n\nAs I said before, the British paid a high price at Loos, 3 divisional commanders killed and one captured, for similar actions, and field Marshall French's presence on the battlefield and visiting the wounded crucially delayed the release of the British reserves, sabotaging any hopes of greater success. Having your commander in the frontlines in action is like having your brain in your foot playing soccer: if something goes wrong, you're buggered. \n\nIdeally, the challenge to a WWI general was to find a happy medium between two extremes: on the one hand, never visiting the front and being entirely aloof to the situation on the ground; on the other, leading charges with reckless abandon that puts your life in danger, jeopardizes the chain-of-command, and prevents you from directing ALL the units below you, and from attaining a better picture of the overall situation via Intel.

Here's the first Punic War.  Mamertines punch Messana in the crotch. When Syracuse comes over to calm things down, the Mamertines punch him in the face, calling out for Carthage and Rome to help him out.  Carthage comes over and tells Syracuse he'll calm Mamertines down, Rome comes over and punches Carthage in the face (well, tries to. Rome didn't have boats which made the punch a bit hard to land at first... this analogy is falling apart).  Then Rome and Carthage start their First Punic War fistfight. \n\nInstigator: Rome, but Carthage was game for a fight because Sicily is important.\n\nSecond Punic War: Often viewed as Hannibal's war, it's really the whole Barca family against all of Rome (and particularly the Scipii family).  This one was started when Hannibal attacked the city of Seguntum, whose independence was part of the pax treaty with Rome, and followed this up with his infamous mountain march into the heart of Italy.  The War going on in the Mediterranean was pretty standard for antagonistic major powers: Carthage tried to take Lilybaeum, but failed, the consul at the time got ready for an Africa invasion, which would probably lead to some swapping of island territory and another uneasy truce with the Carthaginian Council.\n\nBut then Hannibal came down from the mountains and changed the game, as the Romans were no longer paying attention to attacking Carthage itself, they were scrambling to survive Hannibal in Italy, and by extension his two brothers in Iberia, Hasdrubal and Mago.  There was little direct support from Carthage proper.  It was almost entirely Iberian troops with Gallic allies gained when Rome was down.  In fact, had Carthage committed more to the war, and sent Hannibal reinforcements when he needed them, that might have been the end of Rome (it sure seemed like it was four or five times over).  Once Hannibal had finally been beaten, by Scipio Africanus, there wasn't really a question of going and defeating Carthage, because Hannibal had retreated to Africa.  What were they going to do, let this monster who had massacred generations of Romans get away?\n\nInstigator: Carthage, but mostly the Barcas\n\nThird Punic War: Really, how long can you listen to Cato the Elder end every single speech with \"Carthago delenda est\" or \"it is my opinion that Carthage must be destroyed\" before you say \"Fine! Go salt their fields already.\"  \n\nInstigator: Rome, well on their way to encircling the Mediterranean. \n\nThere's a million and one caveats and conditions: Even defeated, Carthage would often regain their footing financially far faster than anyone in Rome was happy with, there were always people (the Scipii family and Cato the Elder are only examples) itching to attack the Carthaginians.  Ancient writers followed the rules of the day: Rome never started an unjust war, and only entered into battle when provoked, so they would highlight 1: the call for aid by the Mamertines 2: the taking of Seguntum 3: the breaking of the peace treaty when the Carthaginians defended their borders against Numidia (the treaty included a provision that all border disputes be arbitrated by Rome).  Modern writers look at these justifications and tend to acknowledge that, really, Rome was on the rise: the first war was a daring and difficult gamble that won them Sicily, the second was two world powers clashing epically, and the third was almost a footnote on the now inexorable rise of Rome to one of the greatest civilizations in history.
