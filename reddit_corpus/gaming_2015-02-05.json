I used [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsFqFmj2Org) as my guide.  \n\nA couple things to note:  \n\n* The controller takes more force to open then you would think. Pop off each 'leg' a little bit, and then work on one by wiggling it and pulling it. In the video he's trying to hold on each trigger while popping it off, but I found this kind of difficult to do.  \n* Most likely one of your triggers will come off. There is a tiny spring that will pop out when the trigger comes off. I had one fall into the open controller, and another on the floor. Make sure you are on a rather big surface so you can spot it as it falls out. In the last third of the video he explains how to put the trigger back on. I recommend putting it on first to get it out of the way.  \n* In the video, he leaves the battery on. I found taking off the battery was much easier to put the sticks on. The battery pops out easily from the controller board (the white connector on the board).   \n* There are two different types of controllers. Sony updated the dual shock. They look very similar on the outside, but the main difference is the 2nd ribbon on the inside for the light sensor. He uses needle nose pliers in the video. I highly recommend a good pair of tweezers instead. It is a very tiny space that the ribbon slides back into once you are reassembling.  \n* Instead of taking out the board, I gently lifted the board from the bottom and flipped it so it was kind of sitting up. I popped off each analog stick and put the X1 ones on.  \n* The sticks took more effort to put on then in the video. In fact, I had to look at the bottom of the sticks and I noticed that one side was kind of flat-ish, and I had to line it up with the peg coming off of the controller. It's more of an oval with the sides being more flat, then a circle. Make sure you slide them on all the way.  \n* Test every function of your controller after complete. Every button and the touchpad worked fine for me.  \n\nGood luck!","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh03","qSentId": 4518,"question": "Do you have a tiny pet giraffe by chance ?","aSentId": 4519,"answer": "Not yet but if you know where I can get one?!.....\n\n\"Opulence, I has it.\"","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh03","qSentId": 4522,"question": "Re-type your title and this may hit the front page.","aSentId": 4523,"answer": "\"My autistic atheist daughter made this controller with her allowance earned from helping the homeless in memory of our sadly passed away kitten.

When you think about it, a PS2 controller has 12 BUTTONS. Laying that out on a control panel is not only awkward (controllers have been tediously designed to fit in your hands to utilize every finger comfortably), but looks ugly too. Even at 8 buttons is starts to get messing and confusing for new players.\n\nAll 16:9 arcade games are modern ones (there are some dual screen classic games that would actually exceed the 16:9 ratio, but look bad on nearly any screen you play them on). And most likely emulation is not available for them as of yet.\n\nI see a lot of widescreen MAME cabs these days, and while they are pretty, they are simply unnecessary.

There were hard unit counters (you couldn't just build a million of the same unit and bury the opposing player). Mobility, seige, and damage types were all well balanced. The factions were well differentiated without being completely obtuse. Games didn't drag on, they tended to *end* shortly after they were *over*. Contrasted with other more defense oriented games that can become a boring war of attrition as you eat through fortifications.\n\nI also really enjoyed the shipment system. Encouraged activity in the game while also providing some individual flavor to the build orders.\n\nMy only criticism is that the successive expansions made too many changes.

","aSentId": 8544,"answer": "I thought the same as you on Heroes of the Storm at first. Blizzard was getting into the MOBA market way too late, and took way too much time trying to fight Valve for the rights to DotA. But, after playing Heroes of the Storm for quite a bit during Alpha and now Beta, I think it's going to cater to a whole different kind of player. I'm far more casual than I used to be for gaming, and Heroes fits me very well. There aren't a ton of items to learn like there was for League when I started a few years ago, because they don't exist. You learn approximately what the champions can do, and go from there. It makes the barrier of entry to the game so much smaller than games like League and DotA. Don't get me wrong, I still love DotA and will play LoL from time to time because my friends refuse to move on to better games, but I think Heroes has a solid place in the MOBA market because of the simplified barrier of entry, the characters you get to play are characters a lot of people were obsessed with in their early/recent gaming days, and it's quite a bit more casual.\n\nEdit: I should clarify that I wasn't some random that got burned out on League or DotA because I didn't know what I was doing. I haven't played for well over a year and had over 3k wins unranked (so probably 6k games altogether since I did a lot of arranged games with my friends and some of them weren't very good) and [Steam says](https://steamdb.info/calculator/76561197986298617/) I have over 400 hours in Dota2, god knows how much time in w3 dota.
