I very few love stories, so perhaps this wasn't my kind of book. I came in expecting time travel, and got a love story and what I consider to be an unimaginative plot.

Protag tries to rekindle relationship with love interest, success is guaranteed, but more strained than it was originally. Something happens during the assassination that causes love interest to either die again or get stuck in the same situation where she can't be with the protag. (Did you REALLY expect a 100% happy ending?) Protag tries to restart timeline to disastrous results. Accepts that he can't change anything, returns either to his own original timeline or revised one, and lives out his life. And lo and behold... I'm not saying this isn't a good storyline, or a moving one, or whatever. I'm just saying it's entirely predictable, and I was quite disappointed that it was so apparent.](#s)\n\n[I mean, how else could the story possibly go?

And given how much of a liar he is (justifiably so?) I was unimpressed at his wooing and their chemistry. It was built on lies. Anyway, the story was all about HIM, and how he manipulated her for her own safety and for the achievement of his goal of saving JFK.

And then the later two books are about other characters and their stories, and from them, we fill those gaps and learn more about Crake from a different perspective.\n\nTheir stories are quite interesting (more so than Jimmy's, IMHO), but the slow piecing together of Crake's story felt like the thing that tied it all together.\n\nAnyway, if you've managed to get through the first book, then you really should read the next two.

Frankly, I've found high school kids more willing to tackle tough issues and questions than most adults are, even if they don't perhaps have the framework to really balance an argument against reality yet.\n\nI realize that my view of YA may be a bit myopic, but frankly, I do see YA as a lesser genre.  If it were more, it would just be literature or fiction or sci-fi.  I don't see Ender's Game as YA.  To me, Ender is sci-fi, and one of the *pillars* of sci-fi at that.  One of the ways I define YA fiction is that because it's written for an audience that doesn't have the perspective of age, a lot of the conflicts are presented without that same perspective.  Which is not to say it has to be *bad* writing, but writing with that level of maturity almost automatically elevates the story out of YA and into straight-up fiction, in my book.  I know it's not exactly fair to relegate YA to a writing ghetto like we did with animation for so long, but I do regard it as lesser to literature in the same way that I would not expect Pokemon to have the same morality or perspective as an adult drama.\n\nAs far as what I liked about it, I think it largely comes down to seeing something new.  I'm not a huge fan of Vonnegut's writing, but I do like the way he teaches about story sometimes.  One of those basic tenants of writing I share with other writers is that the protagonist of the story should be the character who most affects and advances the plot.  Experienced writers know that these rules exist because it's generally the best way to tell a story, but rules are also made to be broken, and it can be made to work.  I thought this was one of those times.  I don't think Collins is a fantastic writer, but she is good enough to get away with making Katniss largely reactionary.  Things happen *to* her, but she doesn't generally get the chance to behave in a way that creates conflict, while all around her other people (mostly the adults, which is pretty unique, too) are doing the work, calling the shots, and largely offering her sound advice that she ignores in her emotional, desperate plea to just be allowed to *affect* something.\n\nThe books at large made me feel almost physically ill when I read them, because it was pretty much just a bleak, unrepentantly dark kick to the gut that never let up.  Even the so-called happy ending is really just a big, shoulder-shrugging \"well, shit, what now?\"  That counts for me, as even that sort of reaction is at least something I was compelled to feel from the story.  I do think it's an improvement over most YA writing, which can fall into either a hugbox'd cliche, absurdly tween-y \"kiss all the boys\" plots, or your default \"let's save the world because adults are useless\" story.  I definitely wouldn't put it on any \"Best of\" lists, and I'd definitely use it as a gateway to try to get kids to read some deeper, more meaty fare\u2014but for what it is, when it came out, and who it was for; I still feel like it does its job.\n\n/$0.02", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh4i", "qSentId": 12231, "question": "My problem with Hunger Games is that Katniss never faces a morally challenging situation.

She ALWAYS acts out of self defense, or on behalf of someone \"weaker\". For a book about kids killing kids... that's pretty lame.

They execute their orders or they're fucked.\n\nI don't know why you mention Ender's Game. You have to get into the sequels, after Ender is no longer a child soldier, to get that. The only moral choice in the time period of the first book is made by Bean, right at the very end, it's only depicted in Ender's Shadow, and honestly not much is made of it, he's basically meant to be depicted as a hero for making it.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh4i", "qSentId": 12223, "question": "Mockingjay gets the reputation for being the worst out of the series.

So I wet it, then dab/roll it on paper towel (make sure to get any spots on the wood handle) and it has a nice point I can dab in paint and do the detailed edges of small sections. The brush will dry and you'll notice because the bristles will separate, getting into paint and making stray lines. Just get it wet and roll again. Also, working with just the point, paint kind of collects mid bristle into a clump that make my point fatter and fatter. For that I just run the paint off on a paper towel.\n\nThe harder part was paint mixing. The wet color doesn't look like the dry color. I mix my paint on a tupperware lid. Start with the light color then add the darker color a little at a time. Paintwork was really good at having the mixed colors actually be 50/50 which is so helpful. I painted a bit along the edge, especially near like colors, and let it dry before continuing. \n\nGo from lightest color to darkest because if the lighter colors go over the edge onto a darker color, it will leave a smear you will have trouble hiding.

This article seems to echo things I've read elsewhere about the situation.", "aSentId": 14182, "answer": "This is what I heard from the Sad Puppies crowd:\n\nIn previous votes for the Hugo awards, there were widespread social media and twitter campaigns to promote voting for certain books simply because of the author's gender identity and/or for certain politics books promote\u2014while also disparaging certain book nominations because they found the politics of the author or what the book promotes to be disagreeable regardless of whether it was a good story. Like for instance, campaigns to vote for books simply for the reason of using newer avant-guarde gender pronouns.\n\nApparently the awards had skewed a certain political slant for some time, but there wasn't as much of active voting campaigns to promote it until relatively recently.\n\nMany people were upset that other criteria were being used to promote voting for certain books that weren't simply about how good the story was in their opinion, and the response was essentially: \"well if there really is so many of you who didn't like the outcome of the awards, you should have gotten you and your friends to vote in the nomination process like everyone else.\"\n\nSo that's what a bunch of SciFi fans and authors did. The first 2 years it was sort of an unsuccessful inside joke, but this year they decided to be more serious about it.\n\nThis year, they picked a bunch of books by what they thought were the story merits rather than expressly trying to promote certain politics or gender identities or desired ratio of author demographics, and picked a bunch of books that otherwise wouldn't have had a chance at the Hugo awards. \n\nThe books Sad Puppies chose weren't *because* of their gender or identity, but still ended up having a diverse mixture of genders and identities in their nominees anyway.\n\nEdit: [I think this is the guy who started the voting campaign.](http://monsterhunternation.com/2015/04/06/a-letter-to-the-smofs-moderates-and-fence-sitters-from-the-author-who-started-sad-puppies/)", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh4i", "qSentId": 14167, "question": "Hugo Award nominations spark row over diversity in sci-fi", "aSentId": 14184, "answer": "TL;DR Some Sci Fi authors say Hugo awards are biased. They mobilize voters, get called racists.\n\nI've been following the whole Sad Puppies mess since Correia talked about it three years ago. Disclaimer -- I read Larry Correia's blog because I'm a gun nut and I like some of his gun nut writing. His blogging eventually convinced me to try his books, which are good fun, but definitely light pulp.\n\nThe Hugos are traditionally voted on by a) people who go to worldcon and b) people who buy a supporting worldcon membership and don't go to worldcon.\n\nOver the years this group has evolved its own subculture, as all groups do. This subculture currently leans very progressive, and has a fair amount of overlap with what detractors might call \"Social Justice Warriors.\" They have certain tastes in Sci Fi, and certain favorite authors  -- mostly other progressives who write progressive stories about progressive topics like environmentalism, racism, and gender.\n\nSo while \"the Hugo awards\" have a lot of credibility among Sci Fi fans, they represent the opinions of this small group of dedicated fans, whose interests diverge from the Sci Fi audience at large. I don't think *anyone* disputes this so far, just whether this is a good thing or a bad thing.\n\nLarry Correia is a libertarian-conservative leaning Sci Fi author, who is a bit abrasive, and a bit of a loudmouth (he will not dispute this). He claims to have been made to feel very unwelcome at Worldcon when he was nominated, because of the politics on his blog (this was before he rocked the boat with sad puppies). He also claims to know many other Sci Fi authors who felt the same way, and felt that they had to keep their political leanings hidden or face rejection by the Worldcon award-voting community.\n\nAdditionally, he felt that many deserving works were ignored for awards because they did not fit into the Worldcon-voters' ideals of sci fi -- ideals that he considered to be boring and preachy.\n\nSo he publicly told all of his fans about this, and that they could buy Worldcon voting membership for $40. He encouraged them to do so and vote for books they liked. He gave them a list of books that *he* liked, that they might vote for if they liked them, too. Books that he felt would not get voted for by the existing Worldcon subculture.\n\nHe also did this while being as abrasive, loudmouthed, and politically incorrect as possible. Because that's who he is.\n\nNow, telling people \"go vote for my stuff\" or \"go vote for this person's stuff\" already edged the line of what was considered \"good manners\" at WorldCon. Everyone *did* it, but they were supposed to be subtle about it. Correia was not subtle.\n\nThe next year, he was even less subtle, and organized a larger campaign, along with several other authors, to \"get out the vote\" for WorldCon. He peppered this with appeals to take back the Sci Fi awards from people who had \"politicized\" it. A few of his suggestions were nominated. A few won, but most didn't.\n\nThis year, the campaign was repeated (although run by Brad Torgersen instead), and was successful enough to put several of their suggested worked on each slate. Their goal, in their own words, is to get more stories of the types they like nominated for the Hugo awards, with a secondary goal of sticking it to the people they see as too politically correct and stuffy (ie, the existing WorldCon voters).\n\nThe objections to these tactics have been primarily twofold:\n\na) Sad Puppies (the tongue-in-cheek name of these movements) are going too far in encouraging bloc voting, are corrupting the voting process, and will lead to greater politicization of the awards.\n\nb) Sad Puppies' dislike of \"Political Correctness\" is actually a bunch of privileged racism and misogyny that is trying to undo the progress made in Sci Fi in recent years in terms of recognizing authors of diverse backgrounds.\n\nKeep in mind, that the number of \"additional\" votes raised by Sad Puppies appears to be around 200-300 new people, out of roughly 2,200 WorldCon voters registered.\n\nIn response, many people are *freaking out* and calling Brad Torgersen, Larry Correia, and any of the authors they recommended nasty names. They are saying they will vote \"no award\" over anyone they recommended.\n\nThe Sad Puppies group say that it is odd that their motives are considered to be racism or conservatism, given that they recommended works by authors with diverse racial and political background.\n\nBoth groups claim that they just want to see books judged on their merits, not their politics or the race of their author. Both sides generally seem to be talking past each other.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh4i", "qSentId": 14186, "question": "In summary: both sides largely claim to be doing the same thing - voting for books purely based on their merit, rather than who the author is.

They were intent on not changing or adapting to their new environment/host country, which I thought was a shame. \n\nHow long did you live in Rome? Have you had the opportunity to return to Rome?

Take Seinfeld for example, many episodes have a very clever \"story arc\" within an episode where the various character's seemingly independent activities all tie in toward the end. The humor goes beyond a single punchline and incorporates the entire progression of the episode.\n\nIn The Raincoat episode, George makes up some excuse about traveling to Paris to get out of helping a kid reunite with his father as part of a Big Brother program. It turns out the father is in Paris. Meanwhile, Jerry's parents who are visiting from Florida make up an excuse about being busy to avoid George's parents. Kramer wears a coat that Jerry's father designed, and says they are big sellers at some store, so Jerry's father calls his friend in Florida to send them up. He leaves the door unlocked and their house is robbed, so they end up canceling the trip to Paris. Kramer goes over to their house on the day they were \"busy\" and tells George, who then tells his parents that they lied about being busy. Because their house was robbed, the Seinfeld's cancel the trip to Paris and end up going on a cruise sometime later. George then gets the non-refundable tickets to Paris to be a \"hero\" by reuniting the obnoxious kid with his father. George's parents end up being on the same cruise as the Seinfelds at the very end.\n\nWhile pretty absurd, it's typically somewhat relatable. Different characters are lying to avoid obligations, which ends up backfiring through a series of interconnected events. \n\nAn obscure literary reference doesn't make a show smart. Having Archer say \"I would prefer not\" and then mentioning Bartleby isn't that clever.
