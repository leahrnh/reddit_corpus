Like here, \"[Ura Zelda] it contains some new content and some which had been cut from Ocarina due to constraints on development time and on cartridge storage size.\" This was talking about Ura Zelda, or The Master Quest.\n\n&gt;According to the designer it wasn't very different fron OoT; \"It will not unlock anything special\"\n\nA fairly intact equivalent to Ura Zelda, as confirmed by designers Shigeru Miyamoto and Eiji Aonuma, was released for the GameCube in 2002 in Japan as Zeruda no Densetsu: Toki no Okarina GC Ura (\u30bc\u30eb\u30c0\u306e\u4f1d\u8aac \u6642\u306e\u30aa\u30ab\u30ea\u30ca GC\u88cf?) and in 2003 in North America and Europe as The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Master Quest.[76][80] Miyamoto explained in 2002, \"[Ura] didn't use many of the special [64DD] features. So it was very easy to port over to the GameCube without cutting any features. Ura Zelda isn't very different from the Ocarina of Time; it's more of a second quest ... it will not unlock anything special.\"[80] Aonuma concluded in 2004, \"It was finally bundled in the GameCube version of Ocarina and released as Master Quest.\"[76]\n\nAgain, this was regarding Ura Zelda in other worlds The Master Quest. Reread this section\n\nAfter the completion of Ocarina of Time, an expansion disk for the yet unreleased 64DD peripheral was developed with the working title Ura Zelda,[76] commonly translated as \"Another Zelda\".[77] Described as \"Ocarina '\u200bs second version with rearranged dungeon gameplay\",[76] it contains some new content and some which had been cut from Ocarina due to constraints on development time and on cartridge storage size.[70][78][79] However, the title was delayed indefinitely since 1998 due to the uncertain development status of the requisite 64DD device,[78] and then was never released in its originally planned form due to the 64DD's ultimate commercial failure.[80]\n\n&gt;basically. It is poorly written, because no english. It is misleasing and represents a misunderstanding of the article linked to because every statement in the title is not coherent with the article.\n\nYou're the only person in this thread that didn't understand the title, and article. I suggest going back and rereading the entire section instead of skimming for keywords. And reread the title, this time without the hyphens. Hyphen are used to cut up the sentence, and without it the sentence would still mean the same exact thing. \n\n\"The Ocarina of Time would been a massive game but Nintendo cut the games content tremendously due to the fact that the N64s cartridge could not hold that much memory. The additional content was put off indefinitely.\"\n\nSo go back and reread that entire section, and if you still don't understand the title then say where it got confusing. Just saying its not english, and misleading, doesn't mean it is. Again, you are the only one that didn't understand it and if it doesn't make sense to you then please elaborate.", "aSentId": 24185, "answer": "I don't understand where you want to prove me wrong anywhere here?

They thought that given Ocarina's expense, even a successful release might only be modestly profitable, so releasing an expansion a year later would help make more money from the project. The expansion was to patch in new dungeons, enemies, and sidequests.\n\nOcarina and its expansion were both intended for the 64DD, which was to come out in 1997. But during early development, they found that the 64DD's read speed was so slow that it limited the game in various ways. It made movements laggy, since they didn't have enough memory to hold all the movement animations in memory and so had to read it from the disk (apparently they didn't want to simplify the animations, which I totally get because the game had amazing animation for the time), and it limited their use of sound effects and music, which sucked because music is obviously a big part of the game.

They thought that given Ocarina's expense, even a successful release might only be modestly profitable, so releasing an expansion a year later would help make more money from the project. The expansion was to patch in new dungeons, enemies, and sidequests.\n\nOcarina and its expansion were both intended for the 64DD, which was to come out in 1997. But during early development, they found that the 64DD's read speed was so slow that it limited the game in various ways. It made movements laggy, since they didn't have enough memory to hold all the movement animations in memory and so had to read it from the disk (apparently they didn't want to simplify the animations, which I totally get because the game had amazing animation for the time), and it limited their use of sound effects and music, which sucked because music is obviously a big part of the game.

A branded set of golf clubs? Expensive watches? Fast cars? The fact is that gaming has become mainstream entertainment and people are willing to spend money on their hobby. \n\nA nice set of golf clubs can go for hundreds, even thousands of dollars. IMO, spending money on golf is inane, it is a stupid sport that take up too much land, too much resources, and elitist as fuck, where powerful people go and make unscrupulous background dealings.

To me that's a serious decision that people need to think about more when funding these games.\n\nThat man who buys his golf clubs gets to keep his clubs, he gets them within a decent time frame also. Star citizen could turn out to be a god awful husk of what the developers are striving for, with no real proof in my eyes that they are going to hit their goals yet.\n\nIf it were a completed game running this system, say it was comparing a expensive EVE ship to a top of the line guitar that costs \u00a35k. Then we can get into arguments about the tangibility and worth of virtual items versus real world purchases. And lets face it that isn't a totally simple discussion to have on it's own. But whilst the game is so early on to have that much faith and blind purchasing in something is crazy, Star Citizen are artificially making people feel like this content is worth such outrageous prices. But it isn't even content yet, it's not even remotely real in the virtual world at this point. To me it has no worth til the game is out and successful.\n\nAttributing worth to virtual items is one thing, when the proof of concept hasn't really reach fruition yet I personally feel it's kind of outrageous to have such packages.\n\nYou buy an amazing guitar, golf clubs, car or anything of that nature and you know what you are getting. You can also no doubt get warranties and all kinds of assurances about the product you are buying. If Star Citizen turns out to simply not be that good a game, in 6 months your purchase will be all but nothing when the masses stop playing it.\n\nI have no real issue with people making such purchases beyond how it effects games (I can easily see SC being p2w regardless of promises, as the userbase already proves they will buy and pay anything).

The developer (CIG) has repeatedly promised that it will be possible to get any and all ships in the final game without paying money.\n\nYou can buy/pre-order the game for around $40, and if you want access to alpha/beta modules or a nicer ship there are many packages that cost more, ranging from normal videogame price (aorund 55-70 USD) to expensive (100 USD and up). Buying a more expensive ship is basically the equivalent of donating to development so the game can get made, and as a kickback you get another ship when the game starts so instead of having to earn your way up from nothing (which, in my opinion, will be half the fun) you start out with a bigger spaceship right away.\n\nI think it's a cool option for people who already WANT to give a lot of money to supporting the projet, and CIG is very open about their development process so the community has been very involved in watching the game get made and in giving feedback.

So answer me these questions:\n\n* Why does star citizen have ships that still cost hundreds/thousands?\n\n* Why Are they still planning to implement more microtransactions to merely test ships?\n\nYes you can get REC through playing the game, but they've made it available to buy it with real money.

I'm probably misinterpreting part of your post, but it seems to me like you said that they're making REC avaliable for real money, which is not true. There are no planned micro-transactions to test ships. \n\nNow, what separates CIG from EA/Ubisoft is that all funding is being routed directly back into development. Anyone buying a $1200 Idris (which you can't since CIG limits how many are sold for balance purposes) is putting $1200 directly towards development.\n\nWhen you're buying DLC from EA/Ubisoft, you're not directly funding development. Sure, part of the cost will go towards making back the money they invested in development, but most of it is pure profit. You can buy 15,000 copies of one DLC package, but that money won't be put back into making the game better and will just line someones pocket.

The $15,000 game package simply includes all the ships one can buy during funding (not all ships will be up for sale), and it's actually cheaper to simply buy all the packages individually. \n\nThe ships are all specialized and there is no \"single best ship\" as different ships fulfill different roles.

I should also probably mention that in reality a combat capable Javelin would be worth far more than $2500 if it were put on sale right now, but it was sold stripped of it's gear so that player organizations can spend the first few weeks arming it.\n\nThe guy who has the $30 aurora package wouldn't actually be fighting the guy in the $1200 Idris. The Aurora would be faster, and the Idris's guns would be too big and slow. It's like trying to kill a fly with a sledge hammer. Possible, but not not very practical.\n\nThe other thing is, the game will be instanced. The game doesn't inherently want to throw you into the same instance as a pirate with a ship that can stomp you. It's statistically far more likely to throw you into a far fight. It might still put you up against that Pirate, but odds are this won't happen.

I know guys working on pipelines that make $35+/hr plus per diem. I also know guys I also know guys who weld stainless pipe all day every day for $28/hr with no per diem. \n\nSo to answer your question: it *can* pay well.

Plus, retailers are totally within their rights to sell games as used, just as stores and individuals can sell on pre-owned cars, baby items, clothes, furniture, other electronics, pretty much anything.
