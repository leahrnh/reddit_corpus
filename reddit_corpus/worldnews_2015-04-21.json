To the best of my imperfect knowledge philosophy does not follow the scientific method for analyzing claims. It doesn't use experimentation and statistical analysis to evaluate their claims which are then evaluated and retested for their ability to both predict outcomes and be reproduced. Instead it seems to me to focus on though experiments and seems prescientific in its method of evaluating the world around us.

Egypt, Jordan, and Syria line up their troops on Israel's border, a clear intention of invasion.  What atrocity did Israel commit here?\n\n* Yom Kippur War - on the holiest day of the Jewish calendar, Egypt launches a sneak attack in order to re-capture the Sinai and defeat Israel.  What provoked them?\n\n* 2006 Lebanon War - Hebollah and Hamas invade Israel and kidnap soldiers in order to hold them hostage.  Israel responds.  What provoked that?\n\n* Protective Edge - Hamas kidnaps and murders 3 Israeli teenagers.  Israel ransacks Hebron and the surrounding area, arresting known Hamas members in the process.  Hamas fires rockets in retaliation and after multiple requests to stop, Israel engages.

Any other examples of clear-cut Israeli attacks that directly and intentionally kill innocent civilians?\n\n&gt; Besides that the Israeli people seem to enjoy voting people that call for genocide into office, so I have trouble believing they really want to live in peace.\n\nBy that logic, why would anybody trust the Palestinians want to live in peace?

No more checkpoints, no more walls (unless Cubans become a problem) We can bring the wailing wall stone by stone and set it up in the Everglades. You can put your Haredim in the everglades too at the end of long causeways.\n\nNo more Arabs, No more Turks, No more Parsis, No more Syrians, No more Pakistanis, No more Russians looking to paint your wagon dead. Nice weather. They can start being friends with the U.N. for a change. Simon Wiesenthal is closer to south America. No rockets. No nail bombs in the settlers' kindergartens. Antisemitism will be slashed in half. Nuclear War could be averted. Southern Florida would experience a financial boom from all of the Wall Street and London billy boy donations. The Jews can be brokers of trade to Latin America. Lots of suckers and child brides, my God it's talmudic paradise.

They were getting an independent organization to perform their own tsunami calculations to make sure it was right before upgrading their tsunami wall. \n\nWhen the plant was built, massive earthquakes were the concern. One way to reduce the potential damage of an earthquake is to lower the plant elevation and to put critical equipment in lower levels of the plant. All the emergency batteries and the switchgear/power busses for the emergency systems were in the basement of a building. This made them vulnerable to flooding scenarios. But there was no analysis that existed until late 2009 that even hinted that a tsunami that large to flood the site could occur. Which is why having stuff in the basement was considered acceptable. \n\nUnfortunately, when they first discovered the potential for a massive tsunami, they were short sighted.

I see international students coming in who are quite intelligent and clever, but struggle with communicating effectively, are graded poorly and treated poorly by their professors (go to the writing centre to fix your grammar!) and feel discouraged. These students think that grammar is the most important thing in writing. They do not really understand how college writing is about, because the way they write essays back home is structured differently. It is not to say that it is structured badly, but we tend to equate different = bad in academia. Thinking of English use in terms of \"bad\" or \"good\" ignores whether it is effective or not; a different way of communicating the same idea does not inherently make it less effective.\n\nI've seen for my own eyes students who I think are plagiarising, and people who have absolute _no idea_ how to write an essay we expect out of American College students. This is true even for native speakers\n\nEvery country has a different type of \"English\". While admittedly, universities should not be passing people who cannot communicate effectively, expecting international students to have a full grasp of what academic English is the very moment they attend an university is perhaps a pipe dream.

", "aSentId": 50680, "answer": "As a rule i generally stop talking to someone who accuses me of being a troll...  But you seem nice enough so I'll answer your question.  A corporation has no right to restrain a country's ability to pass laws as they see fit.  A country however, in negotiations with other countries (as TIPP is) can agree to a treaty that binds both (or all in the case of TIPP) signatories.  This is a voluntary agreement that a country enters into which then imposes certain obligations, as agreed to in the treaty, on the country.\n\nIn this case a provisions of TIPP provides that countries are limited in what laws they can pass if those laws have an unfair impact on a foreign corporation trying to do business there.  The question of what is unfair is dealt with both in the treaty and by an impartial body the treaty sets up.  Yet this impartial body will make mistakes or their will be situations in which \"unfair\" treatment is important and warranted.\n\nIn such a case the country gets screwed for the benefit of a corporation.  I think this is bad.  And I think this is a direct result of the language in the agreement.  And i think this language is in this agreement because in the past left leaning governments have treated foreign corporations unfairly on ideological grounds.  Had countries always acted as honest brokers and passed laws that were prudent and fair I do not believe this kind of language would ever have been included.  And without this language countries would continue to be able to regulate prudently and fairly unrestrained.

Removing religion is the first step toward modernizing any nation. \n\nYou can pick ONE: \n\n* Religion or birth control -- larger families mean more desperate poor people who lack education and rely on religion\n\n* Religion or gender equality -- forcing women to stay in the home and birth lots of babies means half the adult population can't contribute to the economy. \n\n* Religion or economic growth -- women making ANY wage, much less equal wage, is the FIRST necessary step out of poverty, which means that availability of birth control is a gatekeeper factor in whether your country is going to be the third world or the first. \n\n* Religion or public health -- religions that treat birth control and sex ed as forbidden and wrong breed not just babies, but AIDS babies. STDs are uncontrollable without condoms, and every major world religion seems to be against safer sex. \n\n* Religion or funded education -- religious \"education\" (which determines that studying Scripture is the most important subject, which often fails to educate women alongside men, which often deliberately distorts facts and cripples the methods of rational inquiry) diverts desperately needed funds from real-world education. You can't get a rocket to the Moon by reading Scripture. You can't even learn to VALUE getting a rocket to the Moon from reading Scripture. It's an educational tautology, a dead end. \n\n* Religion or human rights -- Religions are amoral systems of collectivist social obedience. It doesn't matter who you are, or what you want, or how you were born, only that you obey and conform. This is in direct opposition to a modern understanding of how human beings function. Don't believe me? Ask literally any gay person living under religious rule. Oh, wait, don't, because if they admit they're gay, they'll be in big trouble!  \n\n* Religion or a functioning justice system -- interestingly, God's \"love\" is absent from religious justice systems. I strongly prefer secular, psychology- and science-based theories of criminal justice and social correction. An eye for an eye makes everyone blind. In the USA, we're trying to make progress in reforming and humanizing the legal system, but we're constantly hindered by right-wing religious conservatives who've applied a religious ontology (there are \"good people\" and \"bad people\" -- sheep and goats) to the legal system and therefore are caught up in a twisted rhetoric, being \"pro life\" and pro-death-penalty at the same time, trying preteens as adults, going insane trying to persecute \"vice\" crimes like drugs, and fighting the decriminalization of religious sexual offenses like prostitution. \n\n**TL;DR: Religion is actually a very reliable indicator of social distress and economic failure. Iran is an interesting case because the religion rules its people, but the Republican Guard rule the religion, and are actually a corporate interest (with the added power of law and violence) that doesn't care about religion at all.

Pipelines are relatively fragile, a few mortar shells or even machine gun fire could do some pretty serious damage, and wouldn't necessarily require getting that close. And while pipelines are generally easier to fix, certain areas are easier to disrupt than others. Pumping stations could be targets, for example, as could areas of the pipeling passing through difficult terrain, where the logistics of setting up a repair crew will be more difficult. Further, pipelines could also be vulnerable to things like cyberwarfare, where malicious code could be used to cause physical damage to pumping equipment or an explosion within the pipe itself.\n\n&gt;As for shipping, there's a myriad of threats, both overt and covert. The Chinese fleet has to pass through the Malacca Strait, which would be extremely easy to block with mines. And the route through the South China Sea brings the sea lanes within easy striking distance of Vietnam, Philippines and others. In any war in the South China Sea each ship would face threats from onshore anti ship missiles, naval or air attack, sea mines etc.\n\nThe problem is that all such attacks are easily attributable to Nation-States. If China goes to war with a state, and then all the sudden the Strait of Malacca is mined, you can probably guess who did it. While Chinese shipping may be easier to destroy for Vietnam than a Chinese pipeline, that isn't to say it would be easy. China has it's own navy, and while it can't challenge the U.S. outside it's own littoral zones, destroying the Vietnamese or Filipino navy should be relatively easy. Shipping could also be rerouted when it's just a regional war. Vietnam cannot target shipping coming in from the Makassar strait any more than they could target the pipeline. Also, while targeting a pipeline in Pakistan and Western China may be impossible for Vietnam or the Philippines, the same can't be said for the U.S. Even if Pakistan remained neutral in a hypothetical US-China conflict, it is unlikely that the U.S. wouldn't target the pipeline anyways. Defending against cruise missile strikes all along a 1800 mile pipeline would be very, very difficult if not impossible, and cruise missiles can also be launched at follow up repair crews or pumping stations.\n\n&gt;And it's not so hard to sink a ship with a submarine and deny it.. North Korea did it only a few years ago.\n\nThat was a political statement, and cannot be equated with attempting to economically strangle the second most powerful nation on the planet. Everyone also knew who did it at the time, but no one was willing to push the issue because there are 10000 pieces of artillery pointed at downtown Seoul. \n\nYou have some valid points about insurance and crew, some of which is was referring to in my above post, but unless the U.S. involved I think for increased premiums and maybe a bonus for the crew, shippers would be willing to run the risk of a \"blockade\" instituted by a Filipino or Vietnamese navy that will in all likelihood be busy trying to protect their own coasts.

Gravity is a consequence of the curvature of spacetime. Gravity is still a force, though. But rather than two bodies acting directly on one another (as in electromagnetism), what's actually happening is the bodies are acting upon spacetime itself. If you lay a grid on the rubber sheet and place something very heavy on it, the sheet is distorted, and so is the grid. On a flat sheet, a straight path is obvious to us, because we perceive space as flat. But on a sheet distorted by a heavy mass, you'd see some of the straight gridlines become circles around the distortion. Newton's laws still apply, though. An object in motion moves in a straight path unless affected by external forces. So if you place a heavy object on the sheet, and place another object nearby with some initial velocity, the second object will move in a straight line just like we expect--only the straight line is a circle from our vantage point. I'm having trouble explaining it, but the math works out this way.

The ultimate fate (or nature, given that another possible end is someone simply turning the simulation off) of the universe is really a \"your guess is as good as mine\" situation.", "aSentId": 53003, "answer": "Thank you for taking the time to respond and discuss all this with me.

Is it possible there is some form of anti-gravity at work in the empty areas?\n\nTo expand on what /u/horphop said:\n\nVoids like this one are *sort-of* predicted by the theory of gravity. In the most basic sense, gravity causes massive matter (massive just means \"having mass\") to clump together. If you have a layer of sand on a table, and then you start sweeping areas of sand into piles, you end up with tiny areas of very high density (eg, stars) and some areas of very low density (like, a handful of grains of sand in a square foot of space--these are your voids). The layer of sand didn't start out uniform, which leads to all sorts of odd features.\n\nThe role dark matter plays is this:\n\nSuppose you're measuring the height of a plant (that never stops growing) for years and years and years. You observe that it grows 3in one year, and then shrinks 1in the next year, and then grows 3in, back and forth. But when you take everything you know about how plants grow and try to model the plant mathematically, you get a linear plot showing nonstop growth. You have no idea what's causing the plant's height to oscillate, and not for lack of trying--you can't find any evidence whatsoever that the plant should behave this way, but it does. However, you find that if you do something funky with your mathematical model, like add an invisible second plant attached to the first one, the model fits your observations. You call the invisible second plant \"dark plant\" and call it a day. (Just kidding, you spend the rest of your life looking for evidence of the dark plant and probably die without finding it.)", "aSentId": 53007, "answer": "I laughed at this, possibly too much.

For most of China's history (up until just recently) there was constant in fighting / revolution / war / land grabs / more war (and on and on for centuries). So just for a start Chinese internal unity and cohesiveness is very far from a guarantee, the last 30 years have been an exception from the rule, not (at all) the rule.\n\nNext demography, China's 1 child policy was in a sense rigging the economy for high speed growth. People not using their money to raise children means more money for consumption and saving which helps the economy to grow very quickly. But there's a problem, in a society without a very developed welfare system there is a long history of children taking care of the elderly. And now you should be able to see the problem, China has a huge population bulge followed by an incredibly steep population collapse. As the population collapse strikes capital will dry up, the workers will be expected to care for their parents, and their grandparents leaving little money for consumption. It is also unlikely that these over stressed and over worked people will have time to raise their own children leading to a sustained population decline. \n\nFinally the finance part of the equation. Chinese people do not invest their money like people in other countries might. In China workers put their money into one of the **national** banks, there is no where else for them to put their money.\n\nSince national banks are the only option there is no need to offer a competitive interest rates to draw customers. You put your money in the bank and get very little interest, or you put it under your mattress and get no interest.\n\nThe national banks then lend out their money to Chinese businesses, these businesses are often national entities themselves, they are at very least approved of by the communist party. If your business is not an approved business then you cannot receive loans from China's national banks.\n\nBut if you're one of the lucky companies that does receive loans you can get **a lot** of money, with very little oversight, and very low interest payments.\n\nThis is the money (capital) which has been used to build millions of miles of new roads, new bullet trains, new cities, airports, universities, malls, the list goes on and on and on.\n\nWhich is great, right?\n\nWell yes and no, you know the old expression \"if you build it they will come\"? Well there's another part to that expression that many people forget, \"if you build it they will come, **if** they can afford it\".\n\nChina has been building infrastructure up the wazoo with the expectation that China will become the next great consumer economy. That there will be **customers** and users for all of this brand new infrastructure.\n\nBut there's a big problem, these consumers don't actually exist, not yet and maybe (probably) never. The average income of a Chinese household is 1/8th that of an American (also median income). Which means that all of the malls, cities, apartments, roads they've built **have no customers**.\n\nNo customers means no return on investment (the peoples investment). Inability to constantly get new loans from government banks means default. Default means that you wont pay back the investment and that investment again comes from every day Chinese people who are now not going to get their money back.\n\nChina has been charging through a period of massive, government subsidized growth which has led to an explosively growing GDP, which is great. But the problem is there is a bubble a huge bubble, in more or less every single sector of the Chinese economy.\n\nThat bubble will pop, (stories like this are the beginning of that pop), when that bubble pops millions of very poor Chinese people will realize that a huge portion of their savings are gone, that their house has suddenly depreciated, then many more will realize their job is gone. \n\nWhich brings us full circle back to point one, national unity. The United States goes through booms and busts frequently. It sucks but we figure it out and there are no huge problems because were one unified country. This is not so true in China where fully half of the population lives in the very poor interior. An economic collapse in China may very well lead to a societal collapse.\n\nSo while you might see China allowing certain companies to default as an indicator of progress. I see cracks in the facade of indomitable growth, and when China experiences its first severe bust after some 3 decades of breakneck growth I find the social implications of that to be very scary.\n", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13", "qSentId": 54655, "question": "Not really it's only \"good news\" if you believe this is some sort of indicator that China is moving towards a more free market system than its had in the past. \n\nIt's bad news (and very very scary) if you understand the mechanism behind China's consistent annual GDP growth for the past 3 decades.\n\nThere are three big factors to understand:\n\n1) National unity\n\n2) Demography\n\n3) Financing\n\nFirst unity, if you take a quick glance at Chinese history you'll understand that unity and peace is only a recent development.

For most of China's history (up until just recently) there was constant in fighting / revolution / war / land grabs / more war (and on and on for centuries). So just for a start Chinese internal unity and cohesiveness is very far from a guarantee, the last 30 years have been an exception from the rule, not (at all) the rule.\n\nNext demography, China's 1 child policy was in a sense rigging the economy for high speed growth. People not using their money to raise children means more money for consumption and saving which helps the economy to grow very quickly. But there's a problem, in a society without a very developed welfare system there is a long history of children taking care of the elderly. And now you should be able to see the problem, China has a huge population bulge followed by an incredibly steep population collapse. As the population collapse strikes capital will dry up, the workers will be expected to care for their parents, and their grandparents leaving little money for consumption. It is also unlikely that these over stressed and over worked people will have time to raise their own children leading to a sustained population decline. \n\nFinally the finance part of the equation. Chinese people do not invest their money like people in other countries might. In China workers put their money into one of the **national** banks, there is no where else for them to put their money.\n\nSince national banks are the only option there is no need to offer a competitive interest rates to draw customers. You put your money in the bank and get very little interest, or you put it under your mattress and get no interest.\n\nThe national banks then lend out their money to Chinese businesses, these businesses are often national entities themselves, they are at very least approved of by the communist party.
