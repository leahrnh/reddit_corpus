You quickly run through all the locations and find the smallest and largest X locations.  X-large - X small is the size of the range of locations.  Divide that distance up by N+1.  The pigeonhole priniciple says that since there are N cars, and N+1 divisions, no matter how evenly the cars are distributed, there is at least one of those divisions that will not contain a car.\n\n\nSo, now, create a boolean array of N+1, which we will call the Piece of Road array, and each element in the array represents a chunk of road from position i/N+1(Xlarge-xsmall).   For each car, given an X value, divide the X over the XLarge to figure out which array element contains the car. (you calculate the array index with a division) Mark that array element as taken.   \nWhen you are done, at least one element will not be marked.  We know that the gap is at least as wide as range of locations over N+1.\n\n\nOkay, but that might not be the biggest gap.   We can use the basic algorithm above and we could extend it this way.  Have in each array element a max and min variable (or lfirst and last))  These values (if assigned) will mark the first car inside that PieceOfRoad, and the last car inside that piece of road.   For each car X, when we figure out which piece of road array element it belongs to, mark the element as having a car and min its x location with the array elements min, and max the Car's X with the Array' elements Max variable.  \n\nWhat you are doing is storing only the first (min) and last (max) car locations in the piece of road element.  The idea is that the largest gap will include a portion of two or more adjoining piece of road array elements,  The largest gap will not be WITHIN any of the array elements, but stretched across the boundaries.  \n\nSo, to find the largest gap.  Start with the last car (max) inside the first element of the array, there is a gap between it and the first (min) of the next element in the array.

The quantum algorithms that have been discovered were worked out under the assumption that coherence could be kept. I think the main barrier in QC is the difficulty in keeping a coherent state. If that can be done, there are still some other issues, but that is the big one.\n\n&gt;I realize that you have to be able to know the coherence in order to fix it and be 100% sure you fixed it. However is there a possible way in which was could know such a thing to prevent decoherence?\n\nThat's the thing... you can't \"know the coherence in order to fix it\". If a qubit is measured, it loses coherence. If you learn almost anything interesting about the state, you lose coherence. So the issue is that you can't \"fix\" decoherence; you must prevent it. Unfortunately, interacting with any large or random system will cause decoherence.\n\nSo imagine that you have a qubit that is somehow stored in an atom. Maybe the qubit is the atom's spin. Well, something is holding that atom in place. It is on some substrate. Unfortunately that substrate has a lot of atoms and most likely they are all interacting to a certain extent. That causes decoherence. You can think of it as a random error in the qubit that comes from interacting with the environment. But if you measure the qubit to find out what that error is, then you have changed the state of the qubit and that may have destroyed the computation you were trying to perform.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qhmr", "qSentId": 52597, "question": "Looking for arrays of positive integers", "aSentId": 52598, "answer": "I'm not sure I understand your question, exactly.
