If you cast (type assert) interface{} to the wrong type, your program stops and tells you where the error is.  If you cast void\\* to the wrong type, your program blithely continues with wrong data, which is at best an annoying segfault, and at worst a remote code execution exploit.  The difference is that interface{} contains a runtime representation of the type.  The thing interface{} is _actually_ closest to is Java's Object -- a type with methods plus a value of that type.

The \"save as\" dialog is gone, the \"save\" dialog now shows a delete button even if something was not saved to the file system ever. Too many times I accidentally overwrote a file in keynote or preview because my knowledge of how a file system works, does not apply to how the UI maps the application operations to what it's doing.\n\nFor someone who has internalized the traditional Save model and whose muscle memory is based on that, it's entirely understandable that the new model would be frustrating and feel unnatural. There are a number of things going on here, but for my purposes I think it suffices to only really talk about one; The changes are not just UI changes; the way files are used actually has changed and your mental model for how an application uses files is no longer accurate for these programs. The frustration you feel is not because the new model is hiding how things actually work, it's because how things actually work is different from what you're used to.\n\nFor example, when you say \"even if something was not saved to the file system ever,\" you are almost certainly incorrect that the file hasn't been written. Even though you didn't select a location or choose a name, the application almost always has written your document to disk somewhere. You can quit the application, restart the computer, and when you come back that document will still be there, because it _was_ persisted.\n\nThe new Save model isn't trying to hide what's 'really' going on so much as it is is an attempt to change what's really going on so that it fits a simpler mental model for users. I happen to like the new mental model, but the change does present a challenge for users used to the old model and workflows based on it.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2fwo","qSentId": 53324,"question": "This pretty much mirrors my experience with git.
