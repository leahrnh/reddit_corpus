I want to add that there are things that are found in nature that are beneficial to humans, can help cure ailments, and alleviate all kinds of symptoms just as effectively as drugs. However, homeopathy by definition excludes all of these things.

Most of the time with homeopathy the bogus non existent active ingredient has no medical benefits anyway.\r\rSo basically in your specific case you outgrew the asthma.

Homeopathic remedies are developed as follows:  find out what symptoms the patient you wish to treat has, and find an herb or substance that causes those same symptoms.  Add this substance to a vial of water, and shake the water 10 times front to back, 10 times side-to-side, and 10 times up-and-down.  Next, dilute that water mixture by a factor of one-hundred with more water, and repeat the  shaking.  Continue doing this 10 or more times - the more dilute with water, the *stronger* the supposed remedy is.  By the time most homeopathic remedies are \"ready\" the amount of active ingredient in the final solution is best measured in parts-per-*lightyear*, but that's OK according to homeopaths because you want the water with the \"memory\" (ignoring for a moment that there's no such thing, and if there is the water has somehow forgotten all the fish poop it's had in it), not the original ingredient.\n\nWhy doesn't this work?\n\nA.)  there's no evidence that water has a \"memory\"  \nB.)  if water does have a memory, there's no telling what else would be at the same concentrations, and no explanation of a mechanism for said memory  \nC.)

We can all find exactly the answers we're looking for... and that's a problem, because usually the answers are not one but four, five or six. But then we find the one answer that matches our preconceived notions and we latch on to it, and while it's not the \"wrong\" answer necessarily it's not the only answer.\n\n3. Mob rule. We all know it, but we just call it by the euphemism \"hive mind.\" In some ways its much worse than we imagine because of the anonymity of the internet.

For example highways maintained using federal funds in surrounding states benefits Connecticut's economy. Or for example money spent on Iowa corn ensures cheap prices in Connecticut's super markets. Or for example money spent on NOAA stations in other states helps Connecticut receive up to date meteorological information. Or for example spending that other states gets from the FAA helps Connecticut's air traffic control function more efficiently.

Or for example CDC spending in Georgia helps ensure people in Connecticut stay healthy. Or for example the space program which is based in other states; Connecticut certainly receives an economic benefit from the GPS satellite system. Foreign policy is handled by the state department which does not run operations through Connecticut directly, but its functions certainly give economic benefits to the state. \n\n\n Most importantly take the example of how Ohio receives money to construct an M1 tank. The company of which is headquartered in Virginia. Kentucky then gets money from Fort Knox where M1 crews are trained. Other states then get money to operate bases where the tanks are stored. This doesn't just work for tanks, but with weapons, aircraft, aircraft carriers, and nuclear weapons. Connecticut gets the benefit of existing under the most powerful military on the planet the monetary benefit of which is hard to determine and compare to what is taxed out of the state when you consider that this military force has created a world system of \"Pax America\" where America, and in part Connecticut, plays the role of global hegemon. \n\n\nConnecticut is certainly in a somewhat envious position that Greece, being part of a more decentralized EU, does not get to have.

If that is not good enough for you it also doesn't have a serious impact on the persons ability to do much of anything and has been shown to reduce UTI's in infants (this alone is hardly a good reason for doing it).\n\nIn general there are real benefits associated with circumcision, the primary reason people started electing to do it as a child is that it is SIGNIFICANTLY easier and faster recovery times as an infant as compared to adulthood after the genitals have fully developed, so if a person was going to have it done regardless getting it done as an infant makes the most sense.\n\nFGM on the other hand serves ZERO medical purpose.  It is not recognized as a treatment for any known medical issues, nor is it even a standardized procedure in and of itself.  \nFGM can remove any and potentially all of the following, the clitoral hood, the clitoris itself, the labia minora and majora, stitching the opening of the vagina mostly shut, intentional scarification of the vaginal opening, slicing of the vaginal opening with temporary stitches to help it \"grow together\", and a whole host of horror stories from botched FGM \"procedures\".\n\nCampaign against elective infancy circumcision all you want, but don't lump FGM in there with it.

Your politicians really don't lie or make false promises?", "aSentId": 42886, "answer": "First there is the referendum. If a law is voted by the parliament the people still has the opportunity to vote against it. First we gather signatures and then the whole population is called to the voting booth. The main advantage is that no party can go berserk and put to vote stupid or extreme laws, even if they have a strong majority. They would be stopped by the people, so they don't do it. It has a very strong preemptive effect on the global political environment, that's the key point. Each party wants to avoid being stopped by a referendum, so they have to discuss with other party and balance their text. That's the reason why no politician can make any promise during a campaign: the people could break it by a referendum. So as a campaign they just declare their global political orientation and their opinion on different subjects and we vote for them based on this. They cannot cheat and lying is pointless. Messing up for a swiss politician is not being able to complete his projects, not being able to assemble a majority with other party on their specific projects, not being able to promote their ideas, usually by being able to make compromise with political opponents. In this case it's usually their party which ask them politely to leave their seat for someone with better negotiation skills.\n  \n  \nSecond there is the initiative: the people can propose a new law and force it by a vote. If there are enough signatures and vote for the text then the government can only accept the new text as it is. That's another reason why swiss politicians make no promise, because if the swiss people really wants something (ex: health care law Obama style) we just use the initiative and vote the law by ourselves. We don't wait for a politician to do it. Usually if something is really needed the parliament will do the job since no politician wants to deal with a law voted by the people. They have their plans and it would be a problem for them to deal with such text. So if forces them to act if they feel something is needed by the people. If an initiative is proposed and has a chance of success then the government will propose a similar text, usually lighter (counter project) and the people decides between the two propositions. In the end the swiss politicians are pushed by the initiative but slowed down by the referendum. Which makes the job unattractive for really ambitious people.
