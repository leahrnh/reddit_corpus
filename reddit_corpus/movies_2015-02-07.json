They don't do \"just ok.\"  They do brilliant or train wrecks, regardless of expectation.  \n\nFirst of all, just about everything they do/did carries/carried high expectations (perhaps not going forward anymore).  They make daring films with daring decisions.  Speed Racer had high expectations and was a train wreck in my opinion.\n\nBy comparison -- in terms of genre, feel, expectation -- Tron Legacy was \"just OK.\"  Both Tron Legacy and Speed Racer were huge nostalgia films, both relied on heavy visuals, but Tron Legacy was a safe and forgettable movie while Speed Racer was an at-times gorgeous but overall disaster of a film, in my opinion.\n\nBasically, Wachowskis won't make films that make you go \"meh.\"  Matrix Revolutions was repulsive, The Matrix was revelatory.   I thought Reloaded was as close to \"just OK\" as possible, but I still thought it was amazing by normal standards.  All 3 movies made HUGE, HUGE daring and unconventional filming/story decisions, as the pros and cons are pretty much all focused on the writing and not the visuals, acting, or directing.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3s","qSentId": 269,"question": "I'd describe it as \"Wachowski\".

As for the plot, well, yeah, a bit simplistic i must admit but it is acceptable - bits of deus ex machina sometimes tough and bits of exposition there and there-, i won't dwell on the extremly forced love story as it is a bit of hollywood standard now (IMO it is as much forced as Trinity in the first matrix loving Neo just because someone told her to do it...). A bit disapointed the end of the movie doesn't offer much resolution tough.

You can really see them pulling back from the graphic violence and adding humor to make it more accessible for teens who generally don't enjoy sci-fi films.  Yes the jokes often fall flat, or come from a direction we haven't seen before.\n\nHowever, in all of this there is originality and intense care to detail.  The world-building is fantastic and on a scale that far exceeds recent comparisons.  There is a strong Dune influence in the representation of family dynasties/political motivations, but the Wachowski's intense visual style differentiate it enough to keep it fresh and hint at a bigger universe.  There is a commitment to concept that has been commented on here as growing old or comical as the film progresses, but I would disagree.  You never feel as though the characters are not using all of their abilities to survive these situations.  I admire them for not revealing a 'secret weapon'.  The technology in the film is unified in look and utility.  All the ships have distinct characteristics apart from scale, but you can see mirrored concept through each grander iteration.  The cathedral-like ships are beautifully imagined, and cleverly utilized for the wedding scene.  The initial chase sequence with the hunters is a visual treat, cameras jumping underneath Caine's feet both in air and through glass.  The minion hunters are something straight out of anime and look the part.  Every time one of those massive ships bursts through some space-phenomenon it is equally breathtaking.

The final sequence with her and Redmayne is fantastic, it feels brutal and the hits sell.  Redmayne is the tricky one.  It's hard to tell whether or not there were parts cut from throughout his dialogue.  He is truly an operatic villain, chewing scenery and whispering threats.  The physicality of his performance was great though, the stiffness and mannerisms consistent throughout.  Sean Bean didn't die, and gave a solid one-note performance as an old soldier.

I grew up on goofy, schlocky fantasy and scifi books and movies and comics (some of which are now classics), and I was absolutely thrilled to see another one in theaters.

If anything, they inject *too much* soul into their movies for mainstream tastes, as it can easily be read as cheesy or hokey.

It's refreshing to have mega-budget movies that don't feel like they're made to squeeze every penny out of audiences that will feel obligated to see every movie and spinoff and TV show set in the universe. They tell grand, cosmic stories about how in the big scheme of things, we're all just people, all in it together, just slight variations of the same genes, all just trying to get by and maybe make a difference in the world. Sure, it's maybe not a *super* insightful, original message, but to me (especially considering Lana being transgender) it comes across as truly from the heart and completely optimistic and earnest.

Me and some friends saw it stoned and had a blast ripping apart the movie afterwards.\n\nSpoilers ahead\n\n* Opening scene, Jupiter's father is murdered by a group of men who steal a golden telescope from him. You never hear about these men again and the telescope is never seen again. *(Jupiter wants to buy one off eBay later but there's no reason given to believe it to be the same one)*\n* There is no significance at all to the character Jupiter's name, other than her father having a huge boner for the planet.\n* Channing Tatum's character has these anti-gravity boots that let him skate around in the air. He explains them, I shit you not, as letting him \"ride differential equations\".\n* In the first half of the movie, there is a big fight scene in Chicago. About halfway through the scene, my friends and I all started looking around at each other to make sure we weren't just blazed and that this scene was really going on this long. I wasn't timing it, but I'd wager it was 10-15 minutes of straight action shots with little to no dialogue. \n* ROYALTY SENSING BEES.\n* Channing Tatum's character's whole background story is that he's spliced with wolf DNA or something and that he lost his job because he mauled someone once. They keep bringing this up as a reason not for Jupiter not to trust him. It is mentioned repeatedly. This is never relevant, and he never bites anyone in the movie, not even when he GETS INTO A FIGHT WHERE SOMEONE ELSE BITES HIM\n* Additionally, Channing Tatum spends 90% of his screen time rescuing Mila Kunis from falling. \n* Mila Kunis talked in her AMA about how Jupiter is a strong character and does a lot of her own fighting... I don't know if she watched the movie she's in, but she beats one guy with a pipe once and spends every other action scene falling so that Channing Tatum can catch her.\n* Notice that I never refer to Channing Tatum's character by his name? I can't remember it, and I saw the movie an hour ago.\n* There was one scene where an unimportant character coughs in the middle of her line. She just continues her sentence and everyone carries on. Like... why did she cough? Could they not have done another take? Was she *supposed* to cough? It didn't have any relevance, she was a one line character and she fucked it up.\n* There are a few CGI aliens in the movie. Mostly a race of dragon looking dudes with wings, who are used repeatedly throughout as henchmen by the bad guys. But there is this one tusked elephant looking alien that has about 4 seconds of total screen time. He is clearly a different type of alien than any of the other characters in the movie, he looks completely different. Yet they felt his 4 seconds of screen time important enough to devote the time and effort into modeling, animating and rendering this random unique alien!?\n\nI'm definitely leaving out a lot. Almost every scene in this movie had it's own unique twist of crazy and illogical choices by the people who created it.
