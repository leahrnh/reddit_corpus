If you can gain access to that device by catching an error they make in access the internet to post on twitter you might be able to use that device to gather more intel.\n\nSo the same phone they post to twitter also has a separate text message with the GPS coordinate of an ISIS location.

They do have much deeper connections and information than that which is easily accessible by the public. However, derailing the propaganda and recruitment machine is an important aspect that I feel gets overlooked. Sure its only a thin skin of a much deeper organism, but it is what potential recruits and the rest of the world is most familiar with and has the most access to. I would bet that the inroads that the CIA and other organizations have through twitter and other social media are dwarfed by other methods of intelligence gathering. If everything relied on social media there would be way too much potential for misinformation and deception. The vast majority of actionable intelligence does not come from these surface level accounts and though it might be a temporary setback in some ways, they likely are able to get access to the new accounts that will be created within quite a small time frame. They have access to virtually any data center and communication link around the world. My point is that the anonymous hack does more good than harm and does not set back true military intelligence much if at all. If anything it can put ISIS into a scramble setting up new accounts and potentially revealing even more connections and information as they try to get the recruitment and propaganda network back in place. I am by no means an expert but to me making the organization look less credible, less professional and less of a challenge to the US on a public level will hurt not only their reputation but potential recruitment and sympathetic feelings in the region.

Sure its only a thin skin of a much deeper organism, but it is what potential recruits and the rest of the world is most familiar with and has the most access to. I would bet that the inroads that the CIA and other organizations have through twitter and other social media are dwarfed by other methods of intelligence gathering. If everything relied on social media there would be way too much potential for misinformation and deception. The vast majority of actionable intelligence does not come from these surface level accounts and though it might be a temporary setback in some ways, they likely are able to get access to the new accounts that will be created within quite a small time frame. They have access to virtually any data center and communication link around the world. My point is that the anonymous hack does more good than harm and does not set back true military intelligence much if at all. If anything it can put ISIS into a scramble setting up new accounts and potentially revealing even more connections and information as they try to get the recruitment and propaganda network back in place. I am by no means an expert but to me making the organization look less credible, less professional and less of a challenge to the US on a public level will hurt not only their reputation but potential recruitment and sympathetic feelings in the region. Portraying them as incompetent and unable to handle simple social media accounts speaks volumes for what they may be able to do(or in this case, not do) if they did form their own country or state. Undermining any perceived credibility or authority they have goes a long way in the long run.","aSentId": 33813,"answer": "You kind of missed my point, the social media is an access point to devices that are used for other things.\n\nEven having the intact propaganda and recruitment machine is valuable. Now they will re-structure, and put in new security measures, whereas they thought they were secure before.\n\nI don't think anyone in this thread knows enough to say if this will be overall good or bad. I'm just saying that often times with things like this there is a reason the powers that be didn't just hit them. The US gov. can certainly do anything anonymous can so I have to assume that they decided not to for a reason and that maybe this wasn't such a good thing. Let's be honest, Facebook, twitter, and emails likely were broken by anonymous through fishing attacks. If they had the ability to circumvent those places security another way I think we would be seeing a lot more activity from them. That's not a super sophisticated way to gain access to an account, especially from people who likely aren't as familiar with those things as first world citizens are. That being the case I'm sure the US Gov. needs only show Facebook proof that an account has terrorist ties to have it removed and handed over. the US gov. wouldn't have had to hack anything if they had wanted those accounts down, which leads me to believe they didn't.

House of Cards is like a preschoolers view of political corruption, especially the American version. For one, for Underwoods schemes to work as well as they do, everyone else has to be a moron. For two, it's way too blatant. Real political corruption is much more subtle, much harder to root out. \n\nReal corruption is more like, you are a young would be politician. You've got a degree in law or poli sci or something like that, you've volunteered on campaigns, maybe worked for elected officials. You have your views and are trying to get your name out there. Someone, maybe it's a friend from school who made it big in the private sector, offers you support, so you take it. They connect you to others in the private sector who can support you, whose support you need to get your name out. Note this isn't money changing hands necessarily, nor is it a quid pro quo exchange, it's networking and all seemingly innocent. Your friend and his friends helping you get elected, probably because you agree on some issues. Anyway, you get elected, and a law comes up regarding the industry your friend works in. So you ask his opinion, he's the expert not you. And he tells you his opinion, and the opinion of his friends. And you believe it, because he's your friend and he was a big part of putting you where you are and he's done well in that area so he clearly knows what he's talking about, right? \n\nIt's a combination of the monetary cost of running a modern campaign with peoples tendency to trust their friends over scientifically analyzed data. There's more blatant corruption, but I honestly think it's far less dangerous than people simply trusting their friends and allies over objective fact.

Good luck with that.\n\nEdit: To be more specific, the problem with enforcing copyright legislation is that the main violator is the cuban government itself who routinely passes american movies in public television without paying anything to anyone. So before any copyright agreement can be made between the two countries so that people selling \"The Package\" can be persecuted, the cuban government would have to agree to not infringe itself those agreements.

For instance, there was some news coverage a while back about outbreaks of syphillis in some high schools in affluent areas of Texas, based on the understanding that oral sex presents a lower risk of transmitting STDs. In a different vein, there have been outbreaks of opiate addiction because some teenagers felt that snorting heroin was less risky than shooting heroin. There's a grain of truth in both of those ideas, of course. But these kinds of things illustrate how difficult it is to predict how people will behave in the context of reduced risk. They also illustrate how outbreaks can happen on a local, community level that might not be characteristic of the population as a whole or picked up in any given research study. \n\nTo speculate, I imagine that if we gave teenagers a magical injection that (1) prevented all unwanted pregnancy and (2) prevented the transmission of all STDs except, let's say, syphillis, that the incidence of syphillis would rise. In the case of the HPV vaccine, many of the vaccine recipients were probably being educated about HPV for the first time. It's possible that, because HPV isn't on their radar prior to being vaccinated, receiving the vaccine is very unlikely to change the level of their risk-taking behavior. That is, both before and after receiving the vaccine, they would be more concerned about the transmission of STDs other than HPV. After all, the long term risk of developing a relatively treatable form of cancer is not exactly the most burning issue when it comes to STDs in the minds of most people. \n\nThe other interesting thing is that HPV is a great candidate for vaccination. That is, universal vaccination would be pretty effective even in the absence of any education about what it is, because standard safe sex practices will work to reduce transmission as well.

For example, having sex 3 times with a condom is safer than 2 times without a condom.  Even though the behavior went up 50%, the safety used was so great it didn't matter.\n\n2.  Would a vaccine taken years ago result in more risky behavior to begin with?  Unlike seat belts which are right there, a vaccine is long ago and largely forgotten about.\n\ntl;dr - This could have been a legitimately interesting question if people weren't using it to push 'sex is bad' agendas.

If the economy is defined as GDP, then perhaps this is right. But economists use GDP as a measure of the value of the goods and services produced.

It's also a poor measure of value because it counts the desires of a rich person much more than the desires of a poor person, since they are willing to pay more money for goods and services that they don't care much about.\n\nIt's obviously extremely difficult to measure the actual economic value of the goods and services produced in an economy, which is why most governments and economists don't even bother attempting to do this.\n\nHowever, it's plausible that a democracy is better able to produce the goods and services that people actually want and need than an authoritarian government that maximizes GDP.

In the early 2000s China was *already* a major player in manufacturing, even though they might have been in the same position as us; \n2. They had already taken major steps to combat the logistical problems of their massive population, namely the one child policy. \n3. By the early 2000s they had had an entire generation all grown up who knew nothing except the days of a government with absolute power, one that got things done ruthlessly. The people fell in line with this. \n\nEssentially, by the late 90s/early 2000s, the Chinese government had already set in motion the policies and practices that have resulted in its current status as emergent superpower. This is in stark contrast to the Indian government, which for the most part, has thrived so far on appeasement policies designed to keep themselves in power and to keep the country polarized. \n\nTL:DR Cautious optimism is usually the best way to deal with our country and '21st century will be the Indian century!' really flies in the face of that because it's not grounded. \n\n(If I made factual errors anywhere please correct me)","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13","qSentId": 39047,"question": "&gt; Indian here\n\nThat doesn't magically give you more knowledge about the issue","aSentId": 39064,"answer": "Jokes on us.

","aSentId": 40436,"answer": "Well, that's quite the insult, clearly you're a sophisticate. Nonetheless, in lieu of u/LaoSh I'll try and explain. \n\nThe West is built on secular ideals in which no religion is treated differently from any other religion. This is a basis of multiculturalism, which is also a fundamental part of modern Western society. If your religion says \"Event X must never happen,\" but every other religion is fine with it, then when Event X happens and there is an uproar that is an instance of your religion wanting to be treated differently. So that causes a contradiction with the premise that no religion is treated differently from any other religion, and is widely seen as backwards, un-modern, uncivilised, etc.\n\nYou may argue that in the previous example Event X is a fundamental thing that everyone would be insulted by: anyone would take offense at someone making fun of their principal religious figure. But here's the thing: everyone *doesn't* take offense at it. Making fun of a religious figure happens *all the time* in Western society. It's part of the cultural fabric of the West. Just to take Christianity as an example, there is a somewhat famous artwork called Piss Christ which is just a crucifix in a jar of urine. The whole point of that piece of art is to blaspheme. It's meant to be thought-provoking, making the audience question *why* such a banal thing should be offensive, etc. Another example is the arguably more famous movie Life of Brian, which is a straight mockery of the Jesus Story. Etc. \n\nWhile not every Christian is ok with these things, there aren't wide-spread movements that get thousands of people to protest blasphemy (though to be fair there are small groups of people who do protest, especially in the USA). This is in part because people don't care, since religion is not a defining trait of people as much as it used to be, and the vast majority of individuals in the West are secular.\n\nWhen people in the Muslim community protest en masse against Charlie Hebdo, they are essentially saying \"we do not belong in Western society, our ideals clash with the fundamental ideals of this culture.\" Which is quite rich, considering the freedom and prosperity that Western society affords those who are a part of it, and is quite false, because while that group of people might have huge problems with it, secular Muslims would not give two shits. But nobody ever hears from those Muslims, because they're busy going to their jobs and taking care of their families.\n\nPart of participating in modern society involves adopting secular multicultural ideals. These ideals aren't meant to be oppressive, and nobody would (or should) stop you from praying at Mosque or participating in your religious community. They do, however, stop you from trying to impose your values on others. You may find it unfair, and say that Western society is trying to impose *its* values on you, but all it's doing is treating you fairly, like it treats every other group. If you don't like it, then you think your group is special, and are violating the premise that no religion should be treated differently from any other religion.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13","qSentId": 40425,"question": "Actually if you did some research, Christians do blow up things (Even in the US, including abortion clinics) and bombs that have killed over 100 people, including children, but okay.

The whole concept of bankruptcy was invented to deal with situations exactly like Greece.  Greece has not been improving since they went into debt.  The debt has been growing as has the debt service.  People who think they should have a firesale of natural resources just to be able to service the debt and go deeper into the hole are completely devoid of reality.","aSentId": 42245,"answer": "You have to understand greece is now like a state in the US.

Just defaulting your currency wouldn't bring back the good old days of living on loaned money.

In other words, the have enough money for all their actual spending, and then some. They only need to borrow money to pay off old loans. So if they defaulted (or simply redenominated the debt in drachma and inflated it away) they wouldn't need any new borrowing.\n\nSecond, the primary advantage of de-Euroification wouldn't be debt-related. The EU is not an optimal currency area because it doesn't have an integrated economy like the US does. In a normal economy, if business slows the central bank injects more money into the economy to stimulate commerce; but in Greece, they have the same currency as the rest of the Eurozone and in 2007, the rest of the Eurozone was more worried about inflation. In a normal economy, if your imports are growing and exports falling, that automatically puts pressure on your currency, and once your currency weakens a bit, your industries start to look more efficient and they revive; but in Greece, no one who gets paid Euros by Greeks ever needs to use those Euros in Greece, so instead of stimulating industry, the current account deficit stifles Greek commerce. As soon as Greece has their own currency the economic system will see benefits of devaluation, unless the Eurozone is willing to subsidize Greece in order to keep them in.\n\nThird, as others have noted, international lenders are sharks, not ideologues, and as soon as a country defaults they tend not to think \"oooh you nasty villains\", but \"wow, the fundamentals on this country look really good now.\" Historically some defaults (where there was a primary deficit) have killed \u00e0 country's credit, others (where there was a primary surplus and a huge debt overhang) help it.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13","qSentId": 42195,"question": "It wouldn't change much for the Greek people themselves, because their country would still have no way to get loans - which in turn means the austerity they so much hate would be their burden for the foreseeable future.\n\nWhat many people tend to ignore is, that austerity first and foremost resulted in reduced social welfare, more taxes and less civil servants.

So, Germany's debts were forgiven, even though they destroyed most of Europe and certainly owed most of Europe huge sums of money.  On the other hand, Germany needs to realize that because its debts were forgiven to keep the peace in Europe, Greece's debts could also be forgiven (or restructured) to prevent the collapse of the Eurozone.  If Germany doesn't become more lenient with the people who owe it money, it will be doing exactly what the Allies did to Germany during the Treaty of Versailles.

The German power structure seemed to believe that if they just slaughtered Slavs and Jews that everyone would let them get away with it. \n\nUnfortunately for them,they then decided to attack Belgium and France, and the British did not back down. Consequently, there was a world war. \n\nIt's kinda sad, reading how certain Hitler is that the British will recognize the inherent rightness of his plans, when what he means is brutal ethnic cleansing and the destruction of all the non-German countries to the east. His line of reasoning is that the anglo states have already done this in the Americas, Africa, and Asia, and that surely the leadership will understand that Germany must do the same thing in order to be a world empire. \n\nAnyway, worth reading the words of the Germans themselves, because it paints a picture that is never addressed in the west. Hitler believed himself following the British and American examples, and thought (even as the war raged) that it was a misunderstanding and surely the Anglo states would see that and withdraw. It takes until maybe 1942 for that view to drop out of his letters. ","aSentId": 42916,"answer": "Well said!  Hilter admired the British.

Also, since the end of World War II house prices always went up, and that was the assumption going forward with these laws.
