Those two things are considered supplememts when it's just food in a different form. I use Tryptophan too which can be derived from food but I need a little more due to a malabsorption issue.

Children are not ready to carry pregnancies, even young teens have very high risk pregnancies because the pelvis has not developed fully. \n\n\"Childbirth is more likely to be difficult and dangerous for an adolescent than for an adult. Babies born to very young mothers are much more likely to die in the first year of life. Young adolescents do not yet have a fully developed pelvis. Pregnancy for them can result in serious consequences, such as eclampsia, premature labour, prolonged labour, obstructed labour, fistula, anaemia (thin blood) or infant and/or maternal death.\nThe younger the mother is, the greater the risk to her and her baby. The risk of maternal death related to pregnancy and childbirth for adolescent girls between 15 and 19 years of age accounts for some 70,000 deaths each year. For adolescents under 15 years of age these risks increase substantially. Girls who give birth before age 15 are five times more likely to die in childbirth than women in their twenties.\"\n\nPeople used to believe the world was flat too, just because people in the past believed something was \"right\" doesn't mean that it is biologically normal.\n\n","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13","qSentId": 41759,"question": "Define backward though.\n\nBiologically speaking it's normal, though in our Western society it has become abnormal (which I agree with, halt the accusations).","aSentId": 41762,"answer": "Stagnation is the least normal thing possible.

It's also funny when people of these minorities instantly blame any call to limit migration racist although in this case, it would be more targeted for national security, and a country's natives should be able to choose who they let in anyway. They probably want mass migration until they get a sizeable minority or until there's been enough migration and birthrates for them to become majority, and if you said you wanted thousands of your own non middle eastern based race to move to their homeland, they wouldn't allow that (they would probably call it a crusade), which just shows a lot of them are all for one sided migration. Migrants themselves, both illegal and legal from these regions should know the reason why people of other cultures would want to limit the amount of them coming in, especially considering how much death and destruction goes on in the Middle East &amp; Africa on a daily basis due to their religion, and with the extremely high chance of those with fundamentalist or non secular and separatist or oppressive ideas coming in the borders with them.\n\nOther than that, good luck also giving jobs to every single migrant as there's not enough new jobs being created yearly, even the 'shitty jobs' which people use as an excuse that migrants would take which are mainly because they are underpaid or illegally below minimum wage anyway thanks to dodgy employers.

For example, hip replacements in universal healthcare countries require waiting for years in some cases. \n\nEveryone wants to go to the doctor when they pay for it with their taxes.  It's free, so people use it for even the littlest things.  Many of these programs use up 40% of the governments total budget, a huge amount by any means.  Doctors make less money in some of these countries, so the best ones come to the US.  The wait time are especially bad for specialists.\n\nThe amount of hospitals that exist are the amount that were deemed necessary and sustainable by the free market.  You can't just plop down more hospitals to deal with demand, because when demand declines you are left with a serious bubble.

For example, hip replacements in universal healthcare countries require waiting for years in some cases. \n\nEveryone wants to go to the doctor when they pay for it with their taxes.  It's free, so people use it for even the littlest things.  Many of these programs use up 40% of the governments total budget, a huge amount by any means.

In other states the user is sent a bill - which most private health insurance covers the bulk of.\n\nOr you can also get Ambulance-only insurance for about $40 per year, which is pretty reasonable I think.\n\nBut either way, if you genuinely can't pay, you certainly still get taken to hospital regardless and in the end if you just can't pay, the worst that will happen is you will keep getting letters asking you to pay. They won't sue you if you can't pay and they will still continue taking you to hospital.\n\nI am a firm believer in socialised health, but I think ambulance cover as an exception is not a bad thing. First responders are a particularly limited resource that are also exceptionally ripe for abuse - when you see a doctor in a public hospital, they wouldn't ordinarily order surgery or treatment, unless it's medically indicated, which is a natural limit on expenditure of limited medical resources. However one particular issue with allocation of medical resources is what EMT teams call \"frequent flyers\" - members of the public with psychological issues relating to anxiety about their health, who unnecessarily attend Emergency frequently. At my local hospital emergency department, there are some such patients, suffering from no real condition, who bring themselves in on a weekly basis or sometimes even more often. \n\nFortunately at Emergency triage, there is a qualified person who can assess the severity of patient's complaint and prioritise resources accordingly, which minimises the impact of minor or non-medical complaints on other patients with more serious conditions being seen to in accordance to their need.\n\nWith free ambulance transport available on demand, that would not be the case with ambulance, because almost all calls have to be allocated resources (an ambulance and staff) immediately. \n\nI mean, I could live with it either way and I think there are arguments either way, but I think overall the logic of the current position is sound and doesn't create an undue pressure on patients to not use an ambulance when genuinely needed - I certainly believe that negative outcomes where a patient (or their family etc) believes that an ambulance is genuinely warranted by their condition (e.g. having a stroke), but doesn't actually call it due to fear of the cost would surely be far rarer, than the negative outcome facilitated by the alternative scenario - they call the free ambulance service in an emergency, but are unable to get one because the service is being over-used by patients who don't need them and could have gotten to hospital by any number of alternative means.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13","qSentId": 44995,"question": "Obviously conjecture as I don't understand Australia, but it seems like this was a separate, privately owned, ambulance service (think taxi but with trained and licensed professionals who can save your life).

The fact the guy chose not to pay for basic ambulance cover (which is very cheap and widely available) is his own fault, and an ambulance ride is around $800 (and ambulance cover is just a few dollars a week).

Generally 8 to 12 amps, giving you ~1 kWh, or ~3-5 miles of range per hour depending on your car's efficiency. Every car on the market that plugs in comes with one of these. \n\nLevel 2: 240v, wall-plug or hard-wired. Can supply anywhere from 15 to 40 amps (if the car can take it). These usually run anywhere from $400-$800 for home units, add a couple hundred for installation if you need an electrician to hard-wire it, or from $1500-$10,000 or more for commercial use (including things like RFID reader, computer to communicate to a server for payments, possible multiple cords, etc). These charge about ~15 miles per hour, again, depending on the amperage your car can take. \n\nLevel 3: DC charging. To be used sparingly as charging the batteries this fast tends to wear them out quicker. Most DC-capable cars offer 80% charge in 30 minutes (that's 0-80%). \n\nNote all of these systems will charge batteries much like your phone charges: it will charge quicker between 0 and 90% than it will from 90 to 100%. I've seen my home Level 2 charger give me 25 miles of range in an hour, when it was charging from ~30%. \n\nTesla supercharger: Insanely high DC charging. 80% of a Tesla battery in 40 minutes. Level 3 chargers charge 80% of an 18-23kWh battery in 30 minutes. Supercharger charges 60-85kWh batteries to 80% in 40 minutes.\n\nNow, it doesn't matter how many cars can be 'serviced' by a station, because each person has their own station. You charge at home, over night, when power companies are scaling back power generation because they can't sell the power they have.

The prime minister has said that the crisis showed why Japan\u2019s self defense forces needed to be freed of their post-war constraints so that the country had a military that could protect Japanese people abroad.\n\nTheir constitution explicitly states that the Japanese's right to wage war has been forfeit, and to a lot of people this is for good cause. They have a technologically advanced defense force and the backing of the biggest military powerhouse on the planet. Asking for more seems suspect at the least.\n\nWhat exactly are his goals and intentions of a Japanese military that has reign to move abroad?

It is NOT an apology from Japan the country.\n\nSo what does a real apology from a government look like?\n\n&gt; \"To acknowledge a long history of official depredations and ill-conceived policies by the Federal Government regarding Indian tribes and offer an **apology to all Native Peoples on behalf of the United States**.\"\n\nNote the existence of the written word *'apology'* and the lack of words like **my**, **I**, or **personal**.\n\nTDLR: Shinzo says fuck off. Japan is still not apologizing and we are changing the purpose of our military from one strictly for self defense into one where we can invade other countries again even though most of the public in Japan is totally against changing the modern, pacifist ideology of our military.\n\n","aSentId": 48660,"answer": "This entire post is a big run on technicality, because Prime Ministers obviously represent the government of their country. \n\nNot to mention there is far more apologizes than just that single one quoted.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13","qSentId": 48661,"question": "This entire post is a big run on technicality, because Prime Ministers obviously represent the government of their country. \n\nNot to mention there is far more apologizes than just that single one quoted.","aSentId": 48662,"answer": "1.

As a descendant of Arabs, I laugh at how child raping lunatics like Muslim extremists manage to fool you all into refusing to believe that this has anything to do with Islam. \n\n\n\n- You attacked us in Somalia; you supported the Russian atrocities against us in Chechnya, the Indian oppression against us in Kashmir, and the Jewish aggression against us in Lebanon.\n\n- Under your supervision, consent and orders, the governments of our countries which act as your agents, attack us on a daily basis;\n\n- These governments prevent our people from establishing the Islamic Shariah, using violence and lies to do so.\n\n-  These governments give us a taste of humiliation, and places us in a large prison of fear and subdual.\n\n- These governments steal our Ummah's wealth and sell them to you at a paltry price.\n\n- You steal our wealth and oil at paltry prices because of you international influence and military threats. This theft is indeed the biggest theft ever witnessed by mankind in the history of the world.\n\n- **These tragedies and calamities are only a few examples of your oppression and aggression against us. It is commanded by our religion and intellect that the oppressed have a right to return the aggression. Do not await anything from us but Jihad, resistance and revenge. Is it in any way rational to expect that after America has attacked us for more than half a century, that we will then leave her to live in security and peace**\n\n(1) The first thing that we are calling you to is Islam.\n\n(a) The religion of the Unification of God; of freedom from associating partners with Him, and rejection of this; of complete love of Him, the Exalted; of complete submission to His Laws; and of the discarding of all the opinions, orders, theories and religions which contradict with the religion He sent down to His Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Islam is the religion of all the prophets, and makes no distinction between them - peace be upon them all.\n\nIt is to this religion that we call you; the seal of all the previous religions. It is the religion of Unification of God, sincerity, the best of manners, righteousness, mercy, honour, purity, and piety. It is the religion of showing kindness to others, establishing justice between them, granting them their rights, and defending the oppressed and the persecuted. It is the religion of enjoining the good and forbidding the evil with the hand, tongue and heart. It is the religion of Jihad in the way of Allah so that Allah's Word and religion reign Supreme. And it is the religion of unity and agreement on the obedience to Allah, and total equality between all people, without regarding their colour, sex, or language.\n\n- It is the religion whose book - the Quran - will remained preserved and unchanged, after the other Divine books and messages have been changed. The Quran is the miracle until the Day of Judgment. Allah has challenged anyone to bring a book like the Quran or even ten verses like it.\n\n- The second thing we call you to, is to stop your oppression, lies, immorality and debauchery that has spread among you.\n\n- We call you to be a people of manners, principles, honour, and purity; to reject the immoral acts of fornication, homosexuality, intoxicants, gambling's, and trading with interest.\n\nWe call you to all of this that you may be freed from that which you have become caught up in; that you may be freed from the deceptive lies that you are a great nation, that your leaders spread amongst you to conceal from you the despicable state to which you have reached.\n- It is saddening to tell you that you are the worst civilization witnessed by the history of mankind:\n\n- You are the nation who, rather than ruling by the Shariah of Allah in its Constitution and Laws, choose to invent your own laws as you will and desire. You separate religion from your policies, contradicting the pure nature which affirms Absolute Authority to the Lord and your Creator. You flee from the embarrassing question posed to you: How is it possible for Allah the Almighty to create His creation, grant them power over all the creatures and land, grant them all the amenities of life, and then deny them that which they are most in need of: knowledge of the laws which govern their lives?\n\n- You are the nation that permits Usury, which has been forbidden by all the religions. Yet you build your economy and investments on Usury. As a result of this, in all its different forms and guises, the Jews have taken control of your economy, through which they have then taken control of your media, and now control all aspects of your life making you their servants and achieving their aims at your expense; precisely what Benjamin Franklin warned you against.\n\n- You are a nation that permits the production, trading and usage of intoxicants. You also permit drugs, and only forbid the trade of them, even though your nation is the largest consumer of them.\n\n- You are a nation that permits acts of immorality, and you consider them to be pillars of personal freedom. You have continued to sink down this abyss from level to level until incest has spread amongst you, in the face of which neither your sense of honour nor your laws object.\n","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13","qSentId": 49003,"question": "Why conspiracy?

Combine with the fact how much high quality meat Americans were giving to their Dogs and Cats (when China was way poorer and meat was considered a luxury), it created to perception that America care more for Dogs than people. \n\nNow days China are becoming wealthier, so pet ownership is once again common.

It was hard enough for Christian nations to adapt to it.  Indeed, Europe hasn't even fully transitioned.\n\nBut it seems to be much more difficult for Muslims.\n\nIn a gross simplification/summary-view we could say that Judaism was predominantly theocratic with Church/State very intertwined.  Tons of stuff about State in Jewish texts.  Christianity starts as a minority religion both within the context of Judea and Rome.  As such, the Christian texts do not prescribe how to run a state.  Indeed, the Christian texts are written in a context where some \"other\" power is there and should be respected/obeyed despite being \"other\".  Islam, on the other hand, starts minority but ends up firmly entrenched and in power rather quickly.  So, in essence, a good chunk of Islamic holy text does specifically have to do with how to run a state.\n\nDespite Christianity's beginnings, however, from Constantine to Luther the norm was Church and State linked at the hip.\n\nIt's not so hard, however, for Christians to go \"back\" to Separation of Church and State.  They don't have to ignore their texts to do so.  Muslims, however, more or less have to be willing to ignore or move beyond or somehow otherwise rationalize a disconnect between their holy text and reality as it pertains to State.\n\n","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13","qSentId": 51548,"question": "Alternatively I could live in a secular state and do neither, or all of them.
