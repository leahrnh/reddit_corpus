So you might start with just being asked to \"imagine\" spiders. Then maybe you'll be looking at pictures of spiders. Then, when you're ready, you might be in a room with a spider in the distance. Then, when you feel ready, you'll approach it. Ultimately, by the time you get in close contact with it, you will have habituated to it. It'll still be scary, but not as much as now.

Actually, it is the BEST therapy we have, period. No other disorders experience the same level of treatment success as anxiety treatments.

Instead, we are using tiled paintjobs on stuff where possible - so we paint metal on all metal surfaces, bronze on all bronze surfaces etc. That helps reduce the texture load. \n\nAlso, where possible, we use the lights to create different effects instead of making new textures. PBR is basically a newer method of applying textures to 3D models and objects in games, it really takes advantage of the lights and things can shine differently based on just changing numbers. This makes the load lighter, as we're just tweaking numbers, not loading a new texture for Metal1, Metal2, Metal3 etc. \n\nNow, thanks to a new update today for Unreal Engine 4, we are getting around 80-90fps with the Oculus. This means that a computer that can run high/ultra settings for a AAA game can run our demo without much problem. \n\nIn the case of letting you, the user, have the demo at home we would ensure that a number of things were simplified and redundant objects/assets were removed to lighten the load.

Your pre-order is worth twice to them what you save as a data collection point on the back end of the purchase. Your not getting a deal in the long run, you are getting the raw end of the transaction as a completely transparent and open consumer. Over time the AAA developers have engineered the current landscape of how digital distribution and content is packaged and sold as a result of too many people who lack patience as smart consumers. The \"take my money please\" stuff is funny and all, but if you take a step back it is obvious that it is the direct cause of all the current sad state of affairs that is plaguing the gaming community. The massive success of previous AAA franchises and the developers new model of DLC and pre-orders has let the big boys do whatever they want with absolutely zero risk.

Be patient.", "aSentId": 32237, "answer": "Hypothetical, meet practical.\n\nDisclaimer- I work as a software dev for a game company (I won't mention which one since I'm not speaking on their behalf). I have both served and led teams that have suffered delays, feature creep, death marches, and turnover, as well as the rare instances where a team succeeds under-budget and ahead of schedule; admittedly, I was rewarded with a pat on the back, small bonus and to watch in terror as most of my friends get laid off the following day.\n\nTechnically, the underlying engine has achieved fairly stable status on the PC (see Max Payne 3). Combine that with the fact that both the Xbone and PS4 run glorified PC hardware (x86 APUs, with very similar APIs to Mantle, OpenGL and DirectX), and the common complaints of porting to the PC with its different combinations of hardware/software begin to dry up. Granted, game engines do change over time, but other studios with far, far fewer resources than R* have developed cross-platform engines and games in much less time. Gameplay depth aside (my experience, gameplay itself doesn't change much between platforms- they're usually scripted in Lua/Python/etc), it's not difficult to understand that even the most technically-savvy gamers (which most PC diehards are composed of) are losing patience.\n\nIt all boils down to the fact that the PC gaming market is no longer being taken seriously by the suits at most of the AAA game studios (Ubisoft, Rockstar/T2, EA), and very few resources are allocated to the PC ports from the beginning. In Rockstar's case, I don't question their development teams' technical prowess- they've already proven themselves IMHO by squeezing the last bit of performance out of last gen- even the PS3/360 ports look impressive! I'm specifically referring to management's inability to allocate and plan, as well as a marketing dept that has few qualms against overselling the product and promising features that haven't yet been developed (17 months + initial heist announcements are quite a long time just to add a multiplayer mode- it's likely heists weren't yet implemented until very recently).\n\nThere's definitely an ethical problem within R*. Rather than be forthcoming with the reasons for the delay (conjecture: ill-equipped server and social club infrastructure), they chose to lay the blame solely at the already overworked, understaffed dev team by saying that the game itself needs more polish and optimization.\n\ntldr; R* management and marketing shat on the PC gaming community as well as their own developers in single announcement.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh03", "qSentId": 32236, "question": "Hypothetical:\n\nRockstar delays GTA V by a month and a half, Reddit complains that Rockstar couldn't make their dates and it's the worst thing ever.\n\nOr\n\nRockstar releases a buggy port of GTA V on PC in order to get it out on time and Reddit complains that it was a rushed port and that they hate their PC audience.

And lots of devs manage to do it on time. However big Rockstar fails to deliver ONE game which could run already on past-gens, and runs even better version well on current-gen. They had experience with GTA IV failure so they should understand that they must give proper manpower for porting and optimization of it. But no. All we currently see is just delays and delays. If they simply didn't gave date and would work till good enough for release and then announce date while working on additional bug-fixes it would do good. But they give promise of release in form of date, and they fail to keep this promise.\n\nIn simple - people are damn irritated because they waited already shitload of time and are not fond of waiting even more. One thing is to wait for game itself. But to wait just for PC version as long as for whole game ain't right.

I buy games like I drink water. But it's the *preorder gimmick* that it's troublesome.\n\nLet's face it. Rockstar took a helluva money in preorders and set a release date for February, after more than a year of the release of the console versions. People are willing to pay months upfront for a game which, in theory, should help the development of such game, and every time the game is a pile of bugs. The GTA V case is even worse because the game is already done and got two versions in the consoles already. Yet, Rockstar keeps holding the game release. More bugs to fix or building hype? Two years is too much time for bugfixes. They're messing with us.\n\nNow, what would happen if people *didn't* preorder? Rockstar would be more pressed to release the game as fast as they could to get the money. It would  come with lots of bugs that would be fixed in a month or so. Just like today. But you would be playing it earlier.\n\nEven if you love the game, just don't preorder. Heck, I wait at least a week after launch before purchasing anything. Most of the time the games are cool but kinda meh, so I end up waiting until a sale.

Money money money money- that is why they are Triple Dipping- that is why they are using these delays as an excuse to spruke pre-orders instead of actually giving us information.\n\nIf Rockstar truly cared about \"Quality\" as you say- they would never have released the game on the Xbox 360 or PS3 to begin with. No, this isn't some PC masterace thing- this is common sense. On the old consoles the game looked like shit, it barely ran, and people needed to jump through hoops just to get it to run. The game was too big for the console so they stripped out features, forced you to install AND run off disk- you basically had to jury-rig it even to get the level we had. Why would they have forced a version like that out with new consoles JUST around the corner? They wanted MONEY. If it was about quality they would have skipped the old consoles- went right to next gen and used the extra time to polish extra features/get heists ready.\n\nAs it stands people are triple dipping. They bought it new on 360/PS3- then when the new version came out rockstar advertised all the changes and said that the old versions would no longer be getting patched with all the new features due to size limitations- so what were people forced to do? Buy the game again at full price for the PS4/Xbone. Now the later they push the PC version the more likelihood that the people who spent full price two times before will now do the same thing again. How is rockstar ensuring that? Buffing up pre-order bonuses. \n\nIf they cared about quality their delay announcements wouldn't always be to increase preorders. Instead of offering more ingame cash, San Andreas, MORE ingame cash.. they would likely tell us what they were doing. Maybe add a few more very easy to add features such as Oculus Rift support- but no. Hell- if they did want to increase the rewards PC players get why would they limit it to Pre-Orders? It is common practice for a delayed game to give PC players additional content when it makes the leap. 500k for preorders? Nah. Why not 500k for all PC players regardless of if they bought it before launch, on launch or for sale at $5. \n\nSo no, I say again. Rockstar isn't about quality- it is about money. What is triple dipping on sales of the SAME GAME about? Money. How about improving/spruking preorder bonuses with each delay? Money. Rockstar knows that no matter what they do their titles are good enough that they can milk their fans for all they are worth- that is exactly what is happening here.
