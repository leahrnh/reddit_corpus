TC wind intensity actually drops significantly as you move outside something called the radius of maximum wind.  Judging by the distance from the center (or what was left of the center of the TC as it dissipates) to where OP said he was located, It shouldn't be too much to assume that OP is doing alright barring some extenuating circumstance.

A nice boring evening!\n\nThe location of house is a concern- exposed hill approx 100m elevation. Apparently, during the construction of this house 6 or 8 yrs ago (according to the neighbors and builders I meet). A cyclone or real bad storm come through and blew the roof off. Not once ...but twice the roof was blown off (2nd time due to another storm). And the windows got blown out on another occasion during the build --- they think -- something to do with air pressure from outside garage door being opened (on a windy day) with no inner door installed yet and popped or sucked the windows out (?).\n\nFortunately, due to these things happening the house.

It sounds like you house has its fair share of issues.\n\nJust as a side note, pressure differences due to wind are highly unlikely to blow out windows.  That is, unless the windows are very thin and large (single pane glass, for example), and the pressure difference created by the wind is very large which you would usually only see in events like tornadoes with extremely high wind speeds (which the wind in will usually just break the windows anyway). You'd need some kind of seal which wouldn't allow the pressure inside and outside to equalize, or at least not very quickly.\n\nHowever, I will say that it's quite strange to have windows just break like that, and I'm honestly not sure what could have caused it other than the wind itself blowing against them.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qi0i", "qSentId": 22028, "question": "I'm glad to hear that you're doing well!

It didn't break the windows. It kinda popped them right out of the window openings. Windows are aluminum/double glazed. \n\nBiggest window in the house is about 7ft x 4ft (it is nervously interesting to watch it flex during real windy days). I think I counted 45 windows in this house. Pretty sure not all of them popped out on the day in question. I think a few the big ones did at the North side of the house.\n\nI remember when they told me the windows got blown out...thinking - Wow! It blew (thinking broke) the windows(?)!\nThen they corrected me...no it literally blew them right out of the sockets. \n\nNot sure how they normally secure windows to the house in NZ....but they said they had to reinforce the securing of the windows with metal to the house. All I know is they secured them better vs before.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qi0i", "qSentId": 22031, "question": "Lightning Strikes Monument Valley, USA.
