However, Laurens had already promised Courtin that he would have a new ship built for him to command.  So, rather than just tell Courtin that he couldn't get it done, he began the financing of the ship completely on his own so that he wouldn't reneg on his deal with Courtin.  Laurens needed another ship anyway, but if he hadn't already promised Courtin that he had a job for him, he probably would have waited until he could procure another financier.\n\nThose same kinds of stories play out between ship captains and rich ship owners throughout the colonial period.

The only other place that name appears in any written record is in the death notices of the South Carolina Gazette in 1770; \"Last Friday died suddenly, Captain Thomas Courtin, master of the Brigandine Polly [almost certainly the ship mentioned previously as it was commissioned in 1763], of Poole, lately arrived from Newfoundland.\"  That's it. \n\nThe most telling part is that Laurens was depending on a fellow merchant to split the cost of the ship (as was common in those days, large ships are very expensive things and merchants preferred to build them as joint ventures as they were enough to strain even the most well-off finances) and the other guy backed out.  However, Laurens had already promised Courtin that he would have a new ship built for him to command.  So, rather than just tell Courtin that he couldn't get it done, he began the financing of the ship completely on his own so that he wouldn't reneg on his deal with Courtin.  Laurens needed another ship anyway, but if he hadn't already promised Courtin that he had a job for him, he probably would have waited until he could procure another financier.\n\nThose same kinds of stories play out between ship captains and rich ship owners throughout the colonial period.  It really makes you wonder what kind of unwritten social construct we may be missing there, because previously, the ludicrously rich (non-royal) elite would not have mixed so freely with the common sailors and workers, let alone feel that they had an obligation to keep any sort of promises with them, especially one that put such a strain on finances.", "aSentId": 42533, "answer": "Would make a great film!

The minuteman nonsense is an accepted part of American mythology, and has bedeviled our military ever since. Everyone seemed to have accepted this \"citizen-soldier\" myth, even at the time, to such an extent that the army was completely disbanded after the revolution (except for 80 privates to guard two armories). After the Shawnees and other natives repeatedly slaughtered armies of volunteer militia, congress finally grudgingly accepted a tiny, totally inadequate regular army. After every war the military was reduced to a pathetic shell; in 1939 the US army was smaller than that of Romania, and that meant that almost every company in WWII was commanded (initially) by an amateur. This myth plagued us right up through the second gulf war, when assumptions about the time needed to get citizen-soldier units ready for combat proved overoptimistic again and again (no slur on the soldiers, just the poor planning). So, it is the American people's emotional devotion to this concept of the citizen soldier (epitomized by the myth of the guerrilla nature of the revolution) that meets the criteria for this thread (assuming \"people\" equals \"leader\" in a democracy).\n\nSnipers and skirmishers were important in very few battles (like Saratoga), but when the British encountered irregular forces (Long Island), they usually backed off and shelled the forest until it burned, then slaughtered the fleeing riflemen with dragoons. \n\nSince about 20-30% of the colonists supported the British (and formed large numbers of militia units), they had the same people with the same capability, and examples flexible and guerrilla-like of loyalist units were Tarleton's legion and the bands of local fighters know (ironically) as \"cow-boys.\" \n\nAmong the German regiments rented by the British crown (they weren't mercenaries, their kings just rented them to England) were lots of \"jaeger\" rifle units, which were used for patrolling and skirmishing. Cornwallis converted his whole southern army to light infantry, and out marched and outfought every force sent against him until he ran out of men and supplies and withdrew to Virginia.
