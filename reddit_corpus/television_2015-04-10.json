Oftentimes you'll hear a phrase or see an event and wonder what the hell it was about, only to have that question answered a hundred pages later when he revisits the same event, but now with the missing information. He shows this tendency even at the sentence level, where, between the subject and the predicate, he might suddenly branch into an aside that's reliant on the predicate to make sense, so that the sentence itself is confusing up until the final word.\n\nThis style can be incredibly frustrating if you've never come across it, as it does violate what most readers these days expect from a story. And because of this frustration a lot of people give up on him prematurely, without ever reaching the payload. The important point though is that there *is* a payload, and, Faulkner being a genius, it's pretty damned magnificent when it does arrive.\n\nAlso, as a by-product of this tendency, he's more satisfying if you don't take super long breaks between reading sessions.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh6e", "qSentId": 36460, "question": "Im gonna miss it too, but cities can have their share of abandoned and forgotten locations too.

The problem is when some random website's poorly-managed database gets compromised.\n\nWhen a website stores a password, it (ideally) doesn't actually store the password itself.  The website stores a hash of the password.  By this I mean it uses a standard mathematical algorithm to generate a garbled string of data from that password.  That garbled string will always be the same for the same password, and there is no mathematical way to turn the garbled string back into the original password, or even learn anything at all about the original password like length, etc.  So the only way to get the garbled string is to start off with the original password, and if you have the garbled string, you still don't know the original password.\n\nSafe, right?  No.  If you have the hash, you can try random passwords until you generate a new hash that matches the hash you got from that compromised website's database.  Then you know the original password.  If your password is \"passwerd\", that's going to be within the first 100 or so attempts, and it will take seconds.  If your password is \"this is seriously a secure fucking password\", that is going to take a hell of a long time for anyone to come up with randomly.\n\nSo what?
