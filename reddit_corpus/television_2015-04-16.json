Garak points out why Sisko asked him to help: Garak could do those things that were needed, no matter how dirty and Sisko knew it.  So Sisko took a hit in the pride, but it was worth it, it was worth it.  Star Trek is also about challenging our beliefs and how we feel about certain actions, and this episode is universally praised as some of the best Star Trek has to offer.\n\nIs DS9 Roddenberry's Star Trek?

It can begin with  a Federation ship of some sort reporting that Ambassador Spock has disappeared, and so has Romulus. \n\nThe Romulans being virtually wiped out except for the ones off world with their fleet would be a pretty good starting off point. That's a major disruption to the balance of power there. The remaining Romulans would be trying to rebuild their star empire, or just trying to resettle somewhere much like the new universe's Vulcans are.\n\nAll the other major powers who are so inclined would be angling to seize control of Romulan territory, the Federation may try to offer aid to the Romulans, but whether or not they'd accept it could be a thing. \n\nAnd there'd probably be some Admiral who's gone nuts and is secretly evil. Because that's what Admirals do in Star Trek. It's why Janeway got promoted before Picard! Those blue antennae aliens could show up and explain why they had diminished, and the pig-like ones could show up as well. And the Vulcans might take point, but then have some sort of crisis with its youth, when for some reason, some of them use logic and decide that the thing they must do to truly help their cousin species survive is to re-embrace emotions as Sybok and various other Vulcans have in the past, and help the Romulans repopulate by going native. Logically, they say, it would lead to peace as the new Romulan converts would be more peaceful and can influence the star empire from within. Of course, I guess that'd mean there'd be some subplot about pureblooded Romulans and it'd end up being another metaphor of some sort against racial prejudices and whatnot. \n\nThey can use a new Enterprise crew, maybe Picard's already a retired Admiral, maybe Riker is the recurring Admiral and was at some point finally captain of the Enterprise, but now it's a new crew, new captain. Or maybe it's a new ship with a different name that's center stage.\n\nOr maybe it's an ensemble thing, with no particular starring starship, and they have multiple locations and storylines and characters intertwining. Different planets, political stuff, focusing on different factions, maybe different space ships. I guess it'd be like Game of Thrones... in space!\n\nGame of Thrones in space, guys, using Star Trek.
