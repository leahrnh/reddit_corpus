It would say \"camera cannot be accessed\". The only option would be to restart. \n\nAnother (small)ish issue...there were times where, for some reason, MMS wouldn't work. I do remember when the nexus 5 came out (I bought it on launch day back in november 2013) that the MMS would not work properly regardless of your APN settings - solely because hangouts did not have the capability to send mms, only sms.

A watch isn't a new item. Some people will get it at first but then eventually stop wearing it.

Even though this is a bigger product, look at the Microsoft Surface. First gen was awful but the third gen was just absolutely fantastic. Same with the iPad. It was a new product so it was attractive, but it wasn't really special until the iPad 3 came out with the beautiful display.\n\nI'm just saying first gen products are generally MUCH weaker than 3rd gen because the company learns a lot from its customers and from just more R&amp;D.\n\nI don't know if you know what Google Now is but it's basically Google giving you information about your life without you needing to look for it. We're talking flight information, traffic and easily accessibly navigation to work, home, or other places you frequently go to or have recently search. Sports games of teams you've selected you're interested in, etc. More and more things are added each update and it's really grown to be SUPER useful (all of my iPhone owning friends are actually jealous of it). \n\nAndroid Wear utilizes this so when you're \"on your watch\" it's not you sitting there navigating through apps and menus trying to find information. It's just swipe up or down. The watch is meant to be a supplement to get information quick and get out, not fooling around with it like you would your phone.\n\nThe Apple Watch has a dial or what they call the \"crown\" to navigate through your watch. This, to me at least, means they intend the user to need to go through lots of menus to do things. They said when they announced it it was because you shouldn't block the beautiful watch with your finger, which is ridiculous considering they expect you to constantly need your finger on your watch.

That's incorrect. \n\n**Eliminating your PageFile is a bad idea**. \n\nAnd it doesn't significantly increase the life of your SSD. (Found originally at Ars Technica: http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=21013929#p21013929 )\n\n&gt; Here is why eliminating the pagefile is a bad idea - with no possible mitigating circumstances that I can see.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are essentially three categories of stuff that Windows tries to keep in RAM:\n&gt; \n&gt; Category 1 isn't a matter of \"tries to.\" It has to be kept in RAM at all times. This has names like \"nonpaged pool\" and \"nonpageable OS and driver code\".\n&gt; \n&gt; Category 2 is what Windows calls \"committed\", or in some displays \"private commit\" or \"private bytes.\" It is \"backed by\" the pagefile, which is to say that if all of it can't be kept in RAM at one time, the remainder will be written to the pagefile until it's needed again. The longest-ago-referenced stuff gets written out there first.\n&gt; \n&gt; Incidentally, even if that happens, it also stays in RAM and can be accessed without reading from the pagefile, as long as no other process needs the RAM. This is thanks to what is called the \"standby page list,\" which is a system-wide cache of such pages.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, I know, you're going to say \"but when I leave my browser with 145 tabs open overnight, the next morning there's a delay as it's all paged back in!\" Well assuming that that page-in is really what's happening, that is not a gratuitous act by Windows. No, something else needed that RAM or it wouldn't have been paged out and then assigned to something else.\n&gt; \n&gt; But that isn't the main reason that eliminating your pagefile is stupid.\n&gt; \n&gt; Category 3 is pageable, similar to category 2, but it is backed by \"mapped files\" rather than by the pagefile. Category 3 includes the code from every .exe you're running, the code from every .dll (and other dll-like things, like scr's and cpl's and so on) used by all those .exe's, the data from every file opened explicitly for mapped file access, the data from every file opened for ordinary read/write access without bypassing the file cache (which means just about every data file), and in Vista and later, all the files being Superfetch'd too. All that stuff is backed by whatever files it came from in the first place.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, here's the issue...\n&gt; \n&gt; I TELL YOU THREE TIMES I TELL YOU THREE TIMES I TELL YOU THREE TIMES: Getting rid of the pagefile does not eliminate paging to and from disk!!!\n&gt; \n&gt; Getting rid of the pagefile only eliminates paging to and from disk for category 2. It doesn't do a thing for category 3!\n&gt; \n&gt; In fact, eliminating your pagefile will require category 3 to be paged more, to make up for the fact that every last byte of category 2 has to be kept in RAM at all times.\n&gt; \n&gt; (Unless, of course, you have so much RAM that all of categories 1, 2, and 3 can be kept in RAM at all times. You almost certainly don't. To see if you do, check the \"Virtual bytes\" Performance counter for the Process object, \"_Total\" instance. And keep in mind that even that isn't all of the system's virtual memory needs. And then consider that if you do have that much RAM, getting rid of your pagefile won't affect things a damn bit. Because, ah, if you have that much RAM, nothing is going to be paged out to the paging file and then its memory used by some other process anyway.)\n&gt; \n&gt; So... all you are doing by eliminating the pagefile is getting rid of one out of dozens, maybe hundreds, of files that are, in essence, used as pagefiles. Repeat: one out of dozens, at best. You really think that will matter?\n&gt; \n&gt; Worse: Not only does eliminating your pagefile not eliminate paging to disk... It also forces Windows to make worse decisions as to what to page to disk, then it otherwise would. With no pagefile, ancient old private commit data that your programs may never want to touch again will have to be kept in RAM forever... forcing more recently-touched stuff in category 3 to be paged.\n&gt; \n&gt; Let me say that again: you may be forcing Windows to page out mapped file contents that you touched recently, because you're insisting on keeping in RAM stuff that you touched a long time ago.\n&gt; \n&gt; I'm afraid I cannot envision a scenario where this is anything but a stupid idea.\n&gt; \n&gt; Well... other than those cases where it isn't even stupid.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qgzt","qSentId": 49840,"question": "Whichever one you get, enable AHCI mode in the bios, run windows 8.1, turn auto defrag off, disable paging files, and update the firmware.","aSentId": 49851,"answer": "I was planning on running Windows 7 again on it.

The DT 880s come in several impedance ratings. I only have experience with the 600 ohm (the highest one) and a magni/modi stack can power it without issue, but 250 ohm may be better for general use (especially if you plan on using them with a phone or other portable device) and they should all sound the same.

I read the commonly asked questions on r/headphones, but could you please explain what the Schiit Magni and Modi do? How do those headphones function without them?","aSentId": 50207,"answer": "Alright, so the Modi is a DAC or Digital to Analog Converter. It takes the digital input from a USB and converts it into a standard RCA red/white output. The unit doesn't require any additional power and has no controls. It has a single LED light to indicate that the USB is supplying power and does its converting work without any input from you. The Magni is a headphone amp. A headphone amp is just like any amplifier only scaled down to the point that it is only really useful for powering headphones instead of full size speakers. As a trade-off they are typically cheaper, smaller, and more power efficient. The Magni in particular has one power input (which is used for the included power cable) and two audio inputs (which is conveniently a standard RCA red/white cable set up). The only controls on it are a power on/off switch and a volume control. Essentially it takes the input signal and makes it stronger so that it can power the drivers in your headphones. An important note is that the audio out on the Magni is a 6.35mm audio jack (you are probably used to seeing the smaller 3.5mm jack). This is the standard size for the DT 880 and most studio quality headphones and adapters are very easy to find and cheap (the DT 880s come with one included in the box). \n\nThe main advantage of having an external DAC and amp are having less interference. A sound card or integrated sound on your motherboard can preform the same function as an external unit, but they ultimately suffer from noise as the result of being in such close proximity to other active circuits on your motherboard. In addition, they often are rated for a lower impedance. As I mentioned in my previous comment DT 880s and most higher end headphones come in a range of impedances. This is essentially the resistance of the headphone drivers. The higher the impedance, the more power it takes to make them make noise. If I plug in a pair of 600 ohm headphones into the integrated sound on a motherboard, the highest volume setting would likely be much quieter than the highest volume setting on an external unit. The DT 880s also come in 250 ohm and 32 ohm variants, but it is often recommended to get the highest impedance that your amp can safely run as it will have the highest sound accuracy. They *should* all sound the same, but the higher the impedance the more likely that it will actually fall within accepted levels. \n\nI particularly like the Magni/Modi combo because they are simple, cheap compared to the competition, look great, and sound perfect. Headphones are always personal preference and it is recommended that you try one out before you buy anything, but in my experience the DT 880s have fairly universal appeal with all types of music and they are by far the most comfortable headphones I have ever worn. Their biggest weakness by far is that they leak sound like crazy. They practically act as speakers so if you are looking for something to wear in the office or don't want people to hear what you are listening to, they are probably not for you.\n\nLet me know if you have any other question or want some other suggestions!","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qgzt","qSentId": 50208,"question": "Alright, so the Modi is a DAC or Digital to Analog Converter.

The HD650s are a bit... stratified. That is to say that each particular segment of sounds seems isolated from each other. This is particularly noticeable with their bass. It is strong enough, but it feels disjointed from the rest of the sound. They also are rather warm sounding as well(purely subjective, I don't even know how to convey that in an objective way). \n\nI have never heard the ATH-ES10s so I can't comment. In my short google search they apparently have a very different sound signature than the typical Audio-Technica line. I have only ever heard their M50s (probably their most prolific model) and they sound absolutely incredible for their price bracket, but I wouldn't consider it a fair fight between them and either the HD650s or the DT 880s.\n\nThe 880s sound very even to me across all frequencies. They have a more distinct treble than most and that can be a bit grating at first if you are coming from a bass heavy set, but it sounds great once you get used to actually hearing vocals and the higher ranges of instruments. They sound the most live performance-like of any pair I have tried. Another option is the 990s but they tend to be shifted even higher in frequency and many find their treble to be grating even after you get used to them.\n\nAgain, if you have the chance just try them out to see what one you like. The subject can get a bit heated because once you get used to the sound of a certain pair everything else tends to sound like shit. I went from a pair of ATH-M50s to DT 880s and the sound profile was very similar so I was able to adjust pretty easily and I couldn't be happier. \n\nA Magni/Modi stack would work just as well for all of these up to at least a 600 ohm impedance, and that is what I would recommend. It is just such a simple setup that works so well that I have a hard time suggesting anything else. As for their use without a full external DAC and amp, I can only speak for the DT 880s. I use them with my HTC M8 phone from time to time and with the integrated sound card on my laptop as well. The bass tends to drop out a fair bit, but they don't sound bad by any stretch of the imagination. I would say my 600 ohm impedance headphones that I normally use with 30% volume on my magni turns into 75% volume on my phone and 60% on my laptop. I would say I listen at a fairly normal level, so if you like very loud music you may run into a ceiling with portable devices and high impedance headphones (600 ohm is the highest typically offered and I would go with 250 ohm in that case). \n\nListening to any of these without an external DAC/amp is going to sound like a huge step up if you are used to a pair of budget headphones/earbuds and an integrated sound system. An external DAC/amp is just another (probably smaller) step up beyond that. \n\nEdit: On the subject of bass with electronic music, I don't think either the HD650 or the DT 880 (and probably the ATH-ES10... again, no experience) would have trouble putting out what you are looking for.

The difference between say a Topping TP-30 and a Magni/Modi stack may seem to be a matter of cost and utility to the average user. In fact, the TP-30 wins in both of these realms.
