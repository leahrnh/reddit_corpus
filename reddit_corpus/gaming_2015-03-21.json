The games industry uses stone age QA techniques, which means that in order to ship a product, QA becomes a massive expense.

The result is high-expense, low quality QA that is an unstable, seasonal job performed by people looking to get out of QA and into being \"real developers\".\n\nSome studios have begun to move away from brute force QA, but the process is non-trivial. There is a definitive lack of experience in test automation and developer-owned test in the industry as a whole. As a result, hiring leadership or developers who can do QA right is incredibly difficult. Worse, SDETs are gobbled up by the Amazon, Microsoft, and Googles of the world, which makes getting them into a game company expensive and straight-up difficult (who wants to leave Google for an EA studio like as not to get blown up in six months anyway?).
