Please!\n\n*Cassie hurtles wildly around the corner into the alley, and is confronted by a tall wire fence.

She almost makes it to the top, struggling through agony.*\n\nCASSIE: Please, just stop for a moment! I can catch up!\n\n*She stretches too far to reach the top of the fence and tears a wound in her side.

It's so difficult for me to separate the representation of a violent act, with me thinking how utterly terrifying would that be to experience, 1st or 2nd hand.

I'll liken it to a scene in LA Noire. There is a standout plot thread in that game where you investigate the rape of underaged girl.

If you know a finisher or not, it doesn't change the game mechanics or narrative. The fantasy of the rest of the game doesn't leak into how believable any of it is and it's hard to escape that these are incredibly clear graphics, showing with incredible accuracy, the human body being mutilated.

She would never willingly get in that situation, so it was instead forced onto her.\n\nI think it makes for an excellent game, an excellent story, and an excellent character.  She walks out of it covered in scars, mud, tears and no small amount of trauma, but she walked out when she had no business managing to do so.\n\nWalker is a soldier, so while his story is great, I don't find him to be as inspiring.  Nor do I find Brody, who is 'A Warrior' as the story reminds us over and over, but that's not to say either of these are lacking in any regard.  I just feel like the latest Tomb Raider was the first Underdog story that we've had in a long time that actually felt like an honest-to-God underdog that just could not catch a break.

For instance:\n\n&gt;Ius, Animal God\n\n&gt;The statues one sees throughout Valenwood and parts of Hammerfell and Elsweyr that seem to be of a misshapen humanoid carrying a rod are of Ius, the God of Animals.\n\n&gt;The rod He carries has its origin in the tale of The Ox and The Evil Farmer. It seems that one day an evil farmer decided to kill all of his animals and have a big party. As The story unfolds, animal after animal is killed and prepared for a big meal. Lastly the farmer comes to the ox and prepares to slit its throat. The ox, not wishing to be anybody's dinner, prayed very vocally to Ius. This came out as a loud Moo, of course.\n\n&gt;At that very instant Ius appeared carrying a rather large set of balance weights. Without explanation, Ius ate the farmer and vanished. Ever since that day Ius The Extremely Agitated, has always been portrayed as carrying a large set of scales with him. The local Ius worshipers have no idea why and do not seem to care. Although this story has been called fanciful at best, I personally know a raccoon who had actually talked to The Ox. That is, before the Ox became filler for the local inn's larder.\n\n&gt;I do not have any information one way or the other about the validity of this second myth. It is, however, quite traditional.\n\n&gt;It seems that many, many years ago, before the reign of Uriel Septim VII, before the reign of Cephorus Septim II, yes, even before the age of Pelagius Septim III (long may his name be praised!), there lived a wombat who was the pet of Lady Greelina, daughter of the Lord Prufrock of Rockcreek. Lady Greelina loved her wombat so, and it loved her too with all the passionate intensity a marsupial can muster.\n\n&gt;Unfortunately, it was a time of great sorrow in Rockcreek. A pestilence had come through the town, destroying all their cash crops (which consisted of raspberries and a few scraggly odd weeds that caused Argonian women to look very attractive to those who partook); Then a plague had come, inflicting nearly every cobbler with chronic hiccoughs; finally a witch had cursed the townspeople so the only words any could utter were \"Hmmm. Precisely.\" All the businesses, stores, and guilds fled from the town faster than an extremely fast thing.\n\n&gt;Lady Greelina saw her father despairing the loss the town was suffering, so she brought her wombat in and told him, \"Father, my wombat can save us all, for it is sacred to the god Ius, God of Animals. The only reason I didn't tell you earlier is because I am an early adolescent going through that period when I don't like to communicate. But please, ask a wish of my wombat, and Ius will fulfill it, for my wombat loves me.\"\n\n&gt;The king thought this was fairly flakey, but he had nothing to lose so he uttered a modest wish to the wombat, \"All I want is for one business to come to Rockcreek that will never leave no matter the calamity.\"\n\n&gt;I probably should have mentioned before that the king had always been cruel to the wombat (he used to lick it and try to make it stick to walls), so the wombat had Ius create an equipment store in front of the palace gate that would never go away. The royal family ended up going mad and eating one another (and ironically, the wombat was one of the first to go).

For example, if you threw a load of zennies into your Navi, it would obviously be stronger.\n\nHowever, you can create an efficient navi for cheap by solving a number of complex puzzles. These puzzles would have an extremely high limit, so you could keep going depending on how good you are. IE. A game similar to 2048, where it expands and gets harder if you get to certain interval, Time restraints on Boolean logic problems, etc.\n\nYou could also have a desktop version that would be used with your mobile device. You could have multiple Navis on the desktop, but only one per mobile device.

As Ingress shows, lots of people are stuck with no other players around, and I'm not a fan of NIA's hands-off approach to them- it basically treats them like second-class players for the crime of living in a less-populated area. Maybe instead of having fixed-point portals, allow matchmaking to anyone online, anywhere, and then have the outcome of the battle affect the Net-space local to both players. Lose the battle and your faction's influence takes a hit, win and you secure the local network for your faction. There would have to be some kind of system to incentivise actually getting out and about though, perhaps a faction-control decay similar to Ingress portal decay, and maybe also have a \"hack\" function similar to Ingress where you can farm chips, Zenny, NaviCust parts, etc. from areas by engaging in virus busting.

I won't ever use a payment system that does not give me this ability, and I'm sure I speak for many, many people.\n\nYou use such a system all the time; it's called cash.\n\nI can't imagine we could implement the real-world systems we have (credit, investment-based lending, commercial paper) without there existing some equivalent to cash. That doesn't mean that most of the world's transactions occur in cash; just that a cash-equivalent instrument is, I think, probably a necessary element of an economy.\n\nI don't think people in the future will actually deal with the Bitcoin blockchain directly, any more than people tend to pay for things in stores with wads of bills. But the system that will come about with \"distributed credit\", etc., might be *based on*, and phrased *in terms of*, a cryptocurrency.\n\nIn the US, we think of greenbacks as the intermediary form money travels in, even when it's all happening on some Visa gateway or over Paypal.

Imagine \"BTC\" or some variant being the world's reserve currency that banks hold. Imagine people's chequing/savings/credit accounts being denominated in terms of it. Imagine their paycheques being denominated in terms of it. Imagine mints (which can still exist; they just have to hold an amount of BTC equivalent to the amount of physical tokens they want to put in circulation) all issuing coins that say \"3mBTC\" or the like.\n\nBut, most importantly, imagine **everything else** staying pretty much the same as it is today. Even if the world economy gets detached from the US, it will still belong to a bunch of banks and payment processors. People use those because they *like* the hub-and-spoke model, same as why they use Facebook instead of email.\n\nOr, to put it another way: imagine the Euro without a government running it.

They go by different names in different games but are essentially the same thing. A style usually will give megaman an elemental affinity (e.g. fire, water) which causes chips of the same type to be stronger but makes you weak against that elements weakness (fire is weak against water,etc). They also often change your charged mega buster ability (a sword, \"beam\" attacks, etc). Styles act a little different in each game In some games they activate at the start of battle (like in SF2) and in others you need a special chip or meet certain battle conditions (like the \"noise\" meter in SF3). \n\nSpecifically in SF2, one save slot would have the \"zerker\" style and the other would have the \"ninja\" style or \"saurian\" style depending on the version. \n\nSF3 had 12 styles that were shared across versions, as well as a couple that were exclusive to specific versions. There also is an esentialy \"ultimate\" mode called \"Black Ace\" or \"Red Joker\" depending on your version, which was OP and typically ended the battle in a couple turns. \n\nIf you want to know more about these I suggest looking at the websites or a game FAQ designed for one of those things. It's surprisingly complex considering the target demographic.\n\nProbably the biggest gripe about Starforce is that the difference in versions means you have to research a bit before you buy the game to know which you really want. It's kind of like the Pokemon games; it's meant to encourage you to play with others to unlock all the abilities.
