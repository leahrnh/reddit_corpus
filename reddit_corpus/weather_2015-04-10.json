Generally they just leave a tiny little black mark where they hit, and a slightly larger black mark where it exits the plane. Really hard to find sometimes, but generally on a fastener.

That pretty much fucks the internal structure of the fastener. \n\nNow, that isn't what happened here (if the picture in the article is the actual damage). That part of the plane is composite, and generally has some sort of conductive material (generally aluminium) to take the lightning to the fuselage.
