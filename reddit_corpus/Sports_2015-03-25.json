Let me try to go at it a little more directly: \n\n- *Almost any* conduct that has ethical consequences (regardless of your system you're using to judge actions that cause consequences) will have consequences that are independent of culture and time. \n\n- Example: Is it ethical for a 30 year old man to marry an 8 year old girl? I would say no, because: \n\nPremise 1) Humans are capable of free will. \n\nPremise 2) Exercising that free will is the most fundamental part of being human. \n\nPremise 3) Do to her minority, and 8 year old is incapable of consenting to things like marriage and sex.  \n\nConclusion: A 30 year old man marrying an 8 year old girl denies her the opportunity of exercising her free will.  \n\nThroughout that entire logical chain, culture and time never appear. It doesn't matter if you're in Grenada in 1350 or Texas in 1990: A 30 year old man marrying a 8 year old girl is a violation of the 8 year old's human rights.  \n\nNow, we know that child marriage is still very common in certain countries, and that those cultures find nothing wrong with it.  Does that change anything in the logical chain? No.  That why we shouldn't accept moral relativism, because culture and time are irrelevant to the logical chains that create ethical judgments.*\n\n*(The only exception I can think of is when the conduct that could be considered unethical is actually related to culture. Ex: It might be unethical for a western woman to walk through Mecca in a bikini because it would be insulting to the predominant culture. Maybe).

A match starting on Monday morning will not end until Friday evening.  They'll play about 7 hours each day, with breaks.  Each team has two innings, and an innings (there is an 's' in the singular form) lasts until ten of a team's eleven batsmen are out.  This can take a long time, and a lot of matches end in draws.  Watching a losing team chase a draw is actually part of the excitement.\n\nNaturally, it is inconvenient for most people to watch a full Test match.  And it's nearly impossible to have a worldwide tournament using that format.  So One Day International cricket (\"ODI\") was developed.  Each team has one innings of 50 \"overs,\" and an over is 6 balls.  So the task for the batting side is not to stay alive as long as possible (as it sometimes but not always is in a Test match), but rather to score as many runs off of 300 balls as possible.  A match lasts one day, and usually takes about 7 hours.\n\nSo this is the World Cup of Cricket, and it uses the ODI format.  There is an even shorter form called Twenty/20, where an innings is 20 overs.  That format takes just a little longer than a standard baseball game, so people can watch a whole game after work or whatever.
