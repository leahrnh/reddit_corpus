But since it was added to Netflix, I've been watching it quite a bit.  I think I'm on season five.\n\nI'm enjoying the show, both from the intended entertainment, and the reflection on its cultural influence.  Watching the show and realizing that this was probably the episode that aired the night before my friends at school all started saying 'how you doin'' and cracking up is sort of fun.\n\nI also like seeing how relevant, and at the same time, how dated it is.  \n\nI think the humor, for the most part, is still fairly relevant to the year 2015.  A lot of the humor relies on you having friends that are 'just like [Chandler, Joey, Ross, Phoebe, Rachel, or Monica]', and I think each prototype still exists.  Relationships and friendships are still awkward, yet rewarding..  And some of the plot points are amazingly relevant to the 21st century.  For example, [Small spoilers](#s \"Chandler dates a girl online before meeting her in person.  And there is a lesbian couple that is (mostly) supported, and gets married.\").\n\nHowever, some of the plot points just could not exist today.  For example, some of the jokes rely on characters not knowing who is calling.  There is no caller ID, no call waiting until season two or three, and cell phones are only becoming common now in season five.  There was also an episode where one of the major plot points was about Joey and Chandler being excited that they were getting free porn on their television.  And, of course, almost every episode has a shot of the twin towers.\n\nI think I'm enjoying the show more as a 27 year old than I would have earlier in my life.  The frustration of being an adult is really fresh to me.  I see myself and my friends settle for jobs that they don't want, despite being qualified for the careers we really want, because paying our rent is more important than being happy.  Watching people make huge mistakes, and not knowing how to help them (or just stop them).  We've all been in long-term relationships, some have married, and some of us have divorced.  Our parents are getting sick and dying.

It makes things complicated.  Netflix does really well by being really simplistic.  It's one of those bills that people forget they have if they use stream only, because it's just cheap and a part of their day to day lives.  Introducing complicated pricing tiers messes with perception of the overall value proposition.  You want Netflix to be in every home so that people just assume others have it, not for people to be having discussions like \"oh I'm only tier 2, I guess we'll need to go to your place to watch XXX?\"\n\n\n\n2.
