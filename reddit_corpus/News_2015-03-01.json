Thank you for your time on the reply! ", "aSentId": 7578, "answer": "Well, it's a big problem that I don't pretend to have a simple solution for. But at the root of it is apathy and a disconnect between the military and civilian elements of American society. Americans pay outward respect to their military veterans, and that's good, but I don't think they really understand, or honestly *want* to understand the veteran/military experience. I'm not a vet so I won't ever really know what it's like to serve, but I know enough to grasp that it's something bigger than patriotic halftime shows, or \"Thank you for your service\", or capitalizing the \"V\" in \"Veteran\" can ever hope to do justice to (yes we were required to do that). Heroism is part of it, but that term has been so eroded as to mean nothing these days. I consider military members public servants of the highest order because while I (a civilian) pledge to defend the constitution against enemies foreign and domestic, I have a reasonable expectation that I'm not going to lose my life in the fulfillment of that duty. These military public servants are held to something more than I am, and I have a respect for that much like I respect the office of the president, even though I may disagree with his policies. Likewise, all (most) vets aren't boy scouts, but I respect their commitment. I think our country does a tremendous disrespect to these people when we choose to blindly laud them as heroes or pat them on the head as victims, but won't treat them like the real people they are. They don't want to be treated like cartoon characters or pets up for adoption, but that's what they get, because it's easier for the rest of us than coming to grips with the complexities of their experiences. \n\nVA has, unfortunately, become that disconnect and that apathy incarnate.  Its very reason for existence is to help DoD offload its baggage (\"former stakeholders\" if you will) and to compartmentalize the tremendous enduring cost of war. Until recently we were still paying benefits to survivors of Civil War veterans. War is crazy expensive. After DoD, VA is the second largest agency in the federal government and pays more in compensation benefits alone (never mind medical treatment) than the budgets of DHS and many other large agencies. But if you really think about it, aren't VA and DoD part of the same operation? It's almost like buying a car with a warranty and then finding out that the warranty is administered by a totally separate third entity. Why do companies do such things? To limit liability, deflect responsibility, and to keep branding intact. My point is: VA should be part of DoD. Sure having it be its own cabinet level agency seems altruistic, but to separate it from the military components robs it of its relevance to current policy and facilitates the dereliction of moral responsibility to our vets. When I worked there, data sharing was so bad that many vets had to submit extensive documentation just to prove they served.  How off putting is that? Serve your country and now the agency tasked with delivering your promised benefits hasn't even heard of you?! You have to track down paperwork to prove you deserve support?! I know I'd be pissed.\n\nVA's current slogan is \"ICARE\" by the way. It's a fucking backronym that shows just how desperately the suits in DC are grasping at straws to \"right the Titanic\" while leadership attrition and scandal continues as it always has. \n\nSo yes, I support complete overhaul of the monetary benefits system and a top to bottom review of the hospital network, but neither is politically tenable because Congress won't push for anything beyond rote platitudes when it comes to vets. They want easy wins for pro-vet lawmaking, but the real problems are big, tough ones that would take decades to fix and aren't sexy enough to get you re-elected. Despite what it may look like, America's relationship with its military is on the rocks.  Until we can reconcile with that the we will continue to fail vets - shaking their hands, patting then on the back, even throwing money at them - anything for them to stop making us feel uncomfortable and just be the two-dimensional characters we want them to be. We can't, and shouldn't compartmentalize away vets as objects of pity or problems to be solved.  They are who they are because we asked it of them. They *are* us. The root of the apathy and dysfunctional cultural relationship we have with them is because we treat them as *others*. \n\nMy best advice to vets seeking benefits is to stay proactive. Keep copies of everything, cc your congressman if necessary, and compare notes with fellow vets. And remember, the people on the other side aren't out to get you - most of them are vets too - stuck in the same larger problem that may take generations to heal.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l", "qSentId": 7577, "question": "I appreciate your input on this.

Delafield and Oconomowoc are places where million dollar homes are built in subdivisions and then sold later to people.  the market place there allows for a 1.5 million dollar house to be built prior to having a buyer.\n\nNow people on the coasts, that doesn't sound like a lot, but a 1.5 million dollar home in Wisconsin would be like a 3 million dollar home in California.    Homes in Wisconsin that are 400k would be million dollar homes in other places.   A 400k home in California would be, depending on where you are - at MOST be about 170k and probably closer to 130k here in Wisconsin.\n\nSo think of a subdivision full of 3 million dollar homes, every one of them, next to a old farm -- and that's this area.\n", "aSentId": 10304, "answer": "With neighborhoods like bristle cone pines within a few miles, that's just the perfect example of extra money.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l", "qSentId": 10305, "question": "With neighborhoods like bristle cone pines within a few miles, that's just the perfect example of extra money.", "aSentId": 10306, "answer": "ugh...I use to go to many of these areas, and man I was like  \"someday, if I work real hard I could buy a mailbox here.\"\n\nI drive through them now to go to clients and such and it's just overwhelming...", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l", "qSentId": 10309, "question": "And that excuses a $600,000 locker room in a public school?", "aSentId": 10310, "answer": "Context.

We were like \"oh sorry, didn't mean to interrupt\" and the guy is like \"oh no problem come on in!\"  My buddy gives them each a beer and the guy asks us if we want to play beer pong.  We start setting up the cups and he asks us who we know at the fraternity.  My friend makes up a name and the guy says there is no one there by that name.  The situation went from very friendly to very aggressive instantly.  My buddy is trying to reason with him to let us stay and I am just like ' dude, let's just go, this is dumb and there are plenty of places to party\" the guy is like \" yeah you guys should go before something bad happens\" which is an obvious threat.  I am not a fighter at all and my buddy is just trying to be friendly and reason with the guy.  So I start walking out and as I make it on to the front porch I say something like \" Fuck this place these guys are lame\" and the guy grabs me and tries throwing me off the front steps so I grab him and we both end up going down.  We are wrestling on the ground for a few seconds and then all of a sudden there are like 10 guys on top of me while a few others are holding my friend back.  I finally managed to get away and to the sidewalk and then the treasurer (or someone like that) of the frat comes out and starts begging me not to call the cops, all the while his frat bros are on the porch yelling at us and talking all sorts of shit. He asks us what we want and I just tell him give us our beer back (we had come in with a 30 pack that they were now all drinking on the porch) we got it back and went home.  \n\nA couple years later I am dating a girl that goes to UofM and I am visiting her on Halloween.   I am walking back to her house from a party by myself and pass by the frat I was beat up at.  I notice a couple girls I was friends with in high school on the porch so stop by to say hello.  I am talking to them for about 1 or 2 minutes when someone knocks the hat off of my head.  I turn around and there are like 3 guys just standing there like waiting for me to do something.  I pick up my hat, turn to the girls and say \"Maybe I should go before something happens\" and the girls say \" yeah, these guys do that kind of stuff and if someone is going to get beat up tonight we would rather it not be you\" So I left.  For the record, I don't think they remembered me from years ago (the frat boys) I think they were starting shit with me again just because I was a guy they didn't know on their porch getting attention from girls they wanted attention from.\n\nTLDR: Got Beat up at UofM frat by a punch of sucker punching losers.\n\nBonus points if you can guess the Frat!", "aSentId": 12418, "answer": "So you attempt to crash a party, hurl an insult when told to leave, get your mouth shut for you and then you think it's ok to return?\n\n", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l", "qSentId": 12419, "question": "So you attempt to crash a party, hurl an insult when told to leave, get your mouth shut for you and then you think it's ok to return?\n\n", "aSentId": 12420, "answer": "I don't think he was crashing it.
