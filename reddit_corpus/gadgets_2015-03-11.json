Technical details are publicly available. Literally anybody can manufacture USB connectivity onto their products. You don't have to buy any special hardware from USB-IF for this. If you're an amateur hardware home-brewer, you're not going to care too much about PID collision and you can flip it around at random until you find one that works for your system. And anyone who's actually profiting from their USB-compliant products can afford to pay the absolutely trivial $4,000/year membership fee *or* the $3,500/2-year non-member licensing fee to be able to ship out non-colliding PIDs to their customers. This isn't an unreasonable requirement.\n\nThis is in stark contrast to Thunderbolt, which requires a proprietary controller that bridges the port itself with the appropriate PCI-e interface corresponding to whatever device you just plugged in. Both the controller and the firmware on it are closed black boxes. You have to get them from Intel, and then pay them exorbitant licensing fees. There is zero opportunity for amateur hardware development, and it makes no sense anyway for anybody outside of giants like Apple who have vertically integrated their entire product lineup.\n\nConsequently the \"open\" nature of USB is why the 3.1 standard with the C-type is quite likely going to oust Thunderbolt even on Apple products, and it's probably going to permeate the entire PC market in the next few years. We're going to see laptops with nothing but 4-5 C-type ports on them.\n\nMy main point is that we could have reached that point several years ago if USB wasn't this late to the party.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qgzt", "qSentId": 33705, "question": "&gt;At least the 3.1 spec will be a significant upgrade. 10Gbps will double the current theoretical usb 3.0 speed at 5gbps.

USB is several years late to this party. I wish that they weren't. If we had the new USB 3.1 standard *back then* that is PCI-e based like the Thunderbolt, and with a high power transmission for charging, we would have everything from MacBooks to Windows Ultrabooks shipping with pretty much nothing but USB 3.1 ports on it.
