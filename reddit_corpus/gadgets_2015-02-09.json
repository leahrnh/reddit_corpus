Something simple to set up and use. Here's some context:\n\nI work in an SMB and we just put up a TV on one of the conference room's walls. A TV was preferred to a projector because the room is pretty hard to get dark (lots of windows) and, honestly, we already had the 60\" TV laying around doing nothing. Cost is definitely a factor in the options I can bring forward to my boss.\n\nSo what we're looking for is a way to mirror (or better yet, extend) a desktop to the tv through an adapter of some sort, so that people can bring their laptops to the conference room and do presentations. We can't use wifi because most of our network features are disabled on it, notably server access (where people will have their files and resources).\n\nObviously, an HDMI cable would do the job but due to how the room and building are built, there's not really a way to run a cable from the TV to the conference table non-obtrusively.\n\nMy original idea was to hide a mini PC behind that TV and hook it up to the network using ethernet, with a wireless keyboard and mouse for control. The nice part of that is getting a full featured Win7 PC in there which would do all presentations we could want, play video, etc... but there are some downsides - it's relatively expensive (~400$ + additional Windows and Office licenses as most of our presentations are Office based), it introduces possible security issues (what kind of server rights and privileges do we give this PC? What if a manager wants to do a presentation with material that the PC can't access on the server?), it makes it complicated for a non-employee to use their own resources.\n\nSooo... ideally, really, what we want is a no hassle wireless HDMI adapter, I think. Bob brings his laptop, plugs this into his HDMI port and boom, extended desktop on the TV. No drivers, no config, no rights management. So I ask you /r/gadgets, does it exist? Does it *work*? Thanks!\n\nEdit to add, there will be no gaming and little video, this is mostly for basic stuff like documents, PDFs, some power points, etc. Delays and lag should be a non-issue unless it's catastrophic. Ideally it would carry audio as well but if that's not possible, I think we can live without it.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qgzt","qSentId": 31664,"question": "Weekly /r/Gadgets Advice Superthread!","aSentId": 31677,"answer": "Are there any 4k TVs worth getting that are not smart?
