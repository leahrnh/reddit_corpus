Now I live in the States and am always trying to spread the good word.\n\n1) A try is like a touchdown. In rugby, you must physically touch the ball down behind the goalline to score. It is worth 5 points and is followed by a 'conversion'. The conversion is like a PAT except that it is worth 2 points and must be kicked in line with where the ball was touched down for the try. This is typically kicked from a tee, though it can be drop kicked. It is therefore beneficial to score the try right between the posts rather than in the corner.\n\n2) See answer 1. A drop kick if attempted during open play is worth 3 points. There are also penalty kicks that can be aimed between the posts (like a field goal). Those are also worth 3.\n\n3) Rugby players can be considered in 2 groups. There are the forwards and the backs. The forwards are the big guys. The do a job similar to the O-line and D-line in football. The backs are the skill positions. They tend to be a little smaller and faster. They're generally still big though because they still have to tackle and break tackles. They don't get to come out when the other team has the ball and send in a defensive unit.\n\n4) There are definitely different styles amongst different teams. It's a little in depth to discuss right now, but somebody else might go in to it.\n\n5) Yes, there are set plays. You will notice them more easily after dead ball situations, but they are called during open play too. For instance, when the ball goes out of play across the sideline, there is a lineout. This involves players from both teams lining up facing the sideline and one player will throw the ball in. There will be strategy about where he throws it and tricks to make the other team think it will be thrown elsewhere. After the ball comes in it will either be taken in by one of the players or tapped back to a guy standing behind the lineout. There will be set plays on where they will run the ball, who he will pass to (backwards only), where dummy runners will go etc. That's just one example.\n\n6) African or European?\n\n7) Historically, the Southern hemisphere powerhouses (Australia, New Zealand, South Africa) have been seen as better than the Northern hemisphere. The World Cup has only been won by a Northern hemisphere team once (England in 2003).

With proper technique, even a small guy can lay out a big guy running at him.\n\nAlthough I've come to love american football in the time I've been living here, I really appreciate that rugby doesn't stop very often.

She was really nervous. Thankfully she didn't have to do much, the pitchers were pretty great that day, not many hits. It got to the 5th inning and time was about up and it was a close game - 3-1 the home team was losing, and they were at bat. First batter got a hit, and the next one up hit one right to the second baseman who grabbed the ball and tagged 2nd for the force-out. It was a fairly close play, but it was definitely an out.\n\nThe field umpire called the runner safe. Ooof.\n\nWe had been drilled by the head umpire during training every year to pretty much never overturn a fellow umpire's call, and this girl was already nervous as hell. The coach of the home team comes over to me like a bat out of hell asking me if I'm going to overturn the call. I tell him I'll talk to the other ump.

But a father... oh man... he tears out of the stands, hurdles a fence to get on the field and gets right in this 12-year-old girl's face and starts just screaming at her. I sort of expected someone to do something, possibly the coaches to pull this guy away... but I think everyone was just too dumbstruck. So, 16 year old me has to go out to confront this 40+ year old guy (who was a big, round man). Essentially I told him to get off the field, and out of the complex. He can wait in the car for the game to be over. He gets in my face and I just calmly say \"Sir, if you don't leave right now, your son's team will forfeit this game.\" He gets beet red and storms away. Complete silence at the field. I get back behind the plate and play continues.\n\nHome team goes on to score two, ties the game... and it ends that way. No extra innings in this league. We all shake hands and teams leave, girl umpire heads to the car where her parents are waiting. I collect the bases and make my way back to the umpire/equipment shed. The older umpires all had keys, so I set my stuff down and am fishing for the key in my pocket when I hear \"Hey asshole!\" Turn around, and guess who? The fence-hurdling-dad. Gets right in my face and starts screaming that I cost his kids team the game. I don't react and that made him even angrier.... He is waving his hands around and I see out of the corner of my eye the head of the ump group walking up (he also sits on the board of the little league - the only one in the area). I start to say \"Sir, please leave the premises,\" but I only get the \"s\" out before the moron pushes me as hard as he can. Right in front of the head umpire. Oh man, all hell broke loose. Head Umpire had that guy wrapped up so fast and someone else called the cops. Angry dad broke free and stormed away before police arrived, but by this point everyone knew who he was. I talked to the police, and they ended up talking to head ump and my father, who also sat on the board of the league. Decided not to press charges... but the guy and his kid were banned from the league forever, and threatened with trespass if they ever returned. AFAIK, they never did.\n\nPolicy changed the next year that all umpires must return to the shed together. I umpired one more year and then went away for school... but I will never forget that.

My first job was as an umpire for youth baseball/softball leagues in rural Michigan. I did this from 13-17 years old.\n\nWhen I was 16 (back in 1995), I was working behind the plate in a 11-12 year old game, and my field umpire was this younger girl - probably 13 - and this was one of her first games as an umpire. She was really nervous. Thankfully she didn't have to do much, the pitchers were pretty great that day, not many hits. It got to the 5th inning and time was about up and it was a close game - 3-1 the home team was losing, and they were at bat. First batter got a hit, and the next one up hit one right to the second baseman who grabbed the ball and tagged 2nd for the force-out. It was a fairly close play, but it was definitely an out.\n\nThe field umpire called the runner safe. Ooof.\n\nWe had been drilled by the head umpire during training every year to pretty much never overturn a fellow umpire's call, and this girl was already nervous as hell. The coach of the home team comes over to me like a bat out of hell asking me if I'm going to overturn the call. I tell him I'll talk to the other ump. We have a short conversation, basically me saying \"Was he out?\" She said yes. So I called him out. Coach just shrugged and walked away, like a normal human being coaching 11-12 year olds in a recreation league would do.

So I watched the Jazz play basketball, wrote down a couple screen plays and named them.  \n\nWe had an oversize dorky kid that could shoot free throws - but could not pass or dribble to save his life.  I created the 'Ostertag' play for him.  The guard would pass it to him, and curl off him while he pivot-screened the defender.  If both defenders followed the guard (or zone) he turned and made a free throw.  If the screen worked he passed the ball to the guard in a give-and-go play.  Worked amazingly well, over and over.\n\nOur guard (luckily for me) was a great passer, not the best shot but he garnered alot of attention as he looked great with the ball.  Our second play was the 'Stockton to Malone' and he and other kid, good passer - would basically head baseline and play keep away from the defenders until they had a low block shot.  It worked surprisingly well whenever I moved it to the left or right side of the court (by hollering) whenever I noted a weak defender on one side or the other.\n\nThe final play was the 'Hornacek' and basically we had one kid that could shoot the lights out of the three pointer (for a 10 year old) at probably 20-25% accuracy.  In youth sports, the kid was on fire alot at that percentage.  We would basically curl him from the top off 3 screens out to his favorite spot (baseline or dead center of the court) and this worked well with the 'Stockton to Malone' play; as we would set up for that play as a ruse.\n\nYou can tell I am not a basketball coach, as the terminology is a bit foreign to me.  We went undefeated 3 seasons, with very little to do with my coaching - just had good kids and a couple ringers in that age group.  But my boys had a lot of fun, and my oldest boy was the 'Hornacek' and enjoyed the spotlight and to this day will whoop my ass in horse with 3-pointers.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qgzy","qSentId": 1954,"question": "&gt; \"Dear parents, watching your kid play rec league basketball shouldn't be the most anger inducing part of your day. \"\n\nCan confirm.\n\nBoth of my young children play soccer and I coached my daughters team when she was 5-6.

The Clippers are soft and Blake Griffin is really a big baby who retaliates like a douche.  Last season I went to a Cavs vs Clippers game and Varejao was playing aggressive but clean, and he was covering Griffin.  Then at one point there is a clear call for a foul on Varejao but Griffin decides to just shove him to the ground anyway.  Some people who play sports get so used to whining that they actually don't care whether they get the call or not.  They condition it into a habit and it makes for a bad reputation that the refs (no matter what is said about them treating each game and each teams' players with a clean slate) take into account as to not let the game get away from their authority.
