I'd argue that the inconsistency of viewing angles introduced by curving the screen *for other viewers* makes it less desirable than a flat screen.  This, combined with the fact that LCD's are just... phenomenal these days... makes me think the curve (on televisions) is much more hype than technical achievement.  It's worth mentioning that this awesomeness of modern LCD's also mitigates the oddness of off-center viewing angles created by the curve.\n\nThe ONE thing about curved TV's that IS pretty cool is the depth enhancement feature - because the image is now rendered on a three dimensional shape rather than a two dimensional one, the onboard post processing can do some pretty cool stuff to create a sense of depth and immersiveness that a regular flat screen just can't.  That feature is growing on me, I will admit.\n\nI'm totally sold on curved desktop monitors.  Samsung had a nice, 27\" 1080P one featuring a VA panel that was VERY reasonably priced and that whole featureset is, like, complete to me.

So sitting off to the side of a curved screen will result in an uneven picture across the screen, while sitting to the side of a flat screen will result in an even picture across the screen (which will be not quite as good as sitting directly in front of the TV, but at least the whole image looks the same instead of being good on one side and bad on the other).  \n  \n  \nIf you ever watch TV with more than one person in the room, the curved TV is the wrong choice.

The mirror flips up when you go to take a picture. The downside to that is that mirror flipping up (other than a pellicle mirror, but that's more for the extremely curious) introduces a slight delay and shakes the camera slightly, which is problematic for long exposure.  There is a mode usually in the camera to mimic a mirrorless called Live View (at least for Nikon), and it makes the camera act like a mirrorless by flipping up the lenses and displaying the sensor output onto the back LCD display. Since the mirror sits in front of the sensor, the camera has to be longer in the body and can make it feel heavier due to the weight distribution. Remember though, good zoom lenses for either are typically heavy.\n\nMirrorless don't have a mirror and you look through a digital viewfinder (basically a small LCD that's magnified) to see what the SENSOR sees. That means if you're changing any settings (such as exposure time or concerns about shots being overexposed) you see the effect before you take the picture, which can be extremely useful. You'll see DSLR users look down after taking a picture, that's because they can't see the results in the viewfinder. With the mirrorless, you'll typically see the photo you just took in the viewfinder (some have options to speed it up, some may have the option of turning it off but not guaranteed). This has the advantage of instant feedback without having to reframe the shot, whereas the downside is that if you have something fast moving it makes it harder to find again. They're also extremely difficult for night shots (with some exceptions such as the a7s), since you see what the sensor sees and not what your eye sees. You may have difficulty pointing the camera in the right direction and confirming that the focus is even right. \n\nTl;dr traditional DLSR good for fast movement and low light, mirrorless good for smaller/lighter and instant feedback.

Many older individuals have weak plantarflexors (calf muscles) and offloading those muscle would likely only lead to more weakness, requiring more assist from the device. Simply strengthening those muscles would be more cost effective and practical. Also, elderly individuals commonly have dorsiflexion weakness, making it difficult for them to lift their toes while walking. This device would only make it more difficult to overcome that weakness, and increase their fall risk. \n\nAs far as achilles tendon injuries go, loading the tendon at the appropriate level is currently the best treatment approach.
