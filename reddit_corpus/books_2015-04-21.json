Thompson, The Proud Highway: Saga of a Desperate Southern Gentleman, 1955-1967\n\n\n\n\nHis Fear and Loathing quotes are great, but people often forget that was a satire laced with brutal sarcasm. A personal biopic on the LSD has-beens of the sixties failing to adjust to the new hippie culture of the seventies.\n\n\n If anything, it was a dire warning. Remember: Thompson killed himself in '05. He was burned out. Used up. He himself admitted it (and would probably not mind, and in fact appreciate, an honest appraisal of his untimely demise) \"Football season is over\" my ass. He left this plane right before the 2000s really got rolling. Internet vigilantism. The 99% protests. The police brutality issue. Thompson in his prime would have loved...no, *relished* what is happening now. The growing awareness of the people. The suspicion and paranioa all coming true. \n\n\nBut...Thompson never left the Fear and Loathing. He became an epitaph of his own book. His body endured, but his mind never left the 60s. I don't think he quite got over that. Not completely. Fear and Loathing was as close as he ever got to realizing it, but 30 years later he couldnt cope with that fact DESPITE being on the cusp of one of the greatest social upheavals since the 60s and 70s. \n\n\nI love HST. His works and his life with all my heart. His death was heartbreaking, and in the sense of study, it baffled me. How could this man EXPLODING with life let himself lose by throwing in the towel? But I began reading more. The Great Shark Hunt. Fear and Loathing in America. His letters and articles. His nonfiction.  And then---then I read Fear and Loathing again and it all made sense. Raul Duke saw it coming, even if Thompson didnt. As a work as a product of his life, Fear and Loathing is a warning. Buy the ticket, take the ride--sure. But there's another ride waiting. And another. And another. It never stops. It's just a different roller coaster with a different theme. And if you dont keep enough room for change in your pocket,  you might find yourself all spent and tired before the last ride even starts.

", "aSentId": 10926, "answer": "Agreed. And nor am I trying to color his works in any specific light, but rather give them a broader context than simply a work as a product of its time. Fear and Loathing, in the context of its time, was and still is intended as a sort of scathing review of the tumultous transition into the 70s. Paranioa and high strung conspiracy theories were becoming true. Things began moving in a whirl. \n\n\nI think we've moved past musing about quotes, nonetheless--\n\nA lot of younger counter culture lit enthusiasts (myself once included) often hold him in high regard as a \"go fast, go hard, no regrets\" when the truth is, just as you say, it was a fable on consequences and the direness of them. \n\n\nReally my point made is that Fear and Loathing has a lot more to do with coping with those consequences and trying to give a damn, and Thomspon's later life makes some tragic, if not ironic, parallels to the story. What can we make of the fact that the person who went the furthers, fastest, and hardest in the most brutal manner possible STILL eventually fell short and succumbed to very bar he set? \n\n\nWhat we can take from that is we should never give up. We should never stop fighting. Fear and Loathing has its own message, but studying the man behind the words give a deeper and more haunting context. It's certainly not neccesary, and most lit. scholars will argue that a work should stand alone in its meaning without the spirit of the author. I cant argue with that, I suppose, but I've never read any sterling reviews of *Mein Kampf* written by any sane person either. Sometimes the author gives significant context to the work. And Thompson, the brilliant, mad, and grim puppeteer behind Raul Duke, has quite a few lessons to teach beyond the confines of a single work, as I discovered in many of his other personal writings.

The universe he created is absolutely breathtaking. I read a lot of fantasy which wouldn't exist, or at least not in this form, without him.\n\nThat said: LOTR is the most boring book I ever read.  I couldn't finish it, i fought through the first book hoping it would get better, it picked up a little in the second book with all the fights going. At the beginning of book 3 I just realised that I really don't care about any of the characters and if whiny frodo will make it or not, so I stopped reading. To be honest I tried reading it when I was 15 and I just started reading books written in English. So a couple of years ago I decided to give it another shot, maybe the audiobooks are better, after half an hour listening to absolutely nothing happening I couldn't stand it anymore and stopped again. The movies are really well done, but I realized that the story is just not my cup of tea.\n\nIn the last few years talking with my friends about it I realised that the fact the reader knows about the ring and exactly knows what needs to happen with it takes away all the fun from the story for me. I fight through 1500 pages of just reading if he makes it or not. 2 years ago I asked my roommate who started another of his marathons, if Frodo makes it or not, and I had no emotion what so ever to the ending.", "aSentId": 13006, "answer": "I stopped with the introduction of Tom Bombadil.

McCarthy uses a couple of recurring themes in his works.  One of them is the physical presence of unstoppable evil.  The two examples that best illustrate this, that I can think of off the top of my head are The Judge from Blood Meridian and Chigurh from No Country for Old Men.  These men aren't devils in the sense that they inhabit a paranormal realm.  They are very real in our physical, secular world, and there's nothing we can do to stop them as they sow discord.\n\nThe other theme is this rooted, primal, desire to cross the line (both literal and figurative) towards our own destruction.  In Blood Meridian, the main character does it when he joins the filibusters.  In All the Pretty Horses, John Grady does it for to maintain his connection to the land (leaving Texas for Mexico) and love (staying in Mexico).  In the Crossing, Billy does it for a lot of different reasons and several times, but the result is always the same.  In No Country, Llewellyn does it for financial gain.  Who knows why the powers that be, do it in the Road, but the root cause is always the same, that man's desire hurdles towards our own demise.\n\nI believe that The Road is fundamentally misunderstood by the vast majority of its readers.  This isn't the fault of the readers, it's just an experience issue.  The tone, themes, and plot points of McCarthy's other works paint a much, much bleaker picture of the human condition than does the Road.  The Road was written in no small part due to the impact to McCarthy of having another son later in life.  The Road, although inspired by his earlier work in tone and style, breaks from tradition in that it is fundamentally a story of hope, love, and the promise of a better future.  Those themes are completely absent from his earlier works (I have not read his novels from before he won the MacArthur grant and moved to NM).  \n\nThe Road is about what it takes to be a father.  It's about completely giving yourself to your children, and giving them the promise of hope in their adolescence.  I read that book as I was about to become a father, I bought it for my dad as a Father's day gift, and I strongly encourage every father to be to read that book.  \n\nAt least for me, when my then girlfriend (now wife) was pregnant with our first I often asked myself what it was going to take to be a good father.  After reading the Road I figured it out: it takes everything.  If your child needs it, nothing cannot be sacrificed for their benefit.  \n", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh4i", "qSentId": 13468, "question": "The fact that he *immediately* started filling the tub with water seems to indicate that he had prior knowledge that something was about to happen.

The dull rose glow could be that from a nuclear attack.
