There was some experimentation with enslaving Indians, and the English even enslaved and traded Irish people for about 90 years in the 17th century, but by the time of the civil war, American slavery was all about black slaves (though importation of fresh slaves from Africa had long been illegal).\n\nRomans--and most other slavers--didn't care what your skin color was or where you were born (indeed, the modern notion of \"race\" and its attendant superior/inferior baggage did not emerge until about the 18th century). Slaves were typically originally captured in wars or raids, but the Romans were equally happy to make other inhabitants of that land full Roman citizens, as long as they accepted Roman authority.\n\nIt's worth noting that the Egyptians also did not enslave by ethnicity, and there is no historical evidence that they ever held any large number of Hebrew slaves. The pyramids and later monuments were built by well-paid voluntary workers.\n\nRoman slavery was also considerably more flexible than American slavery, there were more opportunities for slaves to work or buy their way out of slavery, and once they became free, there was not the inherent racial bigotry faced by free blacks in America.\n\nFinally, the Romans eventually learned an important lesson about slavery: it's bad for the economy. The Romans were such prolific enslavers that more and more of the work was being done by slaves, and free Roman citizens couldn't find jobs. They eventually had to pass laws that limited the amount of certain types of work--such as construction--that could be done by slaves.\n\n\n\n","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh53","qSentId": 10509,"question": "How did American slavery differ from Roman slavery?","aSentId": 10512,"answer": "In ancient Rome, rather than giving unwanted children up for adoption, you could just leave them out wherever and the slavers would come by and pick them up. \n\nAmerican Slavery was interesting because slaves were one color and freemen were a different color.

A one time pad is a cryptographic key that decodes a set code. The OTP would be used by one person who shifted letters in the alphabet to write a message. Another person had the key which showed how the letters associated with each other in the message. This gave them the way to solve the encryption. \nWhat made the enigma special is that it was random. An enigma machine would change the letter shift and ordering daily(this order had a specific key which was sent out to the german military each day) and commanders in the german military we're given the decryption key code. They would use a daily change in the order of a one time pad to send a message. This sucked for the allies because they only had 24 hours to decrypt messages before the encryption changed. What ended up happening is that a machine was recreated to predict the variable of change in the enigma machine. This machine operated very quickly for the time and dropped the decryption rate exponentially. So what would usually take hours and days ended up taking minutes.\n\nWhat it sounds like happened in the movie is that the Germans only changed this once a month, which was not the case. They received a ledger weekly or every other week and these we're highly protected. On top of that they changed it without notice for specific people and missions. It was as random as it could get at the time. Even if one was compromised it wouldn't interrupt the overall operation of the code because the allies didn't have an understanding of the machine itself\n\nI haven't seen the movie (but I really really want to) but that's basically what happened, it automated the decryption process\n\nAs a side note if you are interested in cryptography read the cryptonomicon by Neal Stevenson.
