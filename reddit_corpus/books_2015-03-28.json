It's a book that is at times funny, at other times poignant and tragic (much like John Green), and it's generally an easy and delightful read with substance as well as surface.\n\nIf you were willing to take a look at Austen (her relationships are great -coming from another dude- but I know what you mean; they're convincing, but are not of our era, and can feel rather stilted and retiring if not read in the right way: certainly nothing like so accessible as *The Fault In Our Stars*) you might be willing to look at other more classical novels. *Far From The Madding Crowd*, by Thomas Hardy, is a beautiful book, with easier language and engagement than Austen; it has the occasional tragic element, but is also simply very *nice*; the main character, Gabriel Oak, is so well done that empathising with him and wishing him well could not be easier, making the book as a whole extremely engaging. Or you could try a truly big gun like *Anna Karenina* (perhaps the most famous 'relationship' story ever), not for Anna's relationship but for that of Kitty and Levin, which is captivating; or, cranking it up another notch, *War and Peace*, which is crammed full of relationships, all of them utterly believable and entrancing, but also has- well, just about everything you could ask for from a novel.

Certain government functions *generate* a portion of their revenue through operations, for instance, a water system that bills it's customers.  Others generate no revenue whatsoever, like a city street, or a fire department.  This has less to do with lack of imagination, or even *potential* to generate revenue, than you might think; it's often a time-tested understanding of the best way to serve the public interest.  For instance, when fire protection first emerged it was fee for service.  You payed your bill and the FD stuck an emblem on your building.  Burning buildings without the emblem were left to burn to the ground.  What people learned was that (duh) untended fires spread to other buildings, including those with emblems.  And so, your great, great grandfather decided it served the public interest to require fire protection for everyone through taxation.\n\nThe historic understanding of libraries was quite similar.  Those who could afford to buy books already did so, but there was (and still is) a public interest in taking steps to ensure our country doesn't develop a permanent underclass of uneducated people with few opportunities to better themselves.\n\nIf you want to rent out some square footage that would otherwise be used for the purpose the taxpayers intended, that's fine, but I encourage you not to let your creativity supplant common sense.  $150K in rent is not going to keep a big urban library open.  Taxes keep them open.\n\nOur American ancestors weren't unimaginative, nor were they commies.

Our county had about 10 towns with little libraries like that, and a couple of bigger towns with bigger libraries, with maybe twice the operating costs - that's $1,008,000 for an itty bitty county which doesn't even have a proper *city*.\n\nHow many counties are in Missouri? To google I go! \n\n&gt;There are 114 counties and one independent city in the U.S. state of Missouri. \n\nOkay, so let's say all the libraries in the state combined have operating costs of $114,000,000.\n\nAbout half of that funding comes from federal and local (city/county) government.

It's that readers loss if they miss out on the full impact of the book. \n\n&gt; So, to the creators of this app who want literature sanitized to protect their daughter from exposure to uncomfortable ideas\n\nAccording to the article, it was the DAUGHTER who was upset about the content of the book. She didn't like whatever words it had that upset her. That gave her parents the idea--why not create an app that allows people to experience a book without reading whatever specific words they don't enjoy reading? They didn't force it on anyone. They didn't try to get schools to integrate it into their curriculum. They just offered an option for people to be able to enjoy works of art on their own terms. That only spread the influence of the art. ", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh4i", "qSentId": 12739, "question": "I think part of the perceived problem here is society's damnation of profanity.

If you are offended by the work do not approach the work. I don't want/need a 'fan' who can't handle my work. There is a bit of 'if you don't believe in science you shouldn't be allowed in hospitals' at play which I, frankly, agree with *conceptually* if not literally. Maybe it's harsh, maybe it's precious, maybe it feels discriminatory on some level, but it's how many many artists feel. When someone who appears to miss the point appropriates an artist's work in some way (see: Ted Cruz, \"RAtM fan\") it bothers them and, as mentioned in the article, it's actually against most US copyright agreements in many cases.\n\n\"If someone put pants on David they would call it vandalism.\" They used to say.  *Unless* Michelangelo specifically authorized it. As is the case with broadcast television and radio play. To use an example: when Quentin Tarantino signed a distribution deal with Touchstone regarding Pulp Fiction he authorized them to make whatever deals with whatever networks they liked because it just wasn't important to him which is how you get the hour long cut where you have literally *no clue* what happened in Zed's basement. Kurt Cobain, quite famously at the time, got flak for allowing the infamous 'Waif Me' to go out to stores in lieu of 'Rape Me' which he (allegedly) did specifically because the stores who carried the censored versions were the only stores he could afford to shop at as a child.\n\nMany films you will never see altered for television, however, because the filmmakers refused to submit to a random affiliate station in Utah being authorized to make their own cut of a film. While it's primarily due to the slow grinding death of cd *now*, years ago this was also true of why entire record labels would steer clear of certain stores which mandated censorship of album covers or other content.\n\nStill other artists not only submit to these acts of censorship but do so on the condition they can participate in them. They do this because, and this app is a great example to the contrary, this allows them to have creative input in the process. When a director contractually reserves final cut even though the studio mandates the rating they want it's because otherwise the studio can alter their film in an inexplicable or dubious way without their foreknowledge. The most famous case of this (in the name of marketing issues of all things iirc) is probably the \"Love Conquers All\" version of the Terry Gilliam film Brazil which was so out of step with Gilliam's initial vision as to be nearly unrecognizable altogether. Conversely, a director may reshoot a scene where people are clothed where they weren't before instead of losing the scene completely or decide that a censored version of a scene works so poorly in the narrative it is better off lost entirely. Many artists would rather compromise over having power over their work in *that* way than lose control over it entirely.\n\nYour white out/sharpie argument is fair for an *individual*. However there are a few issues specific to this app.\n\nFirst of all the censorship is automatic. This opens up a whole slew of literary issues. Passages can easily end up sounding like poorly retranslated rubbish. \"Why don't we hop in the bushes and I'll give you a pleasure.\" If I hadn't read the article I don't know wtf that's supposed to mean, which is the point I guess, but it sounds stupid to boot. The artist, even if they were so inclined, has no choice of involvement with that rewrite. Gun to their head they may have omitted that scene entirely rather than it sound so clumsy. What happens when there's consequences from that trist? \"I didn't know you could catch a disease from a pleasure I thought you could only get it from groin in bottom.\" Wtf is even happening here? A foul enough work (I'm looking at you, American Pycho) need not even bother with a censored version. The final auto-censoring would be utterly insane gibberish which, contrary to the opinion of many who are pro-censorship, it wasn't already just by virtue of the swearing and other nastiness.\n\nThe other major point is that, as appears to be the case according to the article, the app had its own shop function which the owner presumably profited from. If you are going to profit from altered work you'd better be doing it in accordance with the artist or their representatives which they were not doing. Somebody would have sued, on very firm grounds, if they hadn't complied voluntarily. True artistic control is an increasingly difficult battle to win since the advent of the Internet, obviously, but the minute you start turning a profit you're putting a tracking beacon on yourself for just this kind of scrutiny.\n\nThere was a time that not having your censored album in WalMart killed 70% of your potential revenue *easily* and some artists persisted because it simply didn't bode with their definition of art to do otherwise and that is their choice. Ray Bradbury was actually vocally opposed to abridged versions (and Reader's Digest in particular because of it) of books for similar reasons.

The article does not differentiate between e-readers and tablets and the data is pretty much useless without that distinction. For those who don't know, an e-reader is widely defined as something with an e-ink display, such as the Amazon Kindle or Nook from Barns &amp; Noble. An e-ink display is black and white and does not require a backlight. They can be read outside in direct sunlight and require a light source (built in with Kindle Paperwhite) if you are reading in the dark. Devices with e ink displays can last for days or weeks on a single charge and are not used for gaming, watching TV or other such apps. A tablet is widely considered to be something with a color video screen, such as an iPad or Kindle Fire. They require a backlight and are generally less easy on the eyes than something with an e-ink display.

That was *not* an insult.  It was an illustration of how much and how radically things can change.  We honestly thought at one time that was the greatest thing since sliced bread and was going to be the key to preserving all those old texts *in perpetuity.*  We couldn't know exactly how and why we were wrong about that at the time because that knowledge *simply did not exist.*\n\nWe have a lot of awesome and amazing new stuff right now.  All of which will be the punchline of \"Hey, Reddit, remember these\" jokes in ten or twenty years. \n\nWhy do I not want to trust my library to ebooks?\n\nAgain, a key point to me is ownership.  I will (because I don't really have a choice) accept \"licensing\" rather than ownership in places where I *have* to (say software).  But I don't have to with books because I *do* have a choice.

Of the people in this thread I was probably one of the earliest adopters of e-books.  I had a \"Rocket ebook\" sometime around 1995ish.

Some ebooks are more expensive than comparable paperbacks due to different licensing. Some ebooks are much cheaper, but those mostly apply to sales or to self-published books. I find that ebooks generally run 30% to 50% cheaper than the physical copy. \n\n&gt;you never have to worry about whether it's \"in stock\".\n\nUnless the publisher is having a conflict with whomever the seller is. Then the seller might yank all the ebooks from that publisher (this has happened with Amazon a couple of times). \n\n&gt; The feeling of reading. I understand this isn't necessarily logically justifiable but the aesthetic quality of a book is very different from that of an e-book.\n\nYou mean the feeling of breaking your wrist with a three or four pound novel from Brandon Sanderson? Or of trying to find a comfortable position to read from because the publishers thought it would be cute to publish the book in a non-standard size? \n\n&gt;It's difficult to flip back and forth between sections of a book - say an appendix or a notes section or an index etc. (Especially when pagination is affected by font size.)\n\nI can tell you haven't used an e-reader in the last couple of years. Flipping between pages is as easy as hitting the back button and many e-readers give the option of relative positioning (which is based on where you're at in the book), or positioning based on the page.\n\nFlipping a page is as quick as touching the screen. It's far quicker than turning the page of a physical book. Plus there's no risk that I'll accidentally catch the page on something and rip it (done that too many times), or get a paper cut (done that), or grab too many pages (done that). \n\n&gt;Loading books. I can just pick up a book and there is no buffer time at all.\n\nYeah, you haven't used an ereader in years. It takes less than 30 seconds (and that's *pushing* it) to download a book from any ebook store. If the book is already on the device pulling it up is almost instantaneous. \n\nPlus I can fit hundreds (if not thousands) of books on an ereader, and with the right apps I can actually have tens of thousands of ebooks on my computer at home and have them sent remotely to my computer. You can't do that with a physical book. \n\n&gt;Inability to mark-up the text.\n\nMy Kindle lets me mark up the text, highlight it with four different colors, save the notes, even see what *other* people have highlighted in the text. \n\nI really don't understand the fetishization that people have for paper books. \n\nPicking up a moldy Condensed Reader's Digest at a garage sale is supposed to bring me physical pleasure? Or a tattered paperback that's missing it's cover because it's been remaindered? Or even if it hasn't the cheap foil on mass market paperbacks is somehow supposed to make my senses glow?\n\nIt's one thing if you collect beautiful leather-bound books, or collect nothing but hardcover because they look good, or collect limited editions. Then I'd buy the arguments about the physical copy and the the way it looks or feels or whatever. \n\nYou left off several pros\n\n* Ease of storage. I no longer have six over-full bookshelves in my house. I'm down to just 2 1/2, and if there were ebooks available for the books on those shelves I'd have even fewer bookshelves. \n\n* The lower price point (even if it's only 30%), and the convenience in delivery means I buy far more new books than I used to, which means far more of my money goes to support authors than used to, as I used to almost exclusively buy used to get more bang for my buck. \n\n* Ebooks allow me to search the text, which is invaluable when I'm researching something in one of my many history books. \n\n* ereaders let me view pdf files\n\n* I can store my ebooks online and never worry about losing them all should my house flood or burn down. \n\n* I never have to worry about losing my bookmark and thus my place in the book. \n\n* I love the convenience of footnotes with ebooks. Just click on the footnote number and instantly I'm taken to that footnote. \n\n* Ebooks can embed hyperlinks. This is useful for more recent works which sometimes refer to webpages.\n\n* Ebooks have built in dictionaries in case I need to look up a word\n\nIt really seems like you haven't looked at an e-reader in three or four years at least.

I love the integration of the Amazon devices with the Amazon store, and since I buy quite a bit from Amazon (and have Amazon Prime too), it works for me.\n\nMy wife had a nook for many years. She actually really liked it, but the back end customer service from Barnes &amp; Noble was awful. Not that the people were, but the process to get anything done took forever. The biggest issues were for things like renewable subscriptions (such as magazines), or preorders for books, where if there wasn't money on your card on the day of the order then the item would go into a limbo state. You couldn't go into your account yourself to release the item, you had to call customer service to cancel the order and release it for you.\n\nIn addition, while both Amazon and B&amp;N have DRM on their books, with Amazon the DRM is tied to your account id. With B&amp;N it was tied to the credit card with which you purchased the item, which meant that if you removed that card from your account for any reason it could end up meaning losing access to that book.\n\nTo be fair, we bought a Kindle for my wife a little over a year ago, so maybe B&amp;N has fixed that part of their back end since then.\n\nAs to why I chose Amazon over Barnes &amp; Nobel originally\n\n* Amazon's selection was bigger then (and is still bigger)\n\n* Amazon's prices for their ebooks are generally lower (though not by much)\n\n* Amazon's market place in general is something I really like. As an Amazon Prime customer I get to borrow a free book a month from the Amazon library. For an additional monthly fee there's a significantly larger number of titles available to read without purchasing them (plus you can read more than one at a time). \n\n* Amazon's customer service is better.\n\nI do think that B&amp;N makes slightly better devices--but I don't think that the devices are so much better as to make it worth switching. For example for $79 with B&amp;N you can get an e-ink reader with built in backlighting. To get built in backlighting with Amazon will cost $119. \n\nFor the most part the devices are fairly comparable with each other. With B&amp;N you can go to your nearest B&amp;N and play with one. I know that my local Target carried a few Amazon devices but they were the tablet versions, not the e-ink versions. I don't know if all Targets will carry Amazon devices or not.\n\nBoth Amazon and B&amp;N will advertise that they have millions of titles in stock. These are mostly free or very cheap out of print \"classics\" that have been uploaded. I think that B&amp;N's magazine selection is probably better than Amazon's, but that's only a concern if you're going to be getting a tablet (magazines don't read very well on e-ink devices). \n\nThird party software for managing books works with most major devices. The most popular software by far is calibre. There's an app called \"calibre companion\" which allows you to remotely connect to your computer. I don't know if it's available from the B&amp;N app store or if that's even something you want to even try to mess around with. \n\nThere are other e-readers out there (such as Kobo), but I'd recommend going with either B&amp;N or Amazon simply because of the issues of compatibility. One other point to consider is that Amazon currently has something like 65% of the ebook market and it will probably get more. However that's a concern for future compatibility. Also the vast majority of new books (especially major ones) which are released in ebook format will be released in formats compatible with both Amazon devices and B&amp;N devices. \n\nOh, one other thing--many (most?) libraries also have options for lending ebooks too, in either format.

First of all, the type of books you read doesn't limit you to a certain reading format. Second of all, if by literature you mean \"classic literature,\" which I'm assuming you do because of your \"contemporary shit\" comment, a lot of classics and older books are actually free in ebook format because they're in the public domain, so an ereader would make a lot of sense for someone who likes to read mostly older books.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh4i", "qSentId": 14348, "question": "I feel like a true fan of literature would NEVER own an ereader.
