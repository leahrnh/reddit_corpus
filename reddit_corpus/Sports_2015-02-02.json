Running from the 1, he hardly has any time to get going.  Also, from watching the same game as you last night, I know that the Patriots had the box stacked in anticipation of a Lynch run.\n\nThe play call, while maybe not perfect, is far from the complete mind-fuck people are acting like it is.  Seahawks wanted to let the clock run down with just enough time to get off a couple plays for a TD and without enough time for Brady to mount a comeback.  So they let the clock run.  Then, probably to their suprise, Belichick didn't call a timeout.  Seahawks had only 1 timeout and taking it then would have meant running three quick plays in succession, with no timeout.  Seattle had a 3 receiver set on the field and the Patriots were loaded in the box against the run.  \n\nIf the pass completes, it's a TD and basically game over.  If it goes incomplete, they can take a timeout and have two plays for Lynch to try running it in.  But, unfortunately for them, it got picked.\n\nYou can argue against the execution of the call all you want:  Wilson should have thrown it lower, he shouldn't have led the receiver so much, he should have noticed Butler stalking him and thrown it away.  Maybe the play should have been a fade to the corner, so that if it goes incomplete the clock stops.  But, in general, a well executed passing play wasn't the \"biggest fuckup in Superbowl history\" like people are calling it.\n\nAs for amateur coaches, well, Carrol has 2 NCAA rings, a Superbowl ring from last year and was on the cusp of another this year.  I think I'll trust his judgement.\n\nedited to add:  If they ran all three attempts, there is big chance they don't actually get all three plays off.  The clock is running the whole time and at the end of each play, assuming no TD, you're going to have a bunch of Patriots players in the pile doing their best to make sure the Seahawks don't get up quickly.  Then they have to get the line set, snap the ball and run.  Personally, I don't see three running plays getting off in 25 seconds or 20 or 30 seconds.

If you recall the 30 second drive before half, you will remember they went for a td with 6 seconds to go, when they had an easy 3 right there for them. Most teams would have taken the 3 points, but not the Seahawks, because that is not how their game plan works. Same goes for their final drive where they made a questionable call that completely backfired. Had the play just before half backfired in the same way, you all would be bitching about that too. And before you all jump on me saying the last play is different because it would have sealed the win and was the obvious call, that is precisely my point. The Seahawks don't do the obvious thing, they are always looking for big plays. So for all of you to say it was a dumb call just because it didn't work is obscene, as most of their play calls could be called \"the dumbest call in history\" depending on the circumstances.

Why would only that play,  that interception make him realize that?

Also it's his job, she wasn't in labor and didn't show any signs of labor at that point. People aren't with their pregnant SO 100% of the time, people go to work all the time until their SO goes into labor, it's not that unusual. \n\nMaybe it was sarcasm and I missed it but IMO his reaction had nothing to do with his gf. I also don't think there is much evidence to it,  and it was reported that if his wife went into labor during the game or showed signs of labor he would head to the locker room immediately once the game was over (skipping the celebration  if they won,  also skipping interviews win or lose)  but he stuck around and did interviews rather than head off to be with his gf.  If he truly regretted missing times with his wife he would have skipped the interviews and such. I think him choosing to play was fine,  but if he decided to be with his gf that would be fine too.
