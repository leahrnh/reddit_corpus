This idea that because differences predated colonization, colonial powers could not be blamed for exacerbating tensions is inherently wrong.\n\nFirst, there is archaeological evidence to suggest that there were three separate groups that migrated to present-day Rwanda.  But there is an implication that these separate groups started ethnically homogeneous kingdoms.  This implication is false.  Races did not really exist in pre-colonial Rwanda.  Also, clans are not limited to Hutu or Tutsi.  Intermarriage has been common since the cohabitation of Hutu and Tutsi (2 plus millennial).  In these cases, ethnic identity is determined patrilineally.  Lineage lines are determined by tracing the male line of decedents.  In this case, that makes lineages confined to either Hutu or Tutsi.  However, all major clans in Rwanda have both Hutu and Tutsi in them.  Clan lines are traced to a common ancestor, and they have  nothing to do with being Hutu or Tutsi.  The truth is that if \"racially pure\" Hutu or Tutsi groups ever did exist, they have long since lost any purity through thousands of years of intermarriage.\n\nThe terms \"Hutu\" and \"Tutsi\", have been in constant flux since their birth. For the vast majority of pre-colonial history, \"Hutu\" was a term used for the masses, while \"Tutsi\" was used to denote who held power.  One could move between those two identities, not easily, but in a way that kept the classes fluid.   The reason that Tutsi have often been thought of as a group of herders is that they were. This is not because there was some biological tick in them that made them love herding.  It is not necessarily that Tutsi were herders, but that herders were Tutsi.  The reason being, in Rwanda there is a spiritual connection to cows, milk, and meat.  This meant that if one had cattle, their societal status was raised, thus making them Tutsi, generally speaking.\n\nUnder the reign of Mwami Rwabugiri (1853-1895), ethnic identities did tighten.  No longer could one move between the two classes. Corvee labor was imposed on the Hutu who, by nature, were out of power.\n\n  A biologic difference between Hutu and Tutsi did at one time exist, but two millennia of cohabitation and intermarriage has made biologic differences disappear, or at the very least irrelevant.  And while Rwabugiri did tighten the definitions of \"Hutu\" and \"Tutsi\", colonial rulers did much more to solidify the \"races\"\n", "aSentId": 47013, "answer": "Enter European Colonialism:\n\nRwanda was first colonized by Germans immediately prior to the turn of the twentieth century and later succeeded by Belgium after Germany was forced to cede its colonies following the First World War.  Both pursued a \u201cdivide and conquer strategy\u201d of pitting the two \u201craces\u201d, Hutu and Tutsi, against one another.  Belgium was distinctly effective at pushing the \u201cseparate races\u201d initiative.  The Hamitic Hypothesis (more on this below) became the basis for class division and establishing a group of indigenous Rwandans that could serve the greater interests of Belgian colonialism.  This took hold in the education system that was primarily run by Catholic Missionaries.\n\tThe Catholic Church officially supported the Hamitic Hypothesis and the interests of the Belgian colonizers.  They submitted race reports to the Belgian colonial authorities that noted the difference in civility between the Hutu and the Tutsi.  The latter were seen as \u201csupreme humans\u201d in contrast to the uncouth and boorish Hutu.  Primary education was offered to both Hutu and Tutsi, but Tutsi were taught in French and Hutu taught in Kiswahili.  Secondary education was only offered to Tutsi.  Catholic missionaries instilled a sense of inferiority in Hutu populations by professing the belief that nomadic Tutsis had invaded Rwanda; asserted their dominance by killing Hutu chiefs; and enslaved the Hutu population.\n\tThe results of this indoctrination of the Hamitic Hypothesis in Rwandan schools can be seen even in contemporary Rwanda.  A series of Rwandan generations grew up with the idea that there was a biological difference between themselves and their neighbors.  This biological difference made one group more suitable for holding political power and the other doomed to menial and, sometimes, forced labor.  Catholic education was wrought with \u201cdiscriminatory practices [and] racial myths\u201d that supported structural racism.  This was the point in Rwandan ethnic identity construction that the Hamitic Hypothesis became a fact for the Rwandan people.  It came to define who they were and what they were destined to do.\n\tIn addition to the ethnic rift created by colonial education, the Belgian colonizers pursued a policy to \u201cracialize the local authority\u201d.  This was a ploy to make local officials directly and solely responsible to their colonial overlords.  This included de-emphasis of the monarch and a wholesale replacement of all Hutu local officials with Tutsis.  This shift in power facilitated the resurrection of corv\u00e9e labor.  Tutsi chiefs were directed to submit their Hutu constituency to forced labor aimed at building or supporting colonial infrastructure and producing cash crops, specifically coffee.  By stripping the Hutus of any semblance of power and creating an indoctrinated group of subservient indigenous colonizers, the Belgians had created an elite to rule over exploited laborers.\nThe 1933 census was conducted by the Belgians and divided the Rwandan population into four categories: white, Tutsi, Hutu, and Twa.  This census, once and for all, defined who was Tutsi and who was Hutu.  It factored in traditional associations of Tutsi ownership of cows, church information, and physical measurements to divide the indigenous population into roughly 85% Hutu and 15% Tutsi.  All indigenous people were given identity cards.  Future ethnicity was to be determined patrilineally, thus solidifying ethnic identity through biological determinants.\nDuring colonialism, what it meant to be Tutsi or Hutu changed.  Eugenics and the Hamitic Hypothesis were evident in colonial manipulation of the Rwandan people.  The fluidity of precolonial ethnicity allowed \u201cTutsi\u201d to be synonymous with power.  Colonialism shifted this dialogue from Tutsi are power to Tutsi have power.  This change is subtle but significant.  One reason why ethnic violence was non-existent prior to 1959 was that for most of precolonial Rwandan history, ethnic classes were permeable.  Thus, one could obtain power no matter what class he or she was born into.  Colonialism\u2019s biologic interpretation of class disallowed identity redefinitions.  Once born into an ethnicity, one could not escape the title.  This biological interpretation of ethnicity allowed animosities to ferment.  The majority of the population was subject to forced labor until 1949, and even after its abolition Hutu farmers experienced significantly more oppressive taxation than their Tutsi counterparts.  Eight-five percent of the population was being oppressed by fellow Rwandans.  Soon Hutus came to see Tutsis, not as their neighbors, but, as a foreign people that invaded Rwanda.  Tutsis were seen in the same light as the Belgian colonizers.  Hutu discontent with Tutsi and a public education system designed to create a racial cleavage, made Rwanda ripe redistribution of power upon Belgian withdrawal.\n\nSo, sorry to be that dick who cares too much, but I felt like half the story was being told.\nBelow is a synopsis of the Hamitic Hypothesis:\nThe Hamitic Hypothesis is one of the most dynamic, elaborate, malleable, and laughable explanations that academic eugenicists produced.  A brief history behind the Hamitic Hypothesis is necessary to understand how it came to be applied to colonial Rwanda.  In one Biblical story, Noah (same Noah who built the arc) became very drunk one day, and as his children tried to clothe him one did not avert his eyes.  This son was Ham. When Noah learned Ham had seen him unclothed, Noah cursed Ham\u2019s son, Canaan.\n\tThere is another passage in the Bible that describes the people of Africa as Kushites.  It was popularly believed, in Europe, that the Kushites were black, even though this is not mentioned anywhere in the bible, and that they were the descendants of Ham\u2019s other son, Kush.  The myth was then manipulated further to proclaim that all of Ham\u2019s sons were cursed by Noah.  This skewed interpretation of the Biblical myth provided the justification for the enslavement of Africans on the basis that they were cursed by divine ordainment.\n\tDuring the Napoleonic invasion of Egypt, Europeans were exposed to an African culture that appeared to have all the trappings of an advanced civilization.  This did not sit well with eugenicists who argued that a hierarchy of races established that Caucasoid people were more advanced than Africans.  The Hamitic Hypothesis was again used to quell European consciences.  This new interpretation declared that the Egyptians who possessed the intellect and capability to make such wonders as the pyramids at Giza, were the descendants of Ham\u2019s son Mizriam.  This time the myth took a more accurate interpretation of the Bible by recognizing that only Canaan was cursed by Noah.  The blood line and phenotype of the presumed Caucasoid Mizriamites then became diluted through centuries of intermarriage with native peoples.  This dilution of the \u201cpure\u201d Mizriamites with indigenous blood was postulated by John Hanning Speke and propagated by Charles Gabriel Seligman.\n\tWhen the German colonizers first arrived in Rwanda they found that Tutsi held the highest positions of state and that Hutu must be subservient.  They then inferred that there must be a biological difference between the Hutu and the Tutsi.  European intellectuals had become well acquainted with the work of Joseph Deniker, who attempted to map European racial boundaries.  He also described the phenotype of the \u201cKushite-Hamites\u201d as \u201ctall, aquiline nose, nomadic populations\u201d that could be traced back to Ethiopia.  Tutsi were thought to be Hamitic.  They had invades from the north and possessed stronger martial skills and were more civilized than the indigenous Bantu people.  Years of intermarriage had changed the color of their skin to black, but not as black as their Hutu neighbors.\n\tTo ensure that the white colonizers would remain in power, the traditional Rwandan myth of the Bimanuka was redefined to make it appear as if the divide between Hutu, Tutsi, and Twa had historical precedence and was divinely ordained.  This new myth followed a Rwandan Mwami (King) who wanted to see which one of his sons was fit to rule.  He decided that his son Gatutsi was the most noble and that he would rule over the \u201cgluton serf Gawa\u201d and the \u201cclumsy peasant Gahutu\u201d.  This new interpretation of the myth established Tutsi as the economic, political, and social rulers of all the \u201craces\u201d of Rwanda.  Yet again we can see that the definition and the characteristics of Rwandan social categories were not innate, but a manipulation of traditional Rwandan and Biblical myths and quasi-science so that the elite could impose an identity upon Rwandans.  Mamdani suggests that a political identity can be defined as a group whose social category is recognized and fostered by the state.  Social categorization of Hutu and Tutsi during the colonial period can best be described as political identities that colonial powers imposed upon the masses.  The terms used to define one\u2019s group was the same, but the characteristics that defined each group had changed drastically.  One\u2019s status as a member of either group was a result of one\u2019s phenotype, the Hamitic Hypothesis, and an identity card that was issued by state authorities.  This myth has come to be the single most important identifier of social category in Rwanda over the last century.  One can observe this in the actions of g\u00e9nocidaires who, in 1994, threw the bodies of murdered Tutsi into the Nayabarongo River, which is a tributary of Lake Victoria.  Lake Victoria is the source of the Nile.  So, by discarding the bodies of the Tutsi into the Nayabarongo, the g\u00e9nocidaires were returning the Tutsi to their northerly origin.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh53", "qSentId": 47017, "question": "&gt;  The ethnic divisions were not set in stone; a Hutu for instance could become a Tutsi by accumulating wealth or influence.

Today they are both proud members of the EU.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh53", "qSentId": 47037, "question": "Ruanda-Urundi (now the separate countries of Rwanda and Burundi) is an interesting case of a colonized country in the region, because unlike other territories nearby, such as Congo, Tanzania, and Uganda, it was a remarkably unified entity prior to German and subsequent Belgian rule. Rwandan Mwamis (kings) ruled a centralized Kingdom for a long time before the Belgians came along, which made it easier for them to rule indirectly through the local chiefs. \n\nThis is important to understand, because unlike what /u/nathan346 claims on this thread, Hutus and Tutsis were not really separate 'tribes' in the sense that, for instance, Buganda and Banyankole are in Uganda. \n\nHutus (about 90% of the population), Tutsis (about 10%) and Batwa (%1 or less) in Rwanda and Burundi spoke and speak the same language of Kinyarwanda/Kirundi, and while there are areas with higher and lower concentrations of each ethnic group, they can be found throughout both countries. In terms of religious affiliation, there was and is also no clear distinction between the groups. Even today, Rwanda is one of the few countries in Africa where one native language is spoken exclusively and universally by all citizens.\n\nThe extent and nature of the differences between the Hutus and Tutsis prior to the Europeans is hotly debated. The current Rwandan regime likes to argue that 'Hutu' and 'Tutsi' were merely social markers - they were fluid categories that reflected social status; Tutsis were those who owned a significant amount of cattle, Hutus were peasants, and Twa created pottery, and individuals moved between the social groups through fortune or marriage. According to this historiography, the Belgians came in with racist preconceptions, created the 'Hamitic myth' that Tutsis were descendents of a superior Ethiopian/Egyptian race while Hutus were inferior Bantus, and as a result racialized and bureaucratized a harmonic society with different social groups into an oppressive apartheid state with Tutsis given the tools and mythology to oppress the Hutu.\n\nOn the other hand, recent genetic testing has confirmed that Tutsis and Hutus have distinct markers, which show that modern Tutsis likely do have more descendents from the Nilotic region. My Rwandan friends also tell me that, more often than not, they can still tell (former - the Rwandan state has criminalized the use of the words in many ways) Hutus and Tutsis apart on sight. However, historical anthropologists have confirmed that the groups were more fluid prior to Belgian involvement, and while there is evidence of historical oppression by the Tutsi against the Hutu in the form of indentured labour, it's clear that the Belgians escalated the situation for their own benefit and through their own bias - widespread violence or feuds did not exist until the post-colonial era.\n\nAnother important point of 'blame' for Belgium has to do with the events leading to the emergence of the independent nation of Rwanda. Again unlike any other African state, Rwanda emerged from dependence through a bloody social revolution. Where colonial Belgium continuously propped up the Tutsi as a racial class for their own benefit, the moment the Belgian religious and administrative elite in Rwanda and Belgium sensed that their grasp on control of the region was slipping, they started to support the idea of a 'demographic imperative' - a right to rule for Hutus based on their majority. As a result, the Hutu dictatorships of Kayibanda and Habyarimana were propped up again by the Europeans, first the (former) colonial power, and later France, who considered it within their sphere of influence as part of Francophone Africa.\n\nLike the Tutsi elite before them, the Hutu dictatorships continued to escalate tensions between the (now?) ethnic groups. In times of economic hardship, the Hutu rulers often turned to the richer Tutsi citizens as scapegoats. Stereotypes invented or embellished by the Belgians at the time of colonialism - Tutsis are intelligent and noble, Hutus are submissive and unintelligent - persisted, but were inverted by the new elites: Tutsis are scheming and arrogant, Hutus are honest and hard-working. \n\nAll these are very important ultimate factors which determined the devastating outcome. The proximate causes of the genocide in 1994 are another, complex, story altogether, and something I could write much more about. However, Belgian influence waned after the early 1960ies, and I think it can be said quite conclusively that, even if a violent reckoning could not have been avoided, the nature and extent of the violence in the subsequent decades, culminating in a genocide where **every member**, including women, the elderly, and children, of the one group was targeted for destruction, can be traced back directly and absolutely to the relatively brief period of Belgian rule.\n\n-------------------\n\nAs a PS - you mention religious strife in Rwanda. One interesting aspect of Rwandan society today is that there is a significant muslim minority (about 5-10%) and a very fractured Christian landscape of Catholics and several protestant denominations, living side by side with no recorded instances of religious violence.\n\nReligion did play an important role during the genocide. Many Tutsis fled instinctively to their respective house of worship. Most Christian Tutsis met their maker as a result - by concentrating themselves they became easy targets of the killers, who often included their own religious leaders. Many Muslim Tutsis, however, survived because (Hutu) Muslim leaders saw their religious identity as superceding their ethnic identity - they protected their flock at considerable risk, instead of murdering them.\n\n\n*I would also recommend asking this kind of question over at /r/askhistorians next time.

", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh53", "qSentId": 47037, "question": "Ruanda-Urundi (now the separate countries of Rwanda and Burundi) is an interesting case of a colonized country in the region, because unlike other territories nearby, such as Congo, Tanzania, and Uganda, it was a remarkably unified entity prior to German and subsequent Belgian rule. Rwandan Mwamis (kings) ruled a centralized Kingdom for a long time before the Belgians came along, which made it easier for them to rule indirectly through the local chiefs. \n\nThis is important to understand, because unlike what /u/nathan346 claims on this thread, Hutus and Tutsis were not really separate 'tribes' in the sense that, for instance, Buganda and Banyankole are in Uganda. \n\nHutus (about 90% of the population), Tutsis (about 10%) and Batwa (%1 or less) in Rwanda and Burundi spoke and speak the same language of Kinyarwanda/Kirundi, and while there are areas with higher and lower concentrations of each ethnic group, they can be found throughout both countries. In terms of religious affiliation, there was and is also no clear distinction between the groups. Even today, Rwanda is one of the few countries in Africa where one native language is spoken exclusively and universally by all citizens.\n\nThe extent and nature of the differences between the Hutus and Tutsis prior to the Europeans is hotly debated. The current Rwandan regime likes to argue that 'Hutu' and 'Tutsi' were merely social markers - they were fluid categories that reflected social status; Tutsis were those who owned a significant amount of cattle, Hutus were peasants, and Twa created pottery, and individuals moved between the social groups through fortune or marriage. According to this historiography, the Belgians came in with racist preconceptions, created the 'Hamitic myth' that Tutsis were descendents of a superior Ethiopian/Egyptian race while Hutus were inferior Bantus, and as a result racialized and bureaucratized a harmonic society with different social groups into an oppressive apartheid state with Tutsis given the tools and mythology to oppress the Hutu.\n\nOn the other hand, recent genetic testing has confirmed that Tutsis and Hutus have distinct markers, which show that modern Tutsis likely do have more descendents from the Nilotic region. My Rwandan friends also tell me that, more often than not, they can still tell (former - the Rwandan state has criminalized the use of the words in many ways) Hutus and Tutsis apart on sight. However, historical anthropologists have confirmed that the groups were more fluid prior to Belgian involvement, and while there is evidence of historical oppression by the Tutsi against the Hutu in the form of indentured labour, it's clear that the Belgians escalated the situation for their own benefit and through their own bias - widespread violence or feuds did not exist until the post-colonial era.\n\nAnother important point of 'blame' for Belgium has to do with the events leading to the emergence of the independent nation of Rwanda. Again unlike any other African state, Rwanda emerged from dependence through a bloody social revolution. Where colonial Belgium continuously propped up the Tutsi as a racial class for their own benefit, the moment the Belgian religious and administrative elite in Rwanda and Belgium sensed that their grasp on control of the region was slipping, they started to support the idea of a 'demographic imperative' - a right to rule for Hutus based on their majority. As a result, the Hutu dictatorships of Kayibanda and Habyarimana were propped up again by the Europeans, first the (former) colonial power, and later France, who considered it within their sphere of influence as part of Francophone Africa.\n\nLike the Tutsi elite before them, the Hutu dictatorships continued to escalate tensions between the (now?) ethnic groups. In times of economic hardship, the Hutu rulers often turned to the richer Tutsi citizens as scapegoats. Stereotypes invented or embellished by the Belgians at the time of colonialism - Tutsis are intelligent and noble, Hutus are submissive and unintelligent - persisted, but were inverted by the new elites: Tutsis are scheming and arrogant, Hutus are honest and hard-working. \n\nAll these are very important ultimate factors which determined the devastating outcome. The proximate causes of the genocide in 1994 are another, complex, story altogether, and something I could write much more about. However, Belgian influence waned after the early 1960ies, and I think it can be said quite conclusively that, even if a violent reckoning could not have been avoided, the nature and extent of the violence in the subsequent decades, culminating in a genocide where **every member**, including women, the elderly, and children, of the one group was targeted for destruction, can be traced back directly and absolutely to the relatively brief period of Belgian rule.\n\n-------------------\n\nAs a PS - you mention religious strife in Rwanda. One interesting aspect of Rwandan society today is that there is a significant muslim minority (about 5-10%) and a very fractured Christian landscape of Catholics and several protestant denominations, living side by side with no recorded instances of religious violence.\n\nReligion did play an important role during the genocide. Many Tutsis fled instinctively to their respective house of worship. Most Christian Tutsis met their maker as a result - by concentrating themselves they became easy targets of the killers, who often included their own religious leaders. Many Muslim Tutsis, however, survived because (Hutu) Muslim leaders saw their religious identity as superceding their ethnic identity - they protected their flock at considerable risk, instead of murdering them.\n\n\n*I would also recommend asking this kind of question over at /r/askhistorians next time.

This in turn essentially germanified Europe since the end result of the process essentially had all former cultures merged with the Germans or eradicated by the Germans and other threats.  Mostly the former.  There were still some Germanic tribes in what we define as modern day Germany from what I recall, but it was primarily run over by the Huns or other tribes the Huns forced west who in turn forced the Germans from their ancestral homelands.\n\nSo in short, no, modern day Germany was not really all that Germanic in the earlier part of that time period, instead most of Europe (think Roman Empire) was turned Germanic.  North Africa was germanified as well (vandals).  The eastern half of the empire was less effected, however the goths did do some germanizing of everything outside of Constantinople.\n\nTldr: If you're white, you're German", "aSentId": 47190, "answer": "There were a few small enclaves of Celts that weren't immediately overrun by Germans.
