I, too, really liked ***Maps To The Stars***.  I actually think it may be Cronenberg's most mature and best crafted film (outside of his \"Body Horror\" masterpieces ***Dead Ringers*** and ***eXistenZ***).  I think it just edges out the great ***A History of Violence*** for the simple reason that it avoids genre tropes completely --even to subvert them-- which, to my mind, makes it more original.  I think building a Hollywood story around the theme of *incest* says volumes about America's current \"inbred\" mental and spiritual state (how media and the internet are making the *world* into a small town, where *everybody* thinks they know your private business):  Reflecting crucial ideas about Hivemind, Gossip, P.R., \"the News,\" the delusions and true extents of \"Insider Power,\" manipulated zeitgeist, the Old Boy Network, the predominance of Youth Culture (including the roots and dangers of systemic pandering to that power block), the birth and corruption of trends, the entropic nature of \"the sins of the Fathers\" (and mothers), the desperate need for and fear of \"secrets,\" and so much more.  And I thought it was populated by a range of people who were not only a shrewd microcosm of archetypes, but who also became empathetic by showing themselves to be as sincere and emotionally deep as they are hypocritical and intellectually dishonest.

Damn near *central* to his character, in fact. And if you want to add in that he's adopted, it's doable, but it changes the character and changes the dynamic.\n\nAs for \"playing the race card\": ha. I even specifically said that Mister Fantastic would make more sense as a black man, so clearly I'm not fundamentally opposed to black actors being cast in roles that were white in previous variations of the work.\n\nI don't question Idris Elba being cast as Heimdall (except that it means he can't really play any *other* of Marvel's black characters and have a *bigger* role) because Elba is a great actor and he plays the part well, and frankly his skin tone isn't in any way important to his character. It's a little odd, given Asgard characters' Norse origins, but then, we are talking about stories that got told and re-told through the ages by mostly white men, so it seems entirely possible... and that's if you want to nitpick something relatively inconsequential about a relatively minor character.\n\nYou know what would have been less pandering? Making both Johnny Storm *and* Sue Storm black. But no, they're just race-lifting one of them. Why? Because tokenism.\n\nAnd that's what you're defending right now: tokenism. So you tell me: Were there not any talented black actresses to play Sue Storm? It would have made the movie make more sense than it does currently, *without* the need for extra exposition explaining things - and a white family adopting a black child, or vice versa, might not be unheard of, but it's uncommon enough that it sticks out like a sore thumb and the law of conservation of detail requires both that it be addressed and have some relevance to the plot.\n\nComic fans are wary of having their stories messed with in a fundamental way. But if it makes sense, then sure, why not. Making Peter Parker black, for example, would be an odd choice, since there already *is* a black Spider-Man, Miles Morales. It would be doing a disservice to a black character who would be more fitting for the role, if that's the direction they wanted to take it anyway. I bet you anything that comic fans would react poorly to a black Peter Parker, and well to a black Miles Morales, even though they're both the goddamn Spider-Man.\n\nBy the same token (ha, token), comic fans would rightly be upset if Professor X was re-cast as a black man, both because Patrick Stewart is so clearly ideal for that role, as well as the fact that the entire X-Men franchise is intended as an analog for the Civil Rights movement, and recasting the professor as black kinda' hits the nail too much on the head.\n\nOh, and *speaking* of being ideal for the role, Johnny Storm is brash, impetuous, immature, and hot-headed. You know who that *doesn't* sound like? Michael B. Jordan's character in Chronicle. The fact that both characters are superpowered humans means precisely squat.\n\nI think Jordan is a great actor, and would absolutely like to see him play a character in a real superhero movie. Hell, if we're looking at traditionally white characters he could play, he'd make an excellent Nova or Iron Fist.

In a way, Batman's main role in the films is as a mechanism to explore the antagonists.  R'as al Ghul in *Batman Begins* was probably the closest the trilogy got to establishing a significant dynamic character relationship, where both protagonist and antagonist feed off each others' actions to form a sort of dialogue.\n\nIn the second and third movies, Joker and Bane are the primary focus; exploring their origins, creating situations where their personality manifests, and essentially reducing Batman to a \"walking camera\" that captures the machinations of each villain.\n\nAfter Batman Begins, the only time I can think of that really explores Batman's history, personality, and development in a significant way is, ironically enough, in *Dark Knight Rises*; when him and Alfred part ways after a series of emotional scenes.  Additionally, the subplot where Batman goes to The Pit is also intended to be character development, but I personally did not enjoy that part of the movie.
