It's the one thing preventing me from buying a 3DS. ","aSentId": 618,"answer": "Well, *kind of*. Your cheap phones have a screen that's, what, 960\u00d7540? Since that's the resolution of the [Samsung Galaxy Avant](http://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_avant-6542.php), and since that's that's one of T-Mobile's bargain phones, I'm rolling with it. That's [about half a megapixel](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=960*540).\n\nNow, the 3DS lower screen is 320\u00d7240, and the upper screen is pushing 800\u00d7240 (two 400x240 displays, one for each eye). This comes out to [about a quarter of a megapixel](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28320*240%29%2B%28800*240%29). Sounds puny, but consider what else the New 3DS has under the hood: a quad-core ARM11 MPCore at 268MHz per core, and the old DMP PICA200 as a GPU (though with more VRAM and twice the clock speed).\n\nThis is in stark contrast to the Cortex-A7 at 1.2GHz per core mated with an Ardeno 302 in the Galaxy Avant. So the Galaxy Avant has a lot more power to drive that qHD display. On the other hand, it's only rendering one display and it doesn't need to make 3D depth calculations.\n\nSo the display is likely being held back by the relatively anemic CPU/GPU pair that Nintendo is rolled up in the N3DS. And they're kind of stuck with those platforms, as making too many changes would break backwards compatibility even more than these changes already have. And let's not forget that the autostereoscopic screen is eating into system overhead, now that the CPU has to be tracking your eyes relative to the position of the screen in space and the system has to make a lot more on-the-fly adjustments to the screen. Beyond that the 128MB of RAM and and 6MB of VRAM doesn't help things, especially to the Galaxy Avant's 1.5GB of RAM.\n\nBut here's the thing, let's say we make some tiny changes to the New 3DS displays, and bump the resolutions up one tiny increment. So the lower screen is [426\u00d7320](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=480%2F320), and the upper screen is now [1066\u00d7320](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28%28320%2F9%29*15%29*2). A scant 80 pixels vertical increase and a proportional horizontal increase. You're now pushing [pretty close to half a megapixel](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28426*320%29%2B%281066*320%29), much like the Galaxy Avant.\n\nSo to be honest, the performance Nintendo is wringing from this hardware is pretty impressive. This is mostly because of the close-to-the-metal coding and by-hand optimization developers can make because there's just one 3DS spec (well, now there's two) compared to Android where everything is in Java and needs to be compiled on the fly. But unless Nintendo makes a big bump in the hardware, increasing the resolution is difficult to do because it's an [exponential](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=x^2) increase in the number of pixels.\n\nThe other side of the equation to consider is that the Galaxy Avant had a launch price of $199, locked to a carrier (which means T-Mobile is likely building some of the cost of that phone into your service fee), using readily available TFT displays, mass market Snapdragon 400 SoCs, and an OS that Samsung has to spend very little money on. Meanwhile Nintendo is meeting that same price point, but using customized chipsets, customized data interfaces (for the cartridge slot), the autostereoscopic screen (which means including the face tracking camera too), and an OS that they not only need to developer and update, but distribute (as OS updates and in dev kits) as well. That all cuts deeper into the overhead than what Samsung is cramming into a bargain basement phone.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qgzt","qSentId": 619,"question": "Well, *kind of*.

So the lower screen is [426\u00d7320](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=480%2F320), and the upper screen is now [1066\u00d7320](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28%28320%2F9%29*15%29*2). A scant 80 pixels vertical increase and a proportional horizontal increase. You're now pushing [pretty close to half a megapixel](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28426*320%29%2B%281066*320%29), much like the Galaxy Avant.\n\nSo to be honest, the performance Nintendo is wringing from this hardware is pretty impressive. This is mostly because of the close-to-the-metal coding and by-hand optimization developers can make because there's just one 3DS spec (well, now there's two) compared to Android where everything is in Java and needs to be compiled on the fly. But unless Nintendo makes a big bump in the hardware, increasing the resolution is difficult to do because it's an [exponential](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=x^2) increase in the number of pixels.\n\nThe other side of the equation to consider is that the Galaxy Avant had a launch price of $199, locked to a carrier (which means T-Mobile is likely building some of the cost of that phone into your service fee), using readily available TFT displays, mass market Snapdragon 400 SoCs, and an OS that Samsung has to spend very little money on. Meanwhile Nintendo is meeting that same price point, but using customized chipsets, customized data interfaces (for the cartridge slot), the autostereoscopic screen (which means including the face tracking camera too), and an OS that they not only need to developer and update, but distribute (as OS updates and in dev kits) as well. That all cuts deeper into the overhead than what Samsung is cramming into a bargain basement phone.","aSentId": 620,"answer": "Great analysis!

If they had packed a Snapdragon 400 in there, as was used in the Galaxy Avant, they could have blown the friggin' doors off any previous dedicated console.
