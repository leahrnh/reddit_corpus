I mean, this doesn't look like the days of pre/post buff-roid-rage Luthor where he's just gone back to crazy greedy guy.

Plus, I mean whether people hated Man of Steel or not, it *did* give better dimension to him (Superman) than most of the other films. I know we get tired of origin stories but honestly it was one of the better ones, I think (including the liberties taken). I figure that's what Snyder is aiming for.\n\nI just hope that the movie has enough time to build up the characters, because this is a Lex Luthor I'm interested in seeing. \n\nEDIT: Clarity\n\nEDIT 2: MUH INBOX PLZ BE GENTLE\n\nEDIT 3: Hey! I just passed 2K comment karma. w00t\n\nEDIT 4: For /u/screenavenger, last edit. ", "aSentId": 673, "answer": "If Snyder doesn't get caught up in furiously masturbating over elongated and ultimately pointless CGI fight scenes it has potential to be a good movie. \n\nThere are elements of Man of Steel that are a really great movie, but it's clouded in elements that were overly-done solely to have them. It suffered from Snyder's tendency to sacrifice appropriate brevity for the spectacle of the movie, and while a spectacle is a good part of a super hero movie, a lot of Man of Steel consisted of spectacle without consequences. \n\nIt's why I've come to dislike him overall as a director. 300 was a fun film because it was a really stylized, over-the-top movie but it pushed my limit for how much pointless action they could have. The fighting goes on for ages, but it's punctuated with story and ultimately the fighting is central to the story anyway so it's not as grating as his other stuff.\n\nSucker Punch was just abysmal, and Watchmen began to show that he didn't necessarily understand the idea of restraint which is needed for a lot of movies. To make a really good Superhero movie, you need to have a certain amount of grounding to it all because otherwise the characters power make them foreign to the audience.  \n\nIn Man of Steel you can see the inklings of a Superman who is more-so Clark Kent struggling with the need to do what's right, and there's some interesting idea that could come up with unbridled idealism being too much for him to handle, but the movie doesn't really explore those. It's two separate movies: a movie where Clark Kent finds out who he is, and a movie where Superman fights General Zod. \n\nIn a better universe, Man of Steel is a story about Clark Kent overcoming his inhibitions about doing the right thing because of his self-doubt regarding his ability to accurately judge situations and whether or not his interference is right or wrong. It ends with Zod invading and acting with absolute confidence in his morality even though he's incorrect, and the first fight they have, where Zod wins, is the internalization of Superman's self-doubt and the conflict that creates.

It suffered from Snyder's tendency to sacrifice appropriate brevity for the spectacle of the movie, and while a spectacle is a good part of a super hero movie, a lot of Man of Steel consisted of spectacle without consequences. \n\nIt's why I've come to dislike him overall as a director. 300 was a fun film because it was a really stylized, over-the-top movie but it pushed my limit for how much pointless action they could have. The fighting goes on for ages, but it's punctuated with story and ultimately the fighting is central to the story anyway so it's not as grating as his other stuff.\n\nSucker Punch was just abysmal, and Watchmen began to show that he didn't necessarily understand the idea of restraint which is needed for a lot of movies. To make a really good Superhero movie, you need to have a certain amount of grounding to it all because otherwise the characters power make them foreign to the audience.  \n\nIn Man of Steel you can see the inklings of a Superman who is more-so Clark Kent struggling with the need to do what's right, and there's some interesting idea that could come up with unbridled idealism being too much for him to handle, but the movie doesn't really explore those. It's two separate movies: a movie where Clark Kent finds out who he is, and a movie where Superman fights General Zod. \n\nIn a better universe, Man of Steel is a story about Clark Kent overcoming his inhibitions about doing the right thing because of his self-doubt regarding his ability to accurately judge situations and whether or not his interference is right or wrong. It ends with Zod invading and acting with absolute confidence in his morality even though he's incorrect, and the first fight they have, where Zod wins, is the internalization of Superman's self-doubt and the conflict that creates. Then he saves Louis, talks with his dad's hologram, and realizes that despite his inability to always know everything, to not do what he thinks is right is the greater evil than misjudging a situation.

In any case, the movie definitely fell short for me.\n\nThough I agree that the movie followed the graphic novel very closely (to its credit), the changes it DID make were very frustrating, and ultimately spoiled my opinion of the film. I still recommend the book to people; I do not recommend the movie, even if they ask about it.\n\nVarious examples:\n\n1. Snyder is incapable of restraint. The book is calculated: any violence, sex, or act of grotesquery is for a reason. It does what it must to show you its characters and its world. The movie is incredibly over the top, and changes subtle actions to brazen gore-infused ones. See, for instance, Rorschach's first \"kill\" in Watchmen: in the book he cuffs a man to a pipe, gives him a saw, and sets the building on fire. Movie, he brutally opens his head with a butcher's knife. One is clever--before Saw was a thing, remember--and shows the change that Rorschach is undergoing. The other is stupid and needless.\n\n2. Though I agree that the squid-monster ending has its frustrating elements in the book, the ending chosen for the film makes the entire film a gaping plot-hole. The ending the film chooses renders the Comedian's death, Moloch's death, Manhattan's discrediting, etc, a total confusion: none of this was part of Ozy's plan in the film at all. Those things only happen in the book due to the Comedian discovering what Ozy is doing with all the artists and engineers who are working on that squid-monster.

Most damning--though entirely in line with Snyder's lack of subtlety--is the moral explication that takes place in the film. People reading the book can think about the philosophical views of both Ozy and Rorschach, characters that exist on extreme ends of the ethical spectrum. The ending is bleak in both book and film, but the book doesn't tell you who is right, who is wrong, and who is inconsequential. I found it condescending of the film to point a finger and say, \"Ozy, that's the bad guy; audience, you can stop thinking about it now.\"\n\n---\n\nThere are also many intangibles with Watchmen, as a graphic novel.

I don't always need to have the slow plodding journey and lack of storyline like Meek's Cutoff, nor do I need to have my heart wrenched like in City of God. Movies can be fun, and they can be fast paced and dumb.\n\nThe problem that I have is, well, there's a lot more potential in a superhero movie to have a really great plot. People like to go \"hey man, it's all about DAT ACTION\" but that's overlooking a large part of what's fun about comics. It's taking these really fucking stupid ideas (and alien that looks exactly human but is a superhero with super everything, including super smell) and turning them in to really interesting stories, or using them as symbols of our own ideologies and beliefs. \n\nSuperman as a character is born out of the depression and at his core is basically the idea that right actions and an earnest belief in humanitarianism and love of your fellow man can not be strong, but successful. It's not always on point because it goes across many authors and many different business models but the characters do end up developing a life of their own. Batman trying to stop crime little by little because that's the only way he knows how is a struggle we can relate to.\n\nYou can have these kind of deep messages without sacrificing action and fun. That's what comics books did, and it's why people like them. You take these very positive viewpoints and you make them something people can understand. You take Superman and Zod and you turn them in to symbols, and you have an earnest fight between the two ideologies played out with a fight. That's the internalization of their conflict, it's what gives gravity to action rather than just being two CGI characters smashing through buildings for 20 minutes.\n\nTake the ending of Guardians of the Galaxy, and spoilers if you haven't seen it but it's been out awhile. If you haven't, don't read ahead, though it won't do too much.\n\nYou have this massive, dumb, fun ship to ship battle. It is huge in scale, and you can only tell what's happening because Gunn didn't go all Lucas on us and made sure everything was easily distinguishable. The characters are still gelling with each other, and they've just transitioned from being individuals to being a team. The NOVA ships and the later interlocking shield are elements meant to show the audience that the characters have realized that they can no longer be entirely self-reliant or self-centered. But it's still an untested friendship and an untested bond. So despite their best efforts, the bad guy breaks through. \n\nYet in the end they stop him, as a direct result of the growth they had as characters throughout the story. The climax of the movie, and the conclusion of the story, is the realization of the characters that in spite of their differences they have grown together as comrades and that they are willing to risk their lives to save their friends and a planet that they have no loyalties too. Starlord comes to terms with his mother's death by coming close to it himself, and that he made a mistake by letting that death drive him away from his mom. \n\nIn the end these growths and the resulting cooperation let them defeat an enemy who drew his passions and hatred from racism, egotism, and fanaticism.

There's no level of wittiness or cleverness that can make it alright. Even if its objectively the best joke you've heard, to most Muslims such a joke in itself is immoral. Just like to you it's the most logical and rational thing to claim that it would've been offensive to joke about Anne Frank the day after her death (which I agree with btw). The same is true for any joke about Mecca, especially one that revolves around the destruction of it.\n\nHow is it that the above needs explaining? How is it not extremely obvious that *any* joke that revolves around the destruction of such a holy and important place for almost a quarter of the world could be seen as offensive? A place that's *so* important that every single Muslim *must* visit it at least once in their life (as long as they have the finances and health for it) as a staple of their religion. Again, how is it that it's so hard that such a \"joke\" is deemed offensive by a Muslim?\n\nAgain, I'm not stopping you from making such jokes or liking such jokes. I merely have an opinion on it. You can completely ignore my opinion on it and completely disagree with it. That's it. \n\nBut what makes this particular joke even more offensive is that people don't even realize how Muslims are the biggest target of ISIS. ISIS is a real threat to all Muslims right now, both directly because they're killing us, as well as indirectly because they're destroying the image of Islam and Muslims all over the world. We hate everything about ISIS and everything they stand for. One of the things they stand for is the destruction of Mecca. Yet here you guys are making a very ignorant analogy about destroying Mecca implying that it's an important place for ISIS. What? How do you not see the ignorance in all this? \n\nThe joke isn't funny, because it doesn't even make any sense. It's rooted in ignorance and misinformation. It literally does nothing but insult Muslims, all the while preaching false information regarding ISIS. This joke is objectively bad *unless* you're ignorant. The joke is also subjectively offensive. The latter should not be hard to figure out. ", "aSentId": 5251, "answer": "First, no one is talking about blowing up Mecca.  The joke was about \"taking\" Mecca.  And, btw, there can be good Anne Frank jokes as well, because everything can the target of a joke.  *Everything*.

New events may be introduced along the way, but the river of time will make sure that all the other events that should have happened, will happen in some shape or form. This event can, hypothetically, include earlier or later births of certain characters, deaths of others, and re-imagining of certain events. The river will twist and turn, but will remain a single river that will eventually correct it's flow. This assumes a single continuity, meaning the river does not split into two or more streams. If it does split into streams, this would be the creation of alternate timelines. One stream will have the original event timeline; the other contains has the alternate. Given that we see Wolverine transported back to his future that was \"fixed\" only with knowledge of his timeline, the timelines seem to only have one river in the Xmen universe. \n\nFor further context, in DoFP, the sentinels happened to OG xmen in the \"future\". When they time jump to the past, the sentinels DO happen, but it happens significantly faster, which will cascade on future events (probably why Apocalypse happens in  the 80s). I think the example we hypothetically use most often is the case of Wolverine's Adamantium. We know he has it in the future and that he obtained it from Striker and Weapon X.  in some iteration of the comics, Wolverine is made into one of the 4 horsemen of Apocalypse. It is theorized that with the river of time trying to fix itself (i.e. Future Wolverine MUST have his adamantium), Apocalypse may make Wolverine a horseman and upgrade his bone skeleton to the adamantium he is meant to have.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3s", "qSentId": 6438, "question": "and now the river of time is flowing to correct itself?\n\nWhat does that mean?", "aSentId": 6441, "answer": "\"Collapse of the waveform \"", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3s", "qSentId": 6438, "question": "and now the river of time is flowing to correct itself?\n\nWhat does that mean?", "aSentId": 6443, "answer": "It means it's a movie and not based in reality.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3s", "qSentId": 6424, "question": "Days of Future Past broke the original timeline and now the river of time is flowing to correct itself?\n\nAt least that's what they said in DoFP and what the Flash TV show have said.

The car service for just 3 days can quickly hit $5-7,000. \n\nHe will also do a morning talk show or two, local mid-day news, a few radio stations. The studio picks up the tab for everything because doing publicity is written into the contract that pretty much EVERY star signs when they take big money to make a film. It is WHY they are paid $20M, otherwise they'd get paid the SAG weekly rate of $3,000. But in the end, Will will get money for his troubles: a per diem that will be several thousand dollars a day. Yep, even though EVERYTHING is paid for, Mr. Farrell might need to hop down to Duane Reade for a soda or Tums so in that case it's good that WB gives him $3500 **per day** (depending on what's in his particular contract) for pocket change. \n\nHence, by the time he walks back into his house, the WB has shelled out over $50K in just 3 days to promote the film. That's for the out of town stuff. They'll also have a \"press junket\" where they will take over several rooms of an upscale hotel (Sony favors the Four Seasons on Doheny and basically rents the same rooms year round), provide a lavish hot breakfast &amp; lunch while stars/director/producers do print, audio and video interviews. All the attendees will get some sort of \"swag bag\" full of promotional items for the film and a EPK (Electronic Press Kit, which the studio easily paid upwards of $500K to have made, especially if it was a location shoot the EPK production team had to travel out of town for). \n\nNow that's for small and average films, the bigger ones will see the studio pay the travel and lodging expenses to bring the press to the junkets. And for their biggest films, the studios can pull out all the stops: ***Pearl Harbor*** was done on the deck of an aircraft carrier in Hawaii and ***Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol*** flew everyone to Dubai so they could see where the film's signature gag was done at the Burj Khalifa. \n\nPlus, \"marketing\" these days also is shorthand for advertising as well and a studio can spend $10M **in one day** buying television ad time on a Thursday in order for everyone including your cat to know that ***Get Hard*** is opening the next day.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3s", "qSentId": 9836, "question": "Are you the guy who commented this on both of their youtube clips?
