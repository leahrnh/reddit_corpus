If you follow who the money goes on all that really tells you is how the betting public feels about the line, not the fighter. Vegas will typically open with wide odds on one guy and you'll see it narrow until fight day barring no new information (like an injury in training, or weight cut troubles.) If you follow the gambling news on this fight I think you'll hear about a lot of early money on Manny simply because his fans have never had the opportunity to make 3 times their money on him before and that will generate betting.

This is a 50-50 fight imo.", "aSentId": 8080, "answer": "If you watch the videos where Pacman is knocking people all over the ring, his opponents are leaning forward even worse than he does -- leaving themselves open for attack. He can do whatever he wants to them. Mayweather is going to lean back with his eyes wide and his hands at the ready, because he knows Manny is coming after him. Floyd won't be leaning into this fight, he'll be leaning away from it. He won't even throw many punches until the middle of the fight because he won't be willing to expose himself until Manny gets tired. When Manny gets tired he'll clumbsily stomp toward Floyd, hoping that his unpredictable style will be enough to catch him -- but it won't. Floyd is going to keep him off balance with the jab. Manny won't hit Floyd unless Floyd makes a mistake -- which he might do because he's only human (and he's 37 at that). But if Floyd executes this fight similar to the way he has executed all of his fights, Manny doesn't really stand a chance. Floyd will get just enough points on his counter-punches to keep himself in the fight for the first half, though the momentum will seem to be in Manny's favor (until he tires). As soon as you see Floyd lower his gloves it's because Manny has fatigued just enough for Floyd to open up. And when he does, it's all over for Manny. \n\nI hope Pac does everything he possibly can to keep the onslaught going beyond round 5, because I want this upset to happen. It wouldn't be as shocking as Buster Douglas beating Iron Mike, or as exhilarating as Ali beating Forman, but it would be the third greatest upset in boxing history, in my humble opinion.
