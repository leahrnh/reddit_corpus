The 360 brings to the table a certain futurism, cool factor and class. It functions well enough, but is limited by it's barely one day battery life.  It is essentially a tiny smartphone strapped to your wrist. You have to remember to charge it every single day (if it even lasts a day depending on your usage). It is however more convenient to charge it, just plop it down on the wireless cradle when you get home. It only presents an issue if you're out a lot or use your watch a lot.\r\rThe Pebble Time is more of a companion to your smartphone, something you slap on your wrist and forget it's there - in the good way. You will likely only need to charge it once a week. What it sacrifices is everything the 360 is prized for. The Time looks similar to a toy you'd expect to find on a child's wrist. It's plastic, small and most importantly non-touch. I recommend you try out the Pebble interface before deciding, because you might not like the continuous and kinda traditional presses of buttons everywhere. This is part of the cool factor the 360 has. At the same time though, the Time has a retro vibe to it along with it's\"old-school\" technology, both by physical appearance and the software looks. To me though, the Pebble interface still makes more sense and is more usable than the attractive but sorta clunky interface of Android Wear on the 360.

So I've been looking to get a new phone. However, here's my dilemma:\r\r1) The Z3 Compact fits my needs exactly with the small screen and long battery I'm used to with my Lumia, but it's simply way too expensive. I'm paying flagship price for a S800 I'll never need - I'm more than satisfied with a S400.  At this price, I want to make sure my investment lasts at least 3 years. Is this doable/advisable? Or are there better midrange options that will fit my strict size and two day battery requirement?\r\r2) My Lumia still works. It stutters quite often and I'm starting to feel the burn of the Windows store, but it still works for all my basic functions. It has excellent 3 day battery life, but this is in part due to my light usage patterns (basically only reddit). However, I doubt it will \"survive\" the move to Windows 10, given it's performance now. It's screen is also cracked, but honestly not something that bothers me. Is it worth it to cling on to this phone till it dies (and Z3C prices drop)? It takes an extra 1-2 sec for most functions, but frequently will close apps randomly and cannot multitask (512mb RAM).
