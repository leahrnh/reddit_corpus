So I see my income as a direct result of the work that I put in.  I work with a lot of people that make a lot more money than I do.  I don't have any animosity toward them.  I observe them, to see what changes I need to make in order to make more money. \n\nThen I decide if those changes are worth it.  If it requires me to exchange large amounts of time with my family, then I am content with the amount that I currently make because I don't want to trade family time for money.   But if the change is to learn a new skill or move into a different position... Then I will do it. \n\nIt's like the guy here on reddit that said he has made 10's of millions of dollars exporting iPhones to Asia.   He has that locked, and no one else can do it.

He did something I didn't do and he was rewarded for it. \n\nFrankly, I don't understand *at all* how you are able to remove all responsibility from the individual. \n\nFor instance,  your last point about the minimum wage worker working 40 hours and barely getting by...  Describing it as \"retarded\". \n\nIt's not retarded.  It's work.  And it's an honorable thing.  Does it suck?  Yes it sucks.  That's why you don't make a career out of it.  You earn skills that people are willing to pay you for, then you move into a better position.   If you arent able to do that, then you are making poor choices.  But it is your personal responsibility to provide for yourself.  No one owes you anything. \n\nYou are acting like everyone puts in the same effort and turns in the same work and they should all receive equal pay.  I have a friend that is a brain surgeon removing tumors from the head and neck....  He makes in 4 hours what I make in a year.   But guess what.... He made better decisions and put in a lot more work than I did.  He went way into debt to go to 12 years of college.  He studied when everyone else was playing video games. \n\nPeople that follow his path don't get stuck making minimum wage.  So why should they feel animosity toward him?   He did the work, he took the risk, now *he* is being rewarded. \n\nIf you don't like where you're at in life, or you are unhappy with your income...change it.  *You* fix it.

As a German I might know a little more about that... we are talking about millions of people who often receive subsidies from the state because their income is below what social security would get them, and that really is fucking little. We are talking about an \"I hope I can keep me warm and fed for the month\"-budget, tightly bound to what is defined as the minimum subsistence.\n\nThe actual *property* of the majority of people is in decline. They cannot buy things anymore, they rely on renting them. You live for rent, you rent a car (which does not apply to almost all of the poor ones, actually, they can't afford one anyway), the rest goes for consumeables like food and energy. The dream of buying your own house and car is out of reach for the vast majority.\n\nTruth is, this is normal capitalism. This is where things have been going since the 70s. The post-war era was amazing, ironically because so much destruction had been caused in Europe, and because so much money was spent on rebuilding everything, and because of the isolation of the second world. Ironically the Cold War really helped the western working class a ton, by keeping competition out and by forcing a welfare state through the communist alternative. The weaker the cold war went, the more the markets were liberalised, the more pressure was put on the workers and the harder inequality grew. We went from an extraordinarily lucky situation into one where money market economy is inadequate. There are people who want to and can work, and there is shittons of work to be done - infrastructure crumbles, teachers and nurses are lacking, all these things - but the market does not mediate between these, because there is no profit to be made.

It's a distraction which does not offer any counter argument. But I will indulge you a bit: The two governments during those 5 years lied. Plain and simple. They applied the exact opposite of their pre-election program. The policies they applied in an atmosphere of mass media terror had no legality. They broke the constitution because they wouldn't be able to pass those \"troika\" laws else.

I can see that the president of the Commision is from Luxemburg where there is the biggest EU tax evasion parties and he seems to not do anything about it.\n\n&gt; Overlending\n\nI explained to you as simple as I could and you keep discounting the overlending as a minor thing. You have made up your mind.  Reduce exposure = Roll over bad loans. It's obvious that Germans are not affected that much from a Grexit, something we can agree on. As for those ...bailouts these 5 years, only 10% went to Greece. Europe did not give money to Greece, they rolled over  the bad loans to the European middle class sucker taxpayer. \n\n&gt; Leave or stay\n\nYou keep talking about threats, leave or stay. Where did you see those threats, can you find me a source please? The greek government actually has taken the most moderate stance that they could take. They are saying we don't believe the program has worked. Can we talk about making some changes? We will make some steps back, Europe will make some steps back and we can find a moderate solution.

They grew up resenting the West for various reasons and now they're lashing out with violence.\n\nThey first tried traveling to the Middle-East to join ISIS and fight there, but ISIS soon found out that these European recruits were shocked when they realized the atrocities committed by ISIS were real. So now ISIS sends them back to Europe right away and tells them to shoot a bunch of people over there instead.\n\nIt looks like they're spreading because there have been multiple attacks in short intervals of time but they're actually just making themselves known right now: every attack done by one of them inspires another one to do the same. There's a fixed number of them, they've all been here for a while, and once they're all taken out there won't be any left. It's not like the war in Iraq where every militant or civilian killed caused a new civilian to join them.\n\nAs for being concerned, those clowns kill much less people than car accidents, airplane crashes, cancer, swimming pools... I'm not worried about these things at all, so I see no reason to worry about being caught in a terrorist attack.

When there is no longer a need for a certain process, like the highly specific processes needed to create and assemble depleted uranium armor, the materials required to support that process are re-purposed, recycled, or scrapped. This isn't totally irreversible, but it can be prohibitively expensive to do so. That facility will also be re-purposed and to retake it after its new programs have started would be even more difficult.\n\nAcquisitions are another big deal. You've secured a supply line of some sort of part or material that comes from a unique source. You stop ordering that for a few years and wish to order it again, sorry, your source is too occupied with the new customer it had to find to replace you. Now you're stuck having to design new parts or compromise on materials.\n\nThe knowledge is even more touchy. There needs to be a continuum of knowledge to put together a product as complicated as a tank. For every written instruction used to describe the design/construction process, there's unwritten problem solving going on to make that instruction easier/more effective to carry out. A lot of these things require specialized knowledge that only a few people have (who would know only by working on that project), that you would have to replace after closing down tank production. Don't think it's so easy to get that guy back. He'll find another gig and will be reluctant to return to the company that just laid him off.\n\nYes, your team could find all the manuals that would be archived and, through trial and error, learn all those unwritten skills again... but it would take years before the first new Abrams rolled off the line and years more before it matches the quality and reliability of the product before the line got shut down.\n\nI'm not arguing for the continued production of Abrams. The situation is absolutely ridiculous. We're producing way too many.

If you make such an extraordinary claim then you should provide sources.\n\n&gt; Europe as a whole bitching that the US wasn't doing enough for the intervention in Libya.\n\nParts of Europe didn't even support or participate in the intervention.\n\n&gt; Not only that but then there's the level of support the US provides to Europe when it comes to logistics in places like Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nAgain: Iraq and Afghanistan were US wars. The European countries that participated only did so as a favour to the US. Countries like Poland didn't have or anticipated ever having to transport troops that far. In fact most smaller NATO countries are forced to specialize in certain areas with the idea that larger NATO countries cover other areas for them. If you don't like that then criticize NATO procedure but not the countries for following it. That's just ridiculous.\n\n&gt; If you really feel that way, how was WWI or WWII in any interest for the US? All those wholly European caused wars did was screw up the world for many decades to come, and create many of the problems since. And being dragged into both certainly wasn't in the interests in the US.\n\nYou don't think the war in Iraq was disastrous and pointless? That's just both laughable and sad. I don't know why I should give you a lesson in history. But in WWI a large part of Europe would have welcomed the US to stay out of it. In WWII the axis declared war on the US. And the US came out ahead in both wars. So what's your point?\n\n&gt; Compared to GDP, no they don't. The average is somewhere around less than 2%, and this is definitely flies in the face of what they used to spend historically.\n\nYou mean it is within NATO requirements?
