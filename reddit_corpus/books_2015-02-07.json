It's a self-correcting problem: if employment was terrible, they'd lose everyone, so instead they're appreciative of their workers and give them interesting work to do, and try to find other ways to make it worthwhile to spend time at a nonprofit. It practically stands to reason that they have to be like this, or else they'd be falling apart, but they have a regular staff you can meet at their events who in no way seem like outrageous jerks (again, why would a jerk seek employment at a scholarly library anyway, when there are plenty of highly-paid for-profit jobs for jerks in SF).\n\nThe people who I know worked hard but took great satisfaction in knowing the work they were doing was unique and not available at other places; furthermore, instead of it going to some forgettable app or something no one will care about in 10 years, it was part of a larger project that will arguably have a legacy and an impact (actually, more of an impact, as an archive) in years to come.
