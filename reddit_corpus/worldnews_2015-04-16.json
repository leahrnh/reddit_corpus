I think that many of these people would pursue other fields where they could be fairly compensated for the amount of work they had to do to get there and the level of expertise they have. Again, I truly value educators. They are the foundation from which all of these fields are based on, but the amount of training required for a career in education is substantially less than that for a career in medicine.

I absolutely refuse to ever work at a hagwon (an after school \"school\") to support the shitty system. These poor kids go to school, go home to eat, go to school again to study more, then go to a hagwon and come home late at night.

IF they get caught, they can be thrown in prison (the Cinderella Law).

There's been several incidents were my coteachers were scared that the mom would call and complain to the school. I've heard stories if the kid is failing, the mom will call the school or hagwon bitching \"Why are you a bad teacher? Why are you failing my kid? Why are you ruining my child's future?\" It's never 'how can I help my child do better?', it's always 'this is your fault'. All of a sudden, the kid gets a better grade.\n\nIt's so sad, I can look back on my childhood and remember all the fun things I did as a child, but when I ask my students after a vacation what they did; I get \"I just studied.\" answers.

That is true. But what you do is this:\n\nIn 2010, test all students across the state, and analyze avg test scores across the state, district, school, student economic background, city population, and teacher.\n\nIf you see that Ms. Jones consistently yields students, year after year, with lower-than-average test scores in Algebra I when compared to her school, district, and state, you can see that she isn't a good teacher. This is in contrast with Ms. Perfect's algebra II classes, who seems to consistently provide higher-than-average test scores when compared to her school, district, and state. Expect for maybe year 2012, that was a crappy year for her class Algebra II class. In fact, if you look at the test scores for Ms. Jones Algebra I class in 2011, you can see that she had lower-than usual test averages when compared to her previous years of teaching. This shows its not necessarily the teacher's fault.\n\nMaybe you argue that teachers may appear below average if they teach in a troubled area. Well, they won't, because it would be better to compare her test scores to other teachers who also teach in troubled areas. Maybe a teacher teaches in a rural town, with 8 students in her class. So you also compare her scores to other students from rural towns with low class-sizes.\n\nOf course, you'll need to analyze after a few years. After then, you'll be able to re-train or re-hire teachers.\n\nAnd that's why there are many states with standardized testing. Your school will look terrible if you don't fix the test scores/teachers. The real problem is when standardized tests interfere with the teacher's style of teaching. \n\nPerhaps the teacher knows her students won't be able to learn all of algebra the state will test over, but can teach them the basics and enough to get through with life. However, with standardized testing, you'll have to \"teach the test,\" and may end up with students barely passing, but not being able to understand the concepts of what they are doing- they end up memorizing a pattern, as opposed to learning how to discover patterns. \n\n**TL;DR** Standardized testing will get you all the data you need to evaluate a teacher.

By the same token, most education programs only require you to know as much about the subject matter as a child will be able to understand. It doesn't require hours upon hours of puzzling through unintuitive concepts, or entire nights spent in a lab redoing calculations or fixing code because it just won\u2019t produce the correct result and you don\u2019t know why. This is common, intermediate problem in Computer Science for students to solve: \n\n* Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?\n\nor for a more practical question: \n\n* Given x students, y classrooms and z timeslots, how do you teach a computer to quickly generate an optimal class schedule for a university? No room can be in use at the same time and students of any given major will be able to have multiple timeslot options for the classes they are expected to take in their year. Also cluster the rooms such that no one has to dash across campus, but there might not be enough classrooms in any given vicinity to make that always feasible. \n\nHow do you even begin to tackle those?

There\u2019s a reason why people so quickly drop out of STEM. And while it\u2019s not good or right, it\u2019s understandable when they get self-righteous after having spent so long banging their head against a wall feeling useless for not being able to understand a difficult problem, and then suddenly they solve it and go on to create some of the most complex and advanced technology that our species has ever accomplished.

In a college course where you learn the difficult material I mentioned, it's very rare to have a good teacher. STEM professors are notorious for poor communication skills and being more interested in their research than education. You spend most of the time teaching yourself, or one of your classmates figures it out first and teaches it to you the best they can and you do the same for them. Which is where much of the condescending attitudes come from (\"I figured out this insanely complicated problem AND I did it myself\"). It would be better if we did have good teachers, across the board, but definitely at the college level. \n\n&gt; You admit that what they have is, at least somewhat, beyond you, and then go on to deride them as not important. \n\nI never said it's not important; as a matter of fact, I think it's immensely important. My point was twofold: a) that it is not as intellectually challenging as other fields like STEM and b) that because it's less intellectually challenging, the teaching market is flooded with not-intellectually-inclined people. I want a society in which teachers are given the pay and respect they deserve, but only the deserving manage to become teachers. Redesigning the education degree programs such that they only pass people who are masters of both the subject matter (which likely requires a degree in the subject matter itself) and of communicating it to students (currently the focus of these programs) will make it by nature more challenging. That would weed out the riff raff who want to work with children but not necessarily with academics, when academics is central to the job.  \n\nMy point was also that people who are not in STEM know peripherally that it's hard material but don't fully grasp what it really is or why it turns people into snobby assholes sometimes.

Never mind that stuff.\n\nIf you had a teachers day it would be like this: \n\nYou show up to work and you are charged with progressing 150+ employees through a particular skill. Think upper management. You inherited these people from completely different backgrounds. All of them have had different basic training in the skill. You don't know exactly who in their past taught them what, but you don't have the time to go back and teach from the ground floor. You just have to make it work.\n\n70 of them don't want to be there, but it's not that they do enough to get by. They do almost NOTHING. They **actively** work to circumvent you at every turn. 50 of them do exactly as much as they can to get by, and 30 do everything you ask, but no one cares about what you've taught those people to do. Literally no one. All your boss cares about is the 70 that, again, have no interest in your help. They have to be there. The best part? They can't be fired! Hahahaha. No one is ever fired. Ever. You literally have to deal with these people, and your entire career (since legislature was passed by people that have never done your job) is based off your ability to \"inspire\" 70/150 employees that do not respect you, care about you, or listen to a god damn thing you ever say. This isn't dead poet's society. Teachers get fucking fired for less than what Robin Williams did. Oh and...\n\nThe 70 stumble around with tasks you've tried to train them on from day one and continued to train and remind them about day after day after day. You know why they can't get it, though. You see them dozing during your training sessions and throwing shit at each other and talking over you. You give them projects to work on in their own time and they ignore that these projects exist. You can't transfer these kids. You can't become not responsible for them. The best you can do is temporarily send them away, **but that decision negatively impacts you because their achievement is still tied to you no fucking matter what**. Time away from you makes them more shitty than the absolutely abysmal these employees already are. Just lay the hammer down? Okay, but now those people that don't give a shit about you HATE you, and you face them every single day.\n\nYou toil away trying every trick you can think of. You bribe them and that kind of works on some but it ultimately can't sustain them. You get no real reprieve during your 9. You are always working on what you'll try next, and every time you try to get a feel for their abilities you have 150 evaluations to look at. You have to do this often, maybe 40 times between little assessments and big assessments for half the year. Otherwise you don't know when to move on and when to hang onto a particular aspect. Again, you have to get this done. You can't just say fuck it or else you *will* get fired (performance based assessments. Yay!) 40*150......6,000 assessments...oh yeah..that's for half the year so 12,000 assessments that you must look over during the year. You get an hour during your day to do that+prepare to try some new trick+duties around the building. Usually the last one dominates the whole hour, so you have to look at these 12,000 assessments on your own time. \n\nYou know when you go home at 5 and your wife has dinner ready? You eat it, hang with the kids, check out a movie, go to the park, have sex with your wife, etc? Nah. Fuck all that. Eat quickly and stare at paper. That's your evening. If you're lucky you'll get through it all and keep your head above water. If something comes up at home ? Nothing unexpected *ever* happens to anyone so it's **so** rare but IF something happens that you have to take care of? You're behind! You either put more time into staring at paper or you just stay behind.\n\n7:30-3:00 + the *at minimum* 3 hours a night you spend grading. That's your day. \"That sounds like shit...why would anyone do that? It's the 3 months \"off\" right ?\" No. \n\nFor all this you get around 30k on average. You either take it in a nine month installment or less each month over twelve. Either 3666 a month (but 3 months no pay) or 2750 a month full year. \n\nSo why do it? It's because this job isn't just important for your employer's bottom line. It's important for *society*. What do you do? Would society literally fall to shit without you? Probably not. All the while you do this job people act like you have it easy. People say \"work for only 9 months a year? Teachers have it easy.\" \n\nNigga you probably do fuckin shit all nothing and get paid more. You probably send 4 e-mails important e-mails, type about a paragraph worth of text into a spreadsheet or word, and everyone at least does the bare minimum. If they don't at least do the bare minimum they get fucking canned (90% of the time). You have it easy and teachers have hell. Constant hell.\n\nMy background: I'm a profressional musician with a Music Ed degree. I sub on the side when things are slow. I see exactly the above play out every day. I'm lucky. I get to walk in and walk out each day. I have minimum responsibility. Every job I've ever had is better than teaching. No contest. \n\nDuring my student teaching I was at an inner city school in a medium-&gt;large sized capital city. We had parent teacher conferences and out of the 600 kids in the program I talked to 4 kids' parents. Think long and hard on that. Teachers get students that don't have any structure in their life. Parents that don't care. Administrations that are forced to change how they assess each year. Students that are too busy figuring out how they eat their next meal. Students wrapped up in drugs and domestic violence and shit that they shouldn't even know exists. \n\nBut yeah man those 3 months \"off\" (not even fucking true) are hella worth.

What this means is that a lot of people end up in processing facilities for too long and become vulnerable to institutionalisation-related mental illnesses. [Brief op-ed]: There have been recent worries buoyed by the media about radical muslim ideologies taking root because of compassion towards asylum seekers/refugees. This is largely false and extremely divisive. A recent example are the Lindt cafe killings which were perpetrated possibly by the Fake-Sheik but also possibly by the police when they stormed the cafe to rescue the hostages. Ballistics have yet to be released, so far as I'm aware. What's interesting is that the location of this incident was reported by the police in the media months before as being a prime target for any terrorist attack. Additionally, the perpetrator was found to be unconnected to IS or any radical muslim faction and was instead pursuing a personal agenda against the state for adjudications made in relation to the death of his wife. So the conjecture is that the media generated the conditions under which this individual could exploit anti-Muslim sentiment.

Stopping the rescue operations will only mean more people will die at sea and do nothing in relation to the number of people who try, which are affected by other factors. Second of all, the vast majority only want to get to Europe so they can take minimum wage jobs cleaning, take several of those jobs working up to 18 hours a day, so they can send money back home where it is desperately needed. In fact, the whole village often saved the money to send them off, so many of these men feel they cannot return, they have to get to Europe or die trying.

They said the youth needed to hear a voice that was both experienced in what they were talking about and Muslim, so that they would trust them.\n\nYou would not believe the hateful, awful comments that story got. It sort of shows that no matter how much effort Muslims put into stopping terrorism, unless they actually just de-convert and join a gay pride parade, people won't accept that they're not secretly \"bad guys\".\n\nEdited to add the story also included stories of white ex-radicals, who were in racist hate groups.

For those who fight against God and His messenger, God's retribution is severe.\n\nthis is God speaking to the angels during the battle of badr, where an army of 1000 pagans sought out an aggressive campaign against 300 Muslims. it is not Allah calling for Muslims to strike, it is noting that God ordered the angels to support the Muslims in the battle.\n\nin that same surah: 8:61\n\n&gt;But if the enemy incline towards peace, do thou (also) incline towards peace, and trust in God: for He is One that hears and knows (all things).\n\nunless attacked, Muslims are not to strike. 8:61 is a primary law of jihad, which is defensive in nature.\n\nQur'an 9:14\n\nyou forgot the preceding verses\n\n&gt;Will you not fight such people who have been breaking their solemn pledges, who conspired to banish the Messenger and were the first to transgress against you? Are you afraid of them? If you are true Believers, surely Allah has a greater right that you should fear Him. Fight them. Allah will chastise them by your hands and will bring disgrace and degradation upon them and succor you against them and soothe the hearts of many believers.\n\nemphasis on: \"breaking their solemn pledges\", \"were the first to transgress against you\"\n\nthese verses are referencing defensive warfare.\n\nQur'an 9:123\n\n&gt;O Believers, fight with these disbelievers who are near you,121 and they should find you firm and stern; and know that Allah is with the God fearing.\n\nthis verse and the preceding ones are referring to those pagans who would call themselves Muslims only to gain entry in order to sow discord and chaos amidst the Muslim ranks. strategically, it makes perfect sense to weed out those spies who would seek to cause problems.\n\nQur'an 47:3-4\n\n&gt;Therefore, when you meet the disbelievers in the battle-field, first smite their necks.

(pretty radical opinion, sorry if I crossed some boundaries) I believe that religion was created by man to follow morality guidelines. Some people take it too literal and create trouble. Some apply it into their everyday lives and allow it to grow and develop their character. These men fall under uneducated people who are blinded by faith, and have manipulated the teachings of a peaceful religion to justify the end of human lives if these lives have a hint of western ideology. Being an ex-muslim, my words might have a bit of bias to them, but the koran preaches nothing that is happening today. Islam puts faith in every prophet/major figure in every religion. We just believe that god is an almighty being who sent significant human beings down and assigned them the role of prophet. It teaches lessons from christianity, judaism, and the last portion of god's message sent down with Muhammed. The extremists in today's world are the equivalent of early American Ku Klux Klan members who used christianity to justify the killing of non-whites/jim crow laws/etc. Inevitably, I feel that just broadening the horizons of someone's mental capacities is the answer to a lot of conflict in the world. We're not all the same though, and people from all walks of life will continue to do atrocities like this for as long as humans live. The question shouldn't be why these men are doing evil (there will always be evil), but which propaganda will influence society to unite and act on these atrocities? The propaganda is ultimately fueled by which conflict yields the most money. We get more resources from invading the middle east than we would if we had invaded Mexico, and i'm pretty sure it's just as bad down there. What have we done for them? Sure, we have highly enforced border control, but that's just in place to stop their problems from coming to our homes.\n\nOn a side note: The views of women in islam is very weird. I cant really give you an answer to this, because i've only experienced it in western society, and women are treated equally to men here. I feel the issue is that the middle east does not take education seriously, and has not progressed at the same rate that the west has. You can find this anywhere though.

And once Americans can look at each other as American and that we are together and not like \"o he is white /black or \"your a man/women. than we can have a real since of unity, all men are created equally (and women too, you understand man-huMANity it doesn't mean just men) instead of people jumping around the race/gender card trying not to offend it or have a\" I poor me \"moment. Once we we look at each other as American and have that since if togetherness we will be able to find the right AMERICAN to lead our country, we will be able to see the good and the bad in them. And not\" I'm a women(or other point you have no need to run for office on) pick me\". Only then will real change happen, a real leader will emerge, we will make real progress. This is a reality, I can't wait till more people realize this, we can get there over night. And don't think I'm some sort of racist /gender inequality (I can't remember the term off the top of my head right now) I mean. If you had really read what I'm saying. I am saying I want equality for every one and once we get there things will change? And not the flowery kind of equality every one and there dog plaints but, one that bring us together as one nation.  And man there was a lot of jumping around there pretty much Islamic country's/unofficial (terrorist groups) don't need nor be trusted with nuclear abilities, and when Americans actually look at each other and see where all the same and have a since if unity in our country we will have a leader who will finally be the right person to bring out country back to its former glory. we will be able to fix this problem, save other country's from destruction and set the example. Any ways I'm sorry for the big huge comment here. Seeing this just got me all fired up and I need to stop my self before it go any longer. But I mean what I said is important and I hope will be remembered. Any ways have a good day guys and I'll just leave this here maybe some one will see it and step up for what we need in this country.

I mean \"sure\" you were)\n\nHe does need to be tried.... before they strip his title and seize his assets. \n\nEven though they don't care about these little problems of law in there endless witch hunt of \"terrorists\" like journalists or international law. \n\nSo Suddenly the UK is a fucking paragon of upholding the law when one lord may be out through uncomfortable trial but thousands of poor people's lives? But you are right. \n\nYet I am sure there are provisions in the law for some form of judgement to be made. \n\nLet's swap this around. Recently an American politician was accused of raping his wife who had Alzheimer's.\n\nSo how would that go to trail? What's to stop people raping people with Alzheimer's if you know they cannot go to trail? \n\nSo what would they do in the case of a mentally ill person strapping a bomb to themselves (maybe put by someone else) and decided to walk up and embrace the prime minister or a group of politicians.\n\nI am pretty sure we can stop pretending law is fair in this day and age. If it was it would set in stone. Not for when it suits your purpose and can be moved when it doesn't. Which is happening far too much. \n\nSo yes I do agree a trail is needed, but there are varying forms of trial and varying forms of evidence needed. Perhaps a criminal one is beyond but an investigation by peers using information from the police in a closed from the public procedure seems fair. At least to review his peerage. \n\nThese through years we have seen the law abused for politicians own means. This is not making it seem any better. There should be at the least a meeting of his peers who can take into account the evidence and make Much in the same manner they do with matters of security. Let's see the lords themselves have their \"private\" trail like they do so much when they decide if a person should be force fed or fit for torture. The trails were they decide rendition is ok. \n\nLet the family get the full support of evidence from the police in a civil case against his estate and assets. If he passes all those and is find not guilty then yes, that at least is fair. \n\nTldr So I do agree he does needs a trail but I don't agree there is only one type of trail he can face and that there is nothing further to be done. Investigations by peers and special consideration of the evidence can at least be seen out of public to review peerage. He also should be open to a civil case. One or both should be sufficient to prove some kind of guilt (or not) and either way something can be done, rather then going \"my bad\"\n\n\n\n", "aSentId": 55420, "answer": "The trouble is that he can't have a trial because he can't assist in his own defence due to dementia.

The actions of the CPS/Police can only be described, at best, as an utter disgrace. At worst (and I fear far more probably) it is a pathetic attempt to shield a prominent member of the British elite from the normal judicial system. I find it only too easy become emotionally overwhelmed by the injustice of this case, and the way in general that the nobility always seems to be able to tiptoe through these minefields with such ease.\n\nHowever, as much as I may loth Janner, and am deeply suspicious of what may be flagrant attempt to protect him, I think I must accept that it is at least possible that he is too demented to stand trial. Indeed, the type of crimes of which he is accused are, I am given to understand, often an indication that the perpetrator may also have been the victim of this kind of devastating treatment in his youth. If this is the case, then it may even be that Janner could deserve our sympathy rather than our approbation.\n\nI am not interested in retribution and have no personal grievance against Janner, but the thing that so sickens me in this case is that the victims have been so badly treated by the state. After waiting 24 years since Janner's name was first mentioned in court, they have essentially been told to shut up once again.\n\nThe judgment of Alison Saunders reminds me of a trial of a headmaster who was accused of raping several schoolgirls aged around fourteen to sixteen years old. This was around 20 years ago. The Police had carefully gathered statements from the girls, and gently supported them in the hopes of being able to remove a harmful person from his position of power and trust. The brief news item I recall hearing (probably on the Radio 4 program \u201cWomen\u2019s Hour,\u201d and certainly not a prominent news program) told that after a buildup of many months, the trial had been dismissed by the judge in a private meeting the night before the case was due to be heard. (I cannot imagine what being raped might be like, but I can imagine how traumatizing it would have been to have had to live through the corrosive fear of being cross-examined in court in the many months of the pre-trial buildup.) The next day, the defendants arrived in court only to be deigned an opportunity to say a single word. They must have been devastated at the betrayal of their positions. The simple comment on the radio program was the sad acknowledgement the state was only furthering exactly the same kind of abuse that had been visited on them before by the headmaster. \n\nThe heart of this appalling mess is not actually that Janner not is being taken to trial, it is that the CPS so fundamentally misunderstands what the nature of  justice is (though, perhaps the word \u201cjustice\u201d is the wrong here, and I should say the nature of \u201cdoing the right thing\u201d). If the Director of Public Prosecutions has any integrity she should either: a) create some kind of public forum that will allow the complainants to be heard, or: b) resign her position on the basis that she is not being permitted to offer the complainants an opportunity that could even remotely do justice to the wrongfulness of their experience.\n\nOf course when I look at the CPS website I can find no way to email the DPP. In the light is this I can only urge you to pass your feeling on this matter to your MP, the PM, and Secretary of State. \n", "aSentId": 55609, "answer": "The allegations against Janner go back decades.

Affirmative action isn't a blanket law that requires every company to hire X-amount of minorities. Rather, it is a law that allows some recourse to applicants if they notice a company is repeatedly discriminating against folks of a minority race or if a hiring manager is dumb enough to say \"we aren't hiring you because of your race\". If they never commit racial discrimination, they will never be affected by the law.\n\nNow, some institutions may try to ensure they have a certain number of minority hires because they perceive it makes them look more inclusive.

By doing this you allow multiple oil companies to lift their propriety fuels from the same facility.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13", "qSentId": 57531, "question": "Should probably expand that list, because a LOT of tier one fuel companies resell BPs fuel.  Mobil/Exxon and many more.  A lot of no-name gas stations use it as well.  When I was leaving mobil, I was told that it was now BP fuel and Mobil was just owning the gas stations and running the quiki marts inside.  That wasn't long after the oil spill.  I believe it was within a few months following the spill, if not less.  The no-name stations just get cheaper fuel from BP that comes with less detergents.  It may not be refined as well either.  They also share a lot of wells with other companies.\n\nAfter their last oil spill, I actually started going to BP more often.  I figured they were going to get fined to the moon by the govt., they were spending a fuckload of money on cleaning and blocking the well, etc.  I figured the money to clean shit up had to come from *somewhere*, so I gave them more of my money.  It was either that or buy it from companies that they vend to.  Then the company that resells BP fuel gets a cut of what we buy and BP gets less than if you merely went to their own gas stations.  Either way, you're often going to end up with BP fuel in your tank.  \n\nI don't see how BP ending projects for green shit is a reason to stop going there.  Do you understand how many companies have been doing this??  Clearly not.  \n\nLook at bosch and siemens.  If you have a car, I guarentee you that you have several parts from bosch at minimum in your car.  33% chance your battery is from Bosch.  Their are three manufacturers of car batteries on the planet.  One of them is Bosch.  Another is exide and I cannot remember the third.  Other than those three, every other brand is a left over.  \n\nCar batteries get rebranded every time they've sat on the shelf for too long.  They go to car manufacturers first and expensive batteries in the 125-150+ USD range are usually first hand as well.  If they don't sell, they go back to one of the three companies from X store and are resold to another under a shitty brand, like DieHard, duralast, everstart, etc.  They end up at places like WalMart, Napa, PepBoys, autozone, advanced auto, etc.  \n\nIf you ever need a battery, I worked for AAA and they got batteries direct from exide.  They cost about the same AND they install it for you, along with testing your electrical system.  You also get a 3 year warranty with five year prorated.  \n\nAnd round and round we go.  Everything that is relatively universal to cars is passed around the industry.  I'm really into older BMWs.  I used to buy BMW coolant, until I had to run to the corner store and grab some Prestone.  The concentrate, not 50/50 mix.  I put it down on the floor next to a recent, empty bottle of BMW branded coolant.  As I walked away, I noticed something looked very similar...the entire fucking bottle.  Cap and all.  The difference: Prestone is a yellow bottle with neon green fluid.  BMW bottle is silver with blue fluid.  There may be a few differences in detergents, but I highly doubt it.  You can mix modern Prestone with any coolant and the same goes for BMW coolant.  So, prestone sells the same coolant to many car manufacturers.\n\nThis is why choosing things by brand in relation to cars, other than the actual car manufacturer is not very smart.  Electronics, fluids (like oil and gas), tires...nearly everything that is generic to cars, comes from few places.  Companies end up running borderline monopolies on those sorts of common goods.  It takes a lot of capital to get into those businesses and as time has gone on, it's just not viable to expect to compete with companies like Bosch, etc.  Companies go out of business or leave a certain market, because they can't compete with the largest of manufacturers...as that is happening, no one can jump in and compete with a company like bosch, exide, BP, Prestone, etc.  If I tried to start an airline tomorrow, companies like Lufthansa and such would eat me up, right?  \n\nSo, you get monopolies.  Like BP.  Either way, good chance your going to end up with their fuel.  So many people have avoided BPs after that oil spill.  They ended up closing a lot of their own proprietary stations and began selling more fuel to other top tier companies.  It saved BP oil sales and other oil companies didn't have to pump as much, they could rent out their own rigs or rights to rigs, etc.\n\nEye opener.", "aSentId": 57550, "answer": "I haven't bought BP gas (from a BP-branded station) since the oil spill.

This idea that somehow the EU and US are trying to rip Ukraine away from Russia is foolish.  \n\nWhat you call a color revolution, everyone else calls \"being pissed at your government and not having the faith hat your vote will make a difference\".  Yes, the US and EU supported the Maiden.  Do you know why?  Because when it becomes obvious that a government is going to fall, you make nice with the people in line to replace it.  The US and EU saw an opening, and they took it.  Putin saw a threat, invaded Crimea, lied about it, then admitted to it, then invaded Donbass, lied about it, then Shoigu admitted to it just this week.  It was the US that told Kiev to keep Russian as an official language, mind you, so to assert that this is some conspiracy to hurt Russia is baseless.

What of the Tatars?  What of their rights?

For all of your talk of Nazis, fascists, and lack of minority rights...look what's happening in Russia!

It's impossible for an outsider to take anything the Kremlin says seriously about Ukraine when Russia is the most fascist state on that entire continent.  \n\nUkraine needs to accept its Russian heritage, but it's impossible for Ukrainians to do that when Russia is waging war in their country.

In laymans terms, we prefer an equal amount of consumption across each period of our lifetime versus all consumption today and none at all later. \n\nTherefore, if we expect our economy to grow in the future, we will borrow to smooth this consumption. If we expect to underperform tomorrow, we will lend. Even more interesting is if we can use the borrowed money to induce the expected growth! We saw this go bad in Mexico in the 20th Century. The market expected exceptional growth, however it didnt materialise. Eastern europe post-USSR seen as a success story of this narrative. \n\nInternational macro is a really interesting subject, that is undergoing a large period of change at the moment. Things that were negligible in the past can now cause large contagion in economies. Markets now are much more exposed to currency effects and valuation effects, sometimes with disastrous conclusions.

The more they hold, the more vested they are in the well-being of the U.S economy. That's what it boils down too. \n\nTreasury bills are more of an investment than they are debt. The U.S *allows* other countries to buy treasury bills. They're like a bank. They're not trying to force these countries to buy them, and they certainly aren't actively soliciting (begging). The more t-bills other countries buy, the more they're putting *themselves* at risk because they're buying more and more into the U.S. They're saying \"we have confidence in the U.S economy and we're proving it with our $1.2 trillion dollars investment in t-bills.\" The U.S isn't dumb and this isn't a Hollywood movie. If a single country dumping its t-bills was enough to harm the U.S economy, the U.S simply wouldn't sell t-bills to foreign countries. \n\n&gt; Evidence suggesting the existence of aliens has never been observed.\n\nThat's kind of my point.
