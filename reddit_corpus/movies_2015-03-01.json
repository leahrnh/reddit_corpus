Probably not. If my (and all my friend's) childhood in the 90s is any measure, they've most likely seen quite a few films that are much 'worse' than Alien. We could - and would - get our hands on just about every VHS we wanted to even then. It's only gotten easier these days I imagine.\n\nYes, age restrictions are obviously a good idea and very necessary, but they just don't work after a certain point, and a kid leaving elementary school is pretty much that point - at least in my experience. I think it's actually a good idea to watch some 'scary' movies with kids around that age, then you're able to put some things into context. They're going to watch these movies anyway, and probably sooner rather than later. And I think they're going to be less affected by unsuitable stuff if they've had at least some prior, 'guided' experience with movies. \n\nI rembemer watching The Evil Dead and Exorcism when I was that age - alone. They both shook me up quite a bit. But I'd watched Silence of the Lambs on TV a year or two before with my dad and while it was pretty exciting, everything was fine. If I was scared, I was scared in a good way because I felt totally safe - and I knew that \"it's just a movie, son\".\n\nI don't advocate watching Planet Terror with your 9-year-old nephew, but yeah, I think watching Aliens with a bunch of 5th graders is pretty much fine. You're there, you can explain stuff and you can stop the movie and turn the lights on in the unlikely event of someone honestly freaking out. You can even find some pretext to make the frightened child not look like a chicken in front of his/her peers.

He's R\u00e9my Julienne.\nHe is directing the scene.\nDominique, his son, is driving the Ferrari.\n\nThe thing is, during one of the shot of the 360\u00b0 in the gravel, he was a little bit too fast, and when you do that kind of figure on gravel... it's tricky.\nNormally, the Ferrari was to come back to the road after its... style figure. I can't remember how many shots were taken (not much really), Dominique was always able to come back on the road and keep on the good fun but that particular time... the Ferrari went on \"her\" way, beside the road.\n\nNo harm done, except for the car of course...\n\nI really had fun these few days, had multiple tour on the Aston Martin, and the Ferrari of course (but the Aston Martin... dream car).\n\nIn Goldeneye, the tank Bond is driving is in fact driven by R\u00e9my Julienne himself !\nHe learned in the French Army when he was young and full of mischieves.

If you look at Aliens 1-3 they all take place basically one after the other. Ripley wakes up. ALIEN. \n\nTo be honest, that's what I love about it. While I'm not a huge fan of Alien 3, arguably one of the most memorable lines from the series comes from that movie and mentions exactly what you're talking about : Ripley says to the xenomorph \"you've been in my life so long I can't remember anything else\".\n\nThat's Ripley's tragedy. In essence, Ripley's odyssey from Alien 1 to 3 is beautiful. 3 could have been done better, but ultimately I'll take it.\n\nAs much as I love Sigourney Weaver, Michael Biehn, and as much as I was bummed about Alien 3's opening which killed off Hicks and Newt, I appreciate Ripley's story arc. It makes sense. Killing Hicks and Newt off, ultimately, doesn't destroy Aliens btw. Ripley still grew as a person in Aliens. She still saved Newt. She still fought with Hicks. She matured with them. That they died in their sleep doesn't delete Ripley's accomplishments in Aliens.\n\nI'm not sure I'm happy about disregarding the Alien sequels. It could be good nonetheless. But ultimately, I would have preferred that Blomkamp starts another storyline with other characters. Everything about Ripley still happened, but there's still space in the galaxy for other characters to encounter the xenomorphs at one point. Hell, the video game Alien Isolation had quite a good idea using Ripley's daughter as the main character searching for her mother. In Aliens, they say Ripley's daughter died of old age, but that could easily have been a lie by Weyland Yutani to keep Ripley where they wanted her to be.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3s", "qSentId": 4217, "question": "Wonder if they will also bring Rebecca Jordan (Newt) and Lance Henriksen (Bishop) back", "aSentId": 4218, "answer": "Rebecca Jordan is a school teacher now and looks a lot different than she did...so no she is not coming back.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3s", "qSentId": 4219, "question": "Rebecca Jordan is a school teacher now and looks a lot different than she did...so no she is not coming back.", "aSentId": 4220, "answer": "So, she's not a six year old little girl anymore?
