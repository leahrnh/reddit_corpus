The main limiting factor for the besieged is usually water, if policies haven't changed since I tactically GTFO of that blighted industry the SOP is to cut off water and electricity to the overrun buildings. \n\nCafeteria meals have been deliberately tweaked to primarily consist of things that don't keep long without refrigeration, so not much beyond corn bread and canteen goods are going to be edible after a few days. \n\nIf these were dormitories, the water situation is going to fuck them over significantly faster than food. Maybe a dozen toilets and sinks without drain plugs per every dormitory unit of one hundred people. Cellblocks are more sustainable, with one toliet holding about 1.5 gallons of water per two man cell. No clue about the tents. After about three days, the dehydration is going to be degrading the cognitive abilities and physical performance of the protestors involved. \n\nIt was hot and sunny today and will be tomorrow, so they'll probably be quite thirsty by Monday. If the organizers were really looking ahead, the weather forecast predicts rain on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday so collecting rainwater may allow the besieged to extend the time they can hold out. \n\nThese inmates aren't getting their meds as well. Wouldn't be surprised if we see a few deaths from diabetes, heart attacks, etc. Many old men in the system, and a lot of HIV/AIDs cases with compromised immune systems. \n\nThe lack of electricity also isolates the inmates; they can't use radios or watch TV to keep abreast of the public reaction to their uprising and see what kind of forces are being marshaled against them. The batteries of the smuggled cell phones they are using to coordinate efforts between units and contacts on the outside will steadily drain. Limits their weaponry as well; a Dixie cup full of syrup, sugar, and water boiled for twenty minutes in a microwave is a nightmarish thing to have thrown in someone's face and poured down armor. Same for using extension cords to electrify puddles of urine and the like. \n\nThe fact that they have no hostages is very surprising. You're looking at one unarmed officer at a desk, probably a middle aged woman, to one hundred inmates. Or two in each cellblock of a few dozen with 1-2 patrolling between units outside. It would be an absolute trivial manner to dogpile them and take them hostage, which makes me very curious about how things played out. The lack of hostages makes the strategy of just waiting out the rioter's supplies more viable. \n\nAny firearms the inmates have somehow gotten ahold of are going to have no reloads. Only armed guards are typically in towers or fields outside the wire, carrying a mix of Mini-14s, revolvers, lever action 30-30s, and pump action shotguns. From the sound of it the riot never made it anywhere they could obtain firearms and armor. Majority of weapons (if any) will be padlocks from personal lockers stuffed in socks, blades from broken disposable razors melted into toothbrushes, improvised brass knuckles, clubs, etc. \n\nThey'll try to create barricades everywhere and rearrange the interiors to slow down a storming of the buildings with drapped bedsheets, mattresses, furniture, etc. \n\nThe responding agencies will talk tough to the public about how \"we don't negotiate\" but behind the scenes anything short of full amnesty and letting them leave the prison is on the table. Best case scenario, they negotiate an improvement in medical treatment and a few other categories and the ringleaders get hammered. \n\nI have no familiarity with illegal immigrant prisons, but I'd assume they will be less prone to escalate to violence due to the relatively minor sentences involved and the cross-section of society they encompass. More likely to have the kind of useful knowledge and skills that a typical inmate population would not, though. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "aSentId": 12771, "answer": "I'd hate to be the guy who has to go in there first.

The main limiting factor for the besieged is usually water, if policies haven't changed since I tactically GTFO of that blighted industry the SOP is to cut off water and electricity to the overrun buildings. \n\nCafeteria meals have been deliberately tweaked to primarily consist of things that don't keep long without refrigeration, so not much beyond corn bread and canteen goods are going to be edible after a few days. \n\nIf these were dormitories, the water situation is going to fuck them over significantly faster than food. Maybe a dozen toilets and sinks without drain plugs per every dormitory unit of one hundred people. Cellblocks are more sustainable, with one toliet holding about 1.5 gallons of water per two man cell. No clue about the tents. After about three days, the dehydration is going to be degrading the cognitive abilities and physical performance of the protestors involved. \n\nIt was hot and sunny today and will be tomorrow, so they'll probably be quite thirsty by Monday. If the organizers were really looking ahead, the weather forecast predicts rain on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday so collecting rainwater may allow the besieged to extend the time they can hold out. \n\nThese inmates aren't getting their meds as well. Wouldn't be surprised if we see a few deaths from diabetes, heart attacks, etc. Many old men in the system, and a lot of HIV/AIDs cases with compromised immune systems. \n\nThe lack of electricity also isolates the inmates; they can't use radios or watch TV to keep abreast of the public reaction to their uprising and see what kind of forces are being marshaled against them. The batteries of the smuggled cell phones they are using to coordinate efforts between units and contacts on the outside will steadily drain. Limits their weaponry as well; a Dixie cup full of syrup, sugar, and water boiled for twenty minutes in a microwave is a nightmarish thing to have thrown in someone's face and poured down armor. Same for using extension cords to electrify puddles of urine and the like. \n\nThe fact that they have no hostages is very surprising. You're looking at one unarmed officer at a desk, probably a middle aged woman, to one hundred inmates. Or two in each cellblock of a few dozen with 1-2 patrolling between units outside. It would be an absolute trivial manner to dogpile them and take them hostage, which makes me very curious about how things played out. The lack of hostages makes the strategy of just waiting out the rioter's supplies more viable. \n\nAny firearms the inmates have somehow gotten ahold of are going to have no reloads. Only armed guards are typically in towers or fields outside the wire, carrying a mix of Mini-14s, revolvers, lever action 30-30s, and pump action shotguns. From the sound of it the riot never made it anywhere they could obtain firearms and armor. Majority of weapons (if any) will be padlocks from personal lockers stuffed in socks, blades from broken disposable razors melted into toothbrushes, improvised brass knuckles, clubs, etc. \n\nThey'll try to create barricades everywhere and rearrange the interiors to slow down a storming of the buildings with drapped bedsheets, mattresses, furniture, etc. \n\nThe responding agencies will talk tough to the public about how \"we don't negotiate\" but behind the scenes anything short of full amnesty and letting them leave the prison is on the table. Best case scenario, they negotiate an improvement in medical treatment and a few other categories and the ringleaders get hammered. \n\nI have no familiarity with illegal immigrant prisons, but I'd assume they will be less prone to escalate to violence due to the relatively minor sentences involved and the cross-section of society they encompass. More likely to have the kind of useful knowledge and skills that a typical inmate population would not, though. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "aSentId": 12834, "answer": "Electrified puddles are for video games.

It's almost masterful.  \n  \nPrivate prisons are contracted to run a specified occupancy. If they don't meet these standards a fee is levied against the taxpayers of the state. Because of this they do in fact ship inmates to private prisons. Because of this, the average private prison has an occupancy rate 15-20% of that of public prisons in the same state. Because of this, per prisoner expenditures increase in public prisons. If the bare minimal overhead for a prison is, say for example, 1.5m a year regardless of prison occupancy because of operational costs of guards, medical staff, transport, electricity, maintenance etc. When you divide this number by the total occupants, of course the per prisoner cost is going to become convoluted. This number is naturally inflated to benefit the image of the private prison. This works as a double edged sword in favor of the private prison illusion. A) By threatening to levy taxes from tax payers, it convinces the state to move prisoners to your private prison, lowering the per inmate overhead cost, while driving up per inmate overhead cost of public prisons. B) Because of this tax levy the state is encouraged to move inmates as not to be taxed.  \n  \nThis creates the illusion that its more expensive to put inmates in public prisons, when the reality is that if private prisons didnt exist, occupancy of public prisons would be higher, lowering the per inmate cost. So your argument is that its somehow cheaper to house them privately. It isnt. Especially if occupancy isn't reached.

First, it's interesting that you attacked my initial response which was basically, \"research the topic, think critically, and draw your own conclusions.\"  I didn't even take an actual stance on the issue but you assumed it conflicted with your stance.  Why would you assume that anyone that suggests people think critically about climate change are immediately opposed to it?  For all you know, I could be one of it's biggest proponents.  But regardless of the topic, I would never insist someone simply accept it on faith, anyone that does is no different than a religious zealot.  If the conclusions drawn by climate scientists are incontrovertible, then you have nothing to fear from people thinking about it critically, we should all come to similar solutions.\nNow for my actual position on the topic, I absolutely believe that humans have effected the Earth's climate.  However, I question the long term impacts associated with these changes.  The only scenario that poses a real threat to humanity would be a runaway temperature increase... or decrease.  Anything else we can adapt to, especially with our current level of technology.  Regarding the runaway scenario though, I am quite confident it will not happen.  The reason is, our planet is a very large and extremely complex control system.  It has mechanisms built in to compensate for changes like this, they just operate over centuries and require more than an average human lifetime to work.  We have ample evidence of this in the geological record.  Hell, the Yucatan meteor set a large fraction of the planet on fire and increase volcanic activity for thousands of years dumping orders of magnitude more C02 in the atmosphere than what we are measuring today, and the planet compensated without a bit of human help.  \nI respect your passion on the topic, it means you care about the future of humanity, that's awesome.  I do as well.  I just want to make sure that the choices we make going forward on this issue make sense.  If it turns out there is no threat to our survival, then perhaps we should shift our focus to other things that pose threats to our survival that we can do something about.  One of those is meteor impacts.  We put a sad amount of time and effort into preparing for this and there is almost a 100% chance that the human race will be wiped out by one at some point in the future.  I'm not saying we abandon climate change research, I think more knowledge is always better.  I don't even care if oil companies fund the research because if the scientist is worth a damn they will add to the total available data on the topic.  They might draw stupid conclusions from this data but the data should still be valid and useful.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l", "qSentId": 14372, "question": "When it comes to global warming, there are not two questionable sides to the issue.

Clearly the overwhelming majority of these people pose no threat to national security- but that is the justification that is being used. If we had politicians who gave a shit about civil liberties they would be demanding the people subjected to this surveillance be informed. My guess is they're primarily targeting anyone who speaks out about any number of issues- whales being killed at Sea World (likely an animal rights extremist), the Keystone Pipeline (likely an environmental terrorist), etc. Shit, it wouldn't surprise me if agents are targeting people they don't like or who have beliefs that differ from their own. And because the target never finds out they've been monitored there is no recourse. The First Amendment is being gutted by this ever expanding surveillance state. Our Constitution is being ripped apart. When people know they are possibly being watched most will behave differently than they otherwise would. They feel less free to stand up and criticize the system- which is what the politicians (both Democrat and Republican) want.

While there are a plethora of illogical decision making on the job, as there is also a plethora of wise decision making, one cannot be in law enforcement contemplating the consequences of their actions when on the spot.\n\nWhat i'm getting as is that everyone is fallible and everyone is corruptible. Often it can be the leaders giving the okay, and NOT providing the checks and balances system an individual requires to stay sober in instinctive logic.

Here we have the most thorough documentation of the African ethnicity of the ancient people who developed the mathematics and sciences upon which modern civilization is based (Ethiopians, so-called Egyptians, Nubians, Sudanese, Colchis, etc.). Modern Africa is fucked not just because of greed and corruption but because of the long history of european exploitation.\n\nAfrica not only underpinned Europe's earlier development. Its palm oil, petroleum, copper, chromium, platinum and in particular gold were and are crucial to the later world economy. Only South America, at the zenith of its silver mines, outranks Africa's contribution to the growth of the global bullion supply.\n\nThe guinea coin paid homage in its name to the west African origins of one flood of gold. By this standard, the British pound since 1880 should have been rechristened the rand, for Britain's prosperity and its currency stability depended on South Africa's mines. I would wager that a large share of that gold in the IMF's vaults which was supposed to pay for Africa's debt relief had originally been stolen from that continent.\n\nThere are many who like to blame Africa's weak governments and economies, famines and disease on its post-1960 leadership.

Not my land, or your land, but THE land. \n\nThat said, I'm amazed when people refer to land as \"theirs\". It is the governments. While you might have some rights to control it, and a responsibility to be a good stewart of the land, it isn't yours, nor your family's. Don't believe me? Quit paying your property taxes, and you'll find out who owns 'your' land. \n\nThere is a much to be learned from that simple realization. There is a reason our forefathers said that our inalienable rights are for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness when the original philosophical writing was 'life, liberty, and the pursuit of property.' \n\nSeeing yourself as the 'little man' while you apparently have title to enough land to say your family has a 'forest' is either an oxymoron or hyperbole. The 'little man' would do well to understand the foundational principles and rights of our Constitution before trying to use its protections when they don't exist.

Where I've walked does matter if it proves that I'm no 'city boy' who doesn't have a connection with the land. \n\nI don't have land in trust, most \"little\" people dont. The fact that land can be held in trust, in my opinion, violates the intent of the rule against perpetuities which is to attempt to guarantee that land can't be consolidated into the hands of fewer and fewer. \n\nThat aside, I've stared down the barrel of more than one gun having been on the wrong side of someone's Ill informed but impassioned ideas of land boundaries and ownership. Passion doesn't make right, it just makes one volatile. \n\nAnd I fail to see how you're violating a trust if the government condemns the land. There is nothing that can be done to stop it, the only argument is for reimbursement at 'fair market value.' In fact, as a fiduciary that would be the definition of your job as trustee. Anyway, we're off point. \n\nMy point is that there is a substantial difference between *feeling* that you were wronged because you don't know or accept the basic tenants of the social construct under the Constitution, and actually *being* wronged. Only one of those positions had merit, as the responsible owner should know the extent of their ownership and rights, defending those against all but the sovereign. \n\nFurther, if due process isn't violated (meaning you were given notice, an opportunity for a hearing, and reimbursment if land was taken) then you haven't been wronged. You might feel that our Constitution should be altered because you don't like the effect of the 'taking' provisions on you ( I likely agree with you) but there is a known process to remedy that. If you can get enough people to side with you, you can fix your problem, but that's tough to do in a country of 100s of millions, many of whom don't 'own' an acre. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l", "qSentId": 17209, "question": "Buffet and Gates own the trains that currently transport the crude.
