It's not even remotely all about space adventure. Although if you do hold to that view, do tell how for example Gattaca or District 9 are really just modernized westerns.","aSentId": 21067,"answer": "Sci fi has evolved, but westerns are highly influential to its origins. \n\nGattaca is a modernized western in that he feels trapped in a sterile society and wants to experience true freedom. Westerns were often about the innocence and wonder lost by Man's need for technological growth, the taming of the wilderness also means taming ourselves. In Gattaca, Ethan Hawke is a rebel against a utopian society with a deep, hidden sadness. He is more alive than the superhumans all around him, just as Clint Eastwood is often portrayed as more alive than the mechanized society that slowly spreads west. One of the primary themes of Westerns are the loss of man's true nature at the hands of modernized society, which is exactly what Gattaca is about. \n\nDistrict 9 is a bit more difficult, but this story is about how morality breaks down when humans are confronted with the unknown. Sound familiar? How many westerns are about a morally ambiguous protagonist given the right to kill when a town is endangered by local marauders? He will often come out of retirement, against his better judgment, to go to war for \"the greater good.\" \n\nMass entertainment has definitely become darker since the early 70s, which was already death throes of the western. Many westerns are classic \"John Wayne:\" patriotic and simplistic. But the late westerns challenge the white washed morality of earlier entries into the genre. In many ways, District 9 is the classic western turned on its head. When the town comes under fire from a mysterious outside source, the hero must do what it takes to save everyone. However in District 9, the town itself is the danger, and the mysterious outside source is the one that needs saving. Our protag learns this, when initially anti-alien, he becomes one himself and is forced to understand their struggle. \n\nboom ","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh6e","qSentId": 21064,"question": "Sci fi is essentially to westerns as birds are to dinosaurs (according to Jurassic park)\n\nThe wilds have been tamed on earth, there's no romanticism to it anymore. \n\nStar Wars is extremely western, esp the original.

I was walking past the Museum of Natural History on my way home this summer and saw a submarine and a big crowd outside. I asked a guard what was up and he didn't want to tell me, but this excited dude on the steps waves me over. He explains that they're premiering James Cameron's new documentary inside and he's going to meet Cameron, asks if I want to tag along. I'm like, sure, why not, I'm not in a rush. \n\nWe get to talking and he starts explaining that he has hundreds of autographs. Met Will Smith last night and Bradley Cooper on Monday. Sat with Adam Sandler at a Knicks game. Dude is sort of a stereotypical nerd: a little odd, underweight, over-enthusiastic about his apparent hobby. I kinda wanna go, but can't gracefully get out of it. \n\nSo Cameron pulls up in his limo and gets out with his family. He's not taking pictures or saying hi, just walking up the steps to get inside. The dude I was standing with starts screaming, \"Please, please Mr. Cameron! I love all your work! I love Titanic and Terminator, I love Aliens, *please* come talk to me\". I seriously thought the guy was going to cry and security swarms the poor director to rush him into the building. Guy comes back over to my mortified ass and casually says that this happens all the time, some celebrities are just stuck up.

If there is a correlation between something and you think you can make money out of it as well as providing a great service to your customers, then good on you. \n\nAll Netflix is doing is proving that they're are running ideally. They are involved in a continually growing number of Netflix Original Series. They just got Kevin Spacey a Golden Globe, of which I cannot believe he finally fucking won one, for his work on HoC. Bojack Horseman is an extremely clever and amusing animated series that is heavy, has some strong adult themes and is actually quite touching and poignant. Haven't seen Orange is the New Black but from what I hear it's also extremely well done.\n\nI can't think of many bad things to say about Netflix. My only issues are the lack of titles available in Canada and the fact that Netflix barely exists outside of Canada and the US. It has a foothold in the UK but not nearly as strong as the US market, and I'm not even sure how many other countries they are in but I know that they're missing from some big ones.\n\n\nWell that and the whole thing of having a 'plan' on Netflix now. I'm not a huge fan of having to pay more to see HD, and if so I wish there was an option to just pay for the HD extra instead of having to get some plan with multiple viewers same account and what have you.

Premieres of shows tend to not be very fast paced since time needs to be spent building up the characters' motivations and showing what's at stake.  Both *Breaking Bad* and *Better Call Saul* start very similarly:  They show how beat down the main character is and how everything seems to be working against them.  While not exactly being the most action packed nor tension inducing plot, it's necessary for us to understand the direction the characters take.  I would never call the premiere of *Breaking Bad* anything other than good (otherwise I would've stopped watching it).
