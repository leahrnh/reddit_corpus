Three of your players were VERY tall (especially for their low weights) and the other two were of average non-athlete height. \n\nMy turn. I'm a Detroit Lions fan. DT Ndamukong Suh (who we're losing to the Dolphins :(  ) is 307 lbs. The QB Matt Stafford is 232 lbs. The team has players from 185 lb to 340 lb. THAT is a range. In height, the team ranges from 6'9\" to 5'9\", admittedly similar to your range of just 5 soccer players. \n\nYour stats point I can't argue with, maybe I just don't understand them. \n\nThe buildup point though....an NFL game is measured in yards. There is a reward for marching down the field but not scoring, and that reward is field position. There's a reason why when a team is within the 20 yard line of the opposing endzone it is called \"the redzone\". In soccer there doesn't seem to be much contesting the flow of the ball over the middle 2/3 of the pitch.

I don't get how being lighter and faster than say Julian Savea or even Patrick Osborne means that Peterson will automatically blow through these men. They're paid to take people bigger than him down for a living, it won't be much of an ask. I've taken down men heavier than him, and I'm a decidedly amateur player, so I can imagine players of international calibre can handle someone with his explosive capabilites. \n\nAnyway, point being I regret posting my opinion here, it's very much \"if the USA cared we would dominate in a few years\". NFL and college football players are brilliant in their own game with their own skillsets and physical capabilites, who's to say they would ever be as fast or as powerful as they are now, if they grew up playing a sport that simply doesn't require it. There's a reason rugby players 100m times and other numerical stats aren't common knowledge to the worldwide fans base, and it's because it doesn't matter. \n\nWe can argue all we want, but both parties will remain steadfast in their belief, either that NFL players would destroy the rugby world, or that they would be a laughing stock for decades.

You have to touch all the bases along the way, they're like check points. Baseball is a turn-based game, and the teams take turns being the batting team and fielding team.   \n\nWhen you are the batter, the baseball is your enemy, it's what gets you out. (3 outs = the other team gets their turn.) As soon as you hit the ball, the baseball becomes \"hot\" to you, and any fielder that has the ball in his glove has a hot glove. If a fielder has a hot glove and steps on a base, the base becomes hot too. You cannot touch a hot glove or base, or else you get burned and you're out. Gloves and bases are hot as long as the ball is physically in that glove. Everywhere is a danger zone where you can potentially get burned by a hot glove. The only safe places where you can't get burned are the bases, but only if it still cold when you arrive! When you reach a cold base and choose to not attempt to get to the next base, the play is over and it's the next batter's turn. You get to continue your lap around the diamond if he hits the ball, and you're both in danger of getting burned.   \n\nSo as a batter, your goal is to hit the ball to as inconvenient a place for the fielding team as possible, in order to maximize your team's chances of reaching a still-cold base. Since each batter only gets X attempts to hit the ball, the pitcher's goal is to try to throw the ball in such a way so as you can't hit it and get you out that way. All the fielders' goal is to burn you by passing the ball to one another.   \n\nOf course, there's much more, but that's the basic goal of the gameplay.
