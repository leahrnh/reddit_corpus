We were in a bathroom with no one else, no cameras, so no one else could have seen/heard. I agreed, walked out of the bathroom and turned a corner, and immediately got grabbed by the school security guard and taken to the office for a search -- which makes me think it was a setup. The principal really disliked me because they would see me smoking cigarettes across the street from school, but when searched I never had cigs or a lighter on me so they couldn't do anything about it. \n\nThey found the pills and I was arrested. Turns out they were Valium, and possessing prescription pills that aren't yours is a felony. I get to court, and in addition to that charge, I was also being charged with possession of marijuana and paraphernalia, neither of which I ever had on me, as well as intoxication (which I wasn't). I assume they added the bullshit charges to make sure it got before a judge and didn't just get dropped since it was a first offense. \n\nMy parents and I asked the PD what to do. He said \"did you do what they say you did? Can you prove you didn't have the pills on you?\" We said, \"well, yes, but not the rest of it, and they weren't even mine, and I definitely didn't do the rest of it\". I didn't have any priors, but we took the PD's advice to plead guilty because we didn't know what else to do. I ended up getting 6 months in juvie, a $3000 fine (which my parents had to pay, since 14-year-old me sure didn't have that money), and two years of probation. \n\nOh, and also, little-known fact: in my state, parents have to pay the state for a child's room and board if they're in juvie. It was something like $1500/month at the time. Luckily, I didn't have to serve the entire 6 months, but it still ended up being a ton of money on top of the I initial fine. \n\nA few years later, a friend of the family who was a lawyer told us that had I plead not guilty and fought it, I likely could have gotten off with just informal probation (no probation officer, basically it's just \"don't get arrested again within this time frame, or original charges will be reinstated \") or a small fine.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l", "qSentId": 15874, "question": "If you have money you get good representation.

They claimed I had to wait until I got to jail but the cops replied  \"the arresting officer should have done that. We're not allowed.\"\n\nI requested a trial-by-jury but the paperwork never showed so a few months after being arrested, I call to find out what the holdup was only to discover there was a bench warrant out for my arrest. It turned out they had the wrong address for me and yet I was still threatened with 30 days of jail for missing my court date. Fortunately I was able to evade that and got a new court date.\n\nI show up for my court date and surprise, surprise, trial by judge. Oh, and he wouldn't let me request a trial by jury on account of \"having skipped my last court date.\" I was ultimately found guilty because the cop said \"she smelled alcohol on my breath\" and that I \"was being belligerent and hostile.\" I guess getting jacked up by her 6'5\"+ partner and being told that I \"would get fucked up if I said another word\" is being hostile.\n\nThe weekend in jail cost me my job because I was scheduled to work and had no way of contacting them, it caused me to miss an exam on Monday morning and subsequently fail it after finally showing up smelling like ass because I hadn't studied, and it has cost me jobs since because it is still on my record.\n", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l", "qSentId": 16240, "question": "It doesn't matter if you have a lawyer or not when you've been held unlawfully for a period of time that severely impacts your personal life.

I was on the road just before the one leading to the festival entrance, with a cop behind me, when I made the turn to the festival road - and was immediately pulled over.  \n  \nThe cop told me he pulled me over because I had crossed the yellow line when I made my left turn. He asked if I had been using any drugs. I kind of laughed because I'm actually straight edge, and have been my whole life. So obviously, I said no. He didn't believe me, however. He asked for my license and registration. Being that it's been over ten years, I can't recall the exact specifics of this part, but I recall that the car was actually registered to my father (I lived at home, it was his but he let me use it). Anyway, that was some kind of flag for the cop and he said he'd need to do something else. Basically, he didn't believe me and was insinuating that I had stolen the car (from my Dad, no less). So I sat waiting in my car for a while. He came back and again asked me about the drugs. I again said I had not done any drugs.  \n  \nI was next asked to step out of the car. I was told to sit on the side of the road. By this time, more cops had arrived for backup. Others were arriving to the festival and seeing me on the side of the road. I was told by the cops that drug dogs were on their way to find the drugs in my car. Again, I reiterated there weren't any. He tried to \"reason\" with me, telling me that there were two kinds of drug dogs: the kind that alert silently, and the kind that will scratch the shit out of the spot they find drugs. He was warning me because, if it was the latter kind of dog, I'd have to explain to my father why his car was all scratched up. At this point, I basically told him to go for it, because I knew there were no drugs in the car.  \n  \nI waited a long ass time and dogs finally showed up. He gave me \"one last chance\" and I of course had nothing to reveal to him, so the dogs went about their business. The cops also went through my car, including the trunk, and rifling through foods (like some boxed cereal) I had brought (it was a 5-day music festival; I was meeting friends and we were camping out).  \n  \nIn the end, the officer produced a seed he said he had found on the floor of the passenger side of the car. He said, if he wanted to, he could \"run it down to the lab\" to test it. I told him it most likely was a sesame seed that fell off a burger I ate on the way to Ohio and that, alternatively, he could let me go the half mile down the road to the festival and never see me again.

A white only clothing line would be berated by the media until it was forced out of business. And a college that gave white people extra points for being white would be protested, and I wouldn't be surprised to see violence break out. But when you flip it around, nobody gives a shit. Are you proud to be black? Good, you should be proud of your heritage. Wear it on your clothes, tattoo it on your body, shout it from the fucking rooftops. But if you are proud to be white, you are a racist. Get a white pride tattoo and you might as well be a part of the fucking KKK as far as anybody is concerned. That is just the way it is nowadays.

But right now, there are more slaves than there were before the civil war started, and most of those slaves are bought and sold by people we consider to be minorities in America. But its happening far away, so we just ignore it. Anyway, back to the college thing. Some people argue that the extra points for black people is because a lot of black people were raised in areas with a bad education system, and therfor they deserve some help. And I'm all for helping out people who had no control over that situation. But the thing is, not all black people had a bad education, and not all white people had a good one. I went to your typical American high school, nothing crazy. No gang activity to speak of, no real fights, and most of the kids passed. Does it make sense that a black kid who went to that school should be given extra points over the white kids he went to school with, simply because he is black? Of course not. And if a white kid grows up in a shitty area, and goes to a shitty school, and gets a shitty education, should he be denied extra help simply because he was born white? Of course not.

Just about every network buys shows", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l", "qSentId": 20322, "question": "They dont make shows, they buy them. Why dont people understand this? They arent a studio. ", "aSentId": 20325, "answer": "The key is that they guarantee to buy them. This lets the production company go out and get the financing to make the show as the financiers know that the network is good for the money. Except that with far fewer advertising dollars they can't pay as much plus the financiers are no longer 100% certain that the networks can pay. While they are new financiers can be far more certain that Netflix will pay than many of the now fragile cable channels. I wouldn't make a bet that OWN, HGTV, or CNN would pay a large bill 1 year from now, thus I wouldn't effectively loan money to someone who depended upon any of them paying. I would bet on HBO or Netflix paying their bills a year from now.\n\nThis weakness is corrosive to the quality of their programming which is corrosive to the number of viewers, which is corrosive value of their advertising, which is also corrosive to the number of cable subscribers which is corrosive to all of the above.\n\nBut also the networks effectively do make shows. No ABC show would have a script that really shit on Disney, or the concept of organized religion, or so on. The networks will actively participate in script reviews, selecting actors, plus even chose producers, etc. The \"independent\" production companies are rarely left alone. Netflix has famously handed the money over and told them to just have at it. While this will almost certainly have the occasional failure I suspect that it will produce some awesome content most of the time.\n\nThen there are the interesting aspects of working on a show without a network (ad driven) set of problems. For instance shows really can't be spending too much time shitting on car companies as they are always major advertisers. Also product placements are very dangerous in network television especially for beer as that is another major TV advertiser. \n\nI am willing to bet that in Netflix shows you will see more and more negative general comments on beer and cars. Comments that would never air on ABC, CBS, NBC. \n\n", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l", "qSentId": 20322, "question": "They dont make shows, they buy them. Why dont people understand this?

I think that the knee jerk reaction is for most people to say \"Well of course it does\" but I'm not sure that is actually the case if you consider marriage an inherently unfair system.  \n\nI mean, if marriage is an inherently unfair system that runs counter to the liberty of the populace as a whole, expanding it doesn't see to be advancing freedom.\n\nJust look at legal implications, for instance.  In many states, a man can rape a small child, admit it to their wife, and she would be under no obligation to testify against him if they were married 30 seconds prior to his admission.\n\nThat seems inherently unfair and against the interests of liberty from the perspective of the victim.\n\nExpanding marriage laws to allow *more* people access to this freedom from testimony can serve to result in *less* fairness and *less* liberty.\n\nSame thing with taxes.  I have a good friend who came from a very abusive household.  He watched his dad beat the shit out of his mom everyday as a child.  As a result, he has pretty much zero ability to engage in normal healthy relationships and is unlikely to ever get married.\n\nBecause of that, he is going to pay a higher effective tax rate for the rest of his life than the national average for his level of earnings because of tax advantages given out based on marriage.\n\nAgain, that seems pretty unfair and against the interests of liberty.  Again, expanding that so that even more people get lower tax rates resulting in him paying an *even more disproportionate* share of the nation's expenses compared to the average seems to be decidedly against fairness and liberty.\n\n&gt;That said, I don't think many people who are against gay marriage, evolution and sex ed. in school, etc. are advancing an inspired \"all or nothing\" libertarian position.

Every time we had court, I was warned by the judge not to miss it, unless I wanted a bench warrant issued for me. Never, ever, did he repeat the same warning to her.

Yeah, that shit doesn't happen anymore if the father can prove he's a capable parent and can give the kid a stable home. \n\nIt's nice to know the wheels of justice finally got some shit right in all of this.

Firstly - who executed this study? Is it peer reviewed? The article doesn't even provide a link or title.\n\n&gt;A new report concludes that between 95% and 98.5% of all incarcerations in Massachusetts...from 2001 through 2011 have been men... It is likely that most of these incarcerations are for incomplete payment of child support.\n\nWhy is this \"likely\"? Incarceration can result from almost any crime: assault, robbery, trespassing, murder, etc. Why is it assumed that most instances involve child support? \n\nAt one point in the article, they compare male incarceration rates for *general crime* in *Massachusetts* to *national* data on incarceration for *failure to pay child support*. They're comparing two different populations and two different reasons for incarceration - and treating them as the same. \n\n&gt;Based on national data, if incarceration for non-payment of child support occurred at equal rates...88% of those incarcerated would be men, not 95% to 98.5%\n\nThe statement that \"men are jailed 8 times the rate of women\" is therefore invalid. (It's concluded through the comparison of the general rate of incarceration of women in Massachusetts to the national percentage of women in arrears for child support: 1.5% and 12%).\n\nAnd what's more - using that logic and *the same data*, you could just as easily say that women are incarcerated 2.4 times that of men (based on the 95 - 98.5% incidence of male incarceration; instead of comparing 1.5% to 12%, why not use 5%?)

It's the sheer tone or instant judgment that used to throw me off.  \n\nBTW the term 'custody' has several different meanings. I did/do have joint legal custody meaning we are both legally able to make decisions for our children medically and educationally, which was very useful at times. \n\nI do think over the past 15 years or so that the Courts are starting to slowly move away from the \"Mother\" favoritism and more leaning towards what's in the best interest for children more than just being stated as rhetoric.\n\nBut the system is very broken in so many areas and ways.

Don't be so quick to judge. \n\nIn inter-state support cases, such like mine is, the child support formula is based in the state my ex and my children live in and the state I live in enforces.  \n\nOne thing I have noticed, is how adversarial the system is, and how the non-custodian parent can be in the middle of a legal nightmare - such as my ex who went on disability told the state where he applied that I was in arrears.  He deliberately did this and admitted he wanted to double his income because 'he could'.  So I had two child support obligations open in two states for about 6 months.   Nothing happened to him. \n\nIt all depends on the state as to how enforcement goes; I have a coworker who has a father of her child that owes upwards of $30k and she can't get them to do anything to enforce.  Me, well, my state has almost zero tolerance.  Those six months during my ordeal I looked at possible jail, losing my license, etc.  \n\nI definitely didn't feel any sense of leniency because I'm a woman in any of my experiences with child support. If anything, there's been times that my ex openly admitted he just sees me as a tax free source of income. \n\nAs to my relationship with my children, it wasn't easy especially because their step-mother tried to alienate me from them.

Some places have sane and reasonable policies regarding child support. Some juridctions are completely overzealous and do not give two shits  whether you lost your job or are making much less than you used too. There are some cities where the jails are full of poor men locked up because they can't find a job and thus can't pay child support. There are other cities where it's almost impossible to force someone to pay owed child support.\n\nThere needs to be the same reasonable and sane guidelines everywhere. Locking someone up should be an absolute last resort only used in cases where it's abundantly clear the delinquent person has plenty of money to pay but is merely hiding assets. For everyone else just garnish a reasonable portion of their wages. You can't garnish wages when they're in jail. If someone simply doesn't have a job then it's absolutely inhumane locking them up over money they don't even have.

Of course they can't afford the payments so they get charged with contempt and failure to provide (California Penal Code 166 and 270, respectively). Then they go to jail and lose their job. Then the court orders them to submit \"seek work\" forms which require them to submit proof to the Dept of Child Support Services (DCSS) that they've applied to at least 5 jobs every two weeks.

Even paying $1 shows good faith to the court that you are trying to make good on the court's order. \n\n(2) if you don't have a job and are ordered to submit seek work reports, just apply to any job in your area (even if it's fast food). This also goes a long way with the court. \n\n(3) do NOT give your children money outside of child support, especially if you can't afford to make the monthly payments. Any money you give them should go through the DCSS system so there is proof of the money you gave them. \n\n(4) always ask for a public defender to help you out on your case.

So if you absolutely cannot pay, and have a good reason or reasons for not paying, make the DA take the case to trial. I've won many trials based solely on the willfulness requirement. \n\n(7) Important EDIT- always try and modify your support order so that it reflects your current income.

I'm a public defender and part of my misdemeanor work is defending dads who are being charged with contempt of court for \"disobeying\" a court order. \n\nIt is one of the worst cycles I've seen in the criminal justice system. In family court these dads are usually not represented (because they can't afford an attorney) and are slapped with a ridiculous monthly child support bill. Of course they can't afford the payments so they get charged with contempt and failure to provide (California Penal Code 166 and 270, respectively). Then they go to jail and lose their job. Then the court orders them to submit \"seek work\" forms which require them to submit proof to the Dept of Child Support Services (DCSS) that they've applied to at least 5 jobs every two weeks.  If they don't do that then they face more jail time. The system is so stacked against obligors- men and women alike (I regularly represent both sexes, however I do represent more men than women). Then the \"arrears\" add up with interest accumulating every month. It is not at all uncommon for my clients to owe over $100k to DCSS for their unpaid support. \n\nHere's what you should do if you are trapped in this system in California: \n\n(1) always pay whatever you can against your monthly child support. Even paying $1 shows good faith to the court that you are trying to make good on the court's order. \n\n(2) if you don't have a job and are ordered to submit seek work reports, just apply to any job in your area (even if it's fast food). This also goes a long way with the court. \n\n(3) do NOT give your children money outside of child support, especially if you can't afford to make the monthly payments. Any money you give them should go through the DCSS system so there is proof of the money you gave them. \n\n(4) always ask for a public defender to help you out on your case. Too often I see obligors refuse my assistance because they think they can do it on their own. Just face it: unless you are an attorney just assume I know more than you do about your options. It's the same thing as me asking for your help when I need electrical work done on my house. When your freedom is at risk always get a lawyer. \n\n(5) don't automatically take a plea deal -  even if there is no jail time involved. Your plea deal will contain a promise to pay your child support (with arrears and interest added each month). If you cannot pay this then your probation will be violated and you will surely do jail time. Always put the case over to give yourself opportunities to pay. I regularly see my clients earn dismissals for doing just this.\n\n(6) remember, in California, at least, a finding of contempt requires the judge to find that you willfully disobeyed the court's orders. So if you absolutely cannot pay, and have a good reason or reasons for not paying, make the DA take the case to trial. I've won many trials based solely on the willfulness requirement. \n\n(7) Important EDIT- always try and modify your support order so that it reflects your current income. If you are making less money your child support needs to be modified! So many of my clients fail to do this and end up in trouble. Because they can no longer afford their support they just stop paying altogether. \n\nTo all of you sending me angry messages:  please take notice that I in no way am advising people to not pay their support.

Would it be okay with you if neither parent accepted responsibility and just let the kid starve or the state take over? \n\nIf your a parent, your responsibility should be your kids.

Allow me to summarize: I have a daughter made in one country, born in another, and since she was born I talked to the mother to settle the amount I could afford based on my wage. She didn't settle and went to court. She thought that, because my father invested in a small Subway restaurant, I was rich. I'm not. Worse: I am working on the most penalized sector of the Portuguese crisis you maybe heard-Restaurants. Long story short: the court didn't even hear me to settle the temporary amount I was to give monthly to my daughter. And because the picture was painted to the judge only by my daughter's mother, it was WAY above what I could and still can afford. What happened? The government from my country took everything I had in my name and ordered I couldn't use it, pending public sale. The most important thing: my 2 seat 15 year old car that I desperately needed to buy groceries, the base of my work. And from that time on, family had to help, my debt rose, my company was contacted to grab a percentage of my wage, all while the case is still not over (almost 3 years later!). I can say I feel heavily under depression, spent whole days not wanting to leave the house and not knowing if the sun was up or down. If it wasn't for friends and some family, that after more than a year slowly helped me live again with dignity and try constantly to prove that I DO want the best for my daughter but I can't just give more than I am able and stay to live on the streets, I would be a BIG MESS. To conclude: no, my daughter's mother still isn't working, but that didn't and still doesn't matter for a justice system that puts the blame and responsibility on the father and the receiving end always being the mother (either financially or with respect to rights towards time and custody).

Of course since I don't see the kids every day I feel like I have this obligation to take them places that cost money.   \n\nSo even though I have been paying $1174 per month in monthly child support, $195 per month for arrears, $400 in insurance, $500 a month on direct expenses on the children, and honor my visitation schedule, I am by definition a \"deadbeat\" parent due to the fact that I am in arrears.\n       ", "aSentId": 26388, "answer": "&gt;  I was also about $14k in arrears, since it took about a year to modify the court agreement.\n\nYou do know that if you were paying the father during that entire year, even if a formal agreement wouldn't have been made at that point, then you could show those payments to a judge and not have been in arrears?

So, while we may have societal expectations of men working, this isn't simply an issue about lack of sympathy for deadbeat males -- this is about deadbeats regardless of gender.  Further, many single mothers also work.\n\nAs to the latter point, the system may be imperfect.  But actions have consequences.  Don't have kids you can't pay for.  If you are ordered to pay child support, bust your ass and work multiple jobs.  They don't cease to be your responsibility.  The kids very well aren't going to work.\n\n&gt; Call him names to further dehumanize him- nice. Yeah, that monkey got what was coming to him, right?

He and every other person like him *is* a deadbeat, though.  As for Scott, in particular, he couldn't pay child support but he could afford to drive a Mercedes Benz (see the arrest video).  So, he was a selfish piece of shit.  If you need further proof that he's a piece of shit just look at his lengthy criminal history (which includes both violent crimes and drug arrests).  So, sell your story about him being a hard working but unlucky chap somewhere else.  He didn't deserve to be shot but he was no pillar of the community.\n\n&gt; He was shot in the back and had a weapon planted on him.

It was next to impossible to enforce the child support payments, because there is A LOT of legal recourse for the noncustodial parent.\n\nSorry to hear that -- nobody deserves a parent who doesn't want to take responsibility for their children.  However, times have changed, and enforcement is huge with very little legal recourse, these days.  Fall a few months behind and your license is suspended, and it only gets worse from there.\n\n&gt; Also, most state that use \"ability to earn\" do have provisions for dropping incomes - it's not that uncommon a problem, and it is usually possible to figure it out. Sometimes it isn't, and that's obviously fucked.\n\nThe provisions for reduction in income are draconian.  Income usually needs to drop by 15-20% or more in order to qualify to petition for a reduction, and proof needs to be shown that it was at no fault of your own.  Took a position at work that was a paycut, but has more growth potential and future income?  Too bad, it was voluntary.  Hated your job and your life, and wanted to change careers?  Too bad, it's your fault.\n\nEven if it wasn't voluntary, most states require you to provide proof that you're making a legitimate effort to find additional income, either via a new job, or an extra job, to qualify for a *temporary* reduction.\n\n&gt;About the other thing: It's hard to earn money. We all know this. But you got to take care of your kid. That does come first. I'd rather the noncustodial parent goes hungry than the kid, is what it comes down to.\n\nLet's use an example to display why this is bad logic.  If you have a married couple with one kid, and one parent loses their job, the other parent picks up more hours to help cover the gap, and the whole family unit finds a way to survive.\n\nHowever, with a divorced couple and a kid, if the noncustodial parent loses their job, why do we expect them to go hungry, while the custodial parent has no expectation of stepping up?  Raising a child should take two people.  The expectation with a split family that one person cover a hard number of support costs regardless of their personal circumstances is absolutely absurd.  \n\nTaking it even further, there are living expenses that are absolutely necessary for the noncustodial parent to provide for their child and be a good parent.  Are we really okay with an NCP becoming homeless, losing their car, and being on the street because, well, \"the kid always comes first!\"\n\n&gt; All I'm trying to say is: Child support is not the problem here.\n\nNo, but child support laws *are* the problem.  The reason so many people skip out on child support isn't because they don't want to support their kids, it's because they can't *afford* to pay child support.  The system takes a large percentage of their income without any regards to living expenses.\n\nFurthermore, and I'll probably get downvoted for this, but all other things being equal, primary custody should go to the parent by default that is able to financially support the children.  You wanna know what's *really* unfair and hurts?  Having a court grant primary custody to the mother because she doesn't work full time, and you do, so she has more time to spend with the kids until they go to school -- and then being ordered to pay $1000 in support.  \"Hey, not only do you not get to see your kids as much as you want, you're now in charge of financing the custodial parent's ability to support them!\"", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l", "qSentId": 27633, "question": "He was $8000 in debt before he went to jail.

Everything from custody, to visitations, to asset distribution and any other kinds of calculations the court has to obtain in ruling on cases of child custody, support, or visitations is strongly in favor of the mother in almost all circumstances.

When he comes back from deployment, his wife and he decide to divorce.  Keep in kind that both the man and woman have good legal standing with the law, and neither of them are in any way unable to care for the child.

The only thing the man gets is visitation rights, and joint legal custody of the child.  \n\nMy point is, the system is set up to disenfranchise the man in any child custody/ child support scenario from the get go, without any regard or due process as far as the woman getting the legal favor for no other reason then \"she is the mother\".\n\nIt's complete bullshit.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l", "qSentId": 28984, "question": "You're kinda like the people that say potheads need to all go to jail because they broke the law. \"It doesn't matter if it's right, they broke the law.

Meanwhile my teeth are crooked and fucked up while my younger sister couldn't see shit until she got into middle school.
