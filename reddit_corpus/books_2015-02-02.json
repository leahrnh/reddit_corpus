If Harry kills Voldemort then Voldemort doesn't survive so Harry can live. \n\nIf you think about it, it is exactly how Voldemort interpreted it. He had all these plans to be immortal and then this prophecy pops up which says Harry is going to be the death of him. So he thinks if the only one who can kill him is dead then he can be immortal. And goes to kill him before Harry becomes powerful enough. This alternate ending only switched characters if you ask me.","aSentId": 12498,"answer": "It's a fair point, but for one, that entirely ignores that the book made a big deal about prophecies merely reflecting the circumstances that lead to truths, not binding the truths themselves. Which is to say that Harry and Voldemort were always going to be each other's demises once Voldemort believed the prophecy to be true, not because the prophecy held some controlling magic over them, but because the circumstances pitted them against each other. Yes, Voldemort believes that killing Harry will in effect ensure that he remains immortal (because no one left standing will be able to stop him), but he never believes that the *act* of killing Harry is what grants the immortality. He attributed that to his horcruxes, entirely separate from the prophecy.\n\nWith regard to the alternate version, it doesn't conflict the prophecy directly, I agree. But it reads something into the prophecy that is explicitly missing from the language. Again, the prophecy says \"for neither can live while the other survives\", not \"for neither can die while *insert condition*\". One can argue that immortality is a viable result of the prophecy (although that doesn't make sense for the reasons I just went into above), but to say that the prophecy actually foretells it like this alternative ending implies? That's just simply not supported by the language.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh4i","qSentId": 12436,"question": "She is awesome.

According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_fiction_authors) JK has sold 350M books, Christy sold 2 billion. I guess it must be inflation -- the average price of Christy's books was likely a fraction of the much later books. ","aSentId": 12865,"answer": "Five Reasons:\n\n1. Merchandizing. This is the biggest reason. There aren't a lot of Hercule Poirot action figures. And the Agatha Christie video games aren't exactly bestsellers (and -- of course -- didn't exist while she was alive). Nor is there much market for posters, DVDs, etc. Nobody buys Poirot Magnifying Glasses, but there's an entire store in Universal that sells nothing but Harry Potter wands.\n\n2. Licensing. I touched on this with Universal, but there are two Harry Potter sections in Universal Studios Orlando (one in Islands of Adventure, one in Universal Studios). These bring in a fortune, and she gets a substantial cut. But that's not it: the Harry Potter characters are enormously powerful cultural symbols, and the ability to license them to megacorporations is enormously lucrative.\n\n3. The Films. There were a bunch of Christie movies/TV shows/etc., but none as big as any of the Harry Potter films. And the films serve as a multimillion dollar marketing campaign for the merchandizing and licensing.\n\n4. Inflation. Christie was writing these books during a time in which the British pound was worth a whole lot more. 1 British pound in 1950 is worth about 29 British pounds now. Which means if Christie made 34 million pounds, she had -- in today's terms -- a billion pounds. For her to qualify as a billionaire, she would have had to earn the equivalent of 29 billion pounds.\n\n5. Digital Publishing Rights. When JK Rowling sold the publishing rights to Harry Potter, she retained the digital publishing rights. This means that JK Rowling herself is the publisher of Harry Potter ebooks (and that's why you can only buy them on Pottermore or through Pottermore stores on places like Amazon). Typically, an author gets between 10 and 30% of the book cost, while a publisher gets the rest of the money. In an actual printing, this might make sense, as the publisher has a lot of printing expenses, but in a digital sale, it's basically a windfall for the publisher. Instead of only getting 30% of the ebook price, JK Rowling gets closer to 70%.\n\nSecuring the eBook Publishing Rights is perhaps the greatest stroke of genius for Rowling (or -- more likely -- her agent). They were able to identify an element of her contract that the publisher massively undervalued (because eBooks were in their infancy) and secure the rights for this.\n\nThis deal is akin to George Lucas's move to secure 100% of the Star Wars merchandizing rights (much more than Rowling has).

Even before he rapped, he was highly regarded for his work in the instrumental components of hip hop music. In fact, he was such a perfectionist that his first album was delayed three times as he was constantly refining the string arrangements, drum programming, etc.\n\nLastly, he's probably one of the most influential artists of the modern day, in terms of style. His meticulously produced, more introspective work helped bring about a new direction in hip hop, away from the popular \"hardcore gangsta\" style of before. As *the Guardian* described the sales competition between 50 Cent and him: \"[the competition] highlighted the diverging facets of hip-hop in the last decade; the former was gangsta rap for the noughties, while West was the thinking man's alternative.\"\n\nAs controversial as he is, the man is certainly skilled, and with both rave reviews on each album and chart-topping sales, his name will be remembered for a long time.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh4i","qSentId": 13476,"question": "Kanye West is only \"good\" if you can tolerate rap.

If you think it sold for any other reason than Fifty shades of Grey, you are pretty naive.","aSentId": 13715,"answer": "It's virtually the opposite of na\u00efvet\u00e9. It was pretty obvious that Sade sought to achieve multiple literary and philosophical goals with Justine. Philosophically, it was about morality and how Justine who sought to be a virtuous girl was tormented by everyone around her  whereas Juliette sought to be highly immoral and led a happy, fulfilling life. Sade was a radical atheist who was hostile to the religious values at the time and wanted to show the superficiality of the Christian virtuous life as well as the hypocrisy of the clergy who propagated those values. Many of Justine's tormentors were members of the clergy.\n\nThis was a reflection Sade made on French society in his time. Sade was raised by his bishop uncle as a youth who Sade saw get put in jail multiple times for things like flogging prostitutes but was always let go because of his church position. Not to mention the decadent aristocracy and many other clergy who got away with horrid crimes (literally murder at times) because of their positions. An example would be [Charles the Count of Charolais](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles,_Count_of_Charolais). These aristocrats and clerics would be inspirational for the criminal libertines in 120 Days of Sodom.\n\n&gt; In one particular instance, in the street and in front of witnesses, this nobleman, a relative of the king, fired his pistol and killed, coldly and without reason other than his own pleasure, a man who had the misfortune of being within reach of his weapon. The regent Philippe d'Orl\u00e9ans was truly shocked by this heinous crime, and summoned the count to say that, while he could not punish him on account of his rank, he would willingly forgive anyone who took reciprocal action.\n\nSade was a social critic and a philosopher and his writings show this quite clearly to anyone who scratches just below the surface. The same cannot be said for Stephanie Meyer as the sole goal of 50 Shades is for arousal. Justine itself was written in the classical style and was never intended as erotica.\n\n**TL;DR** - You could say that Justine is just a book about a 12 year old sex slave, just like you could also say 1984 was about a civil servant's sex dream come true, or Thus Spoke Zarathustra is about a wild man from the mountains, but these pieces of literature go beyond the surface if you care to approach them without a na\u00efve mindset. 50 Shades on the other hand has no such literary or philosophical depth and is more akin to mass market vodka to be consumed for intoxication rather than a Ch\u00e2teau Rothschild that ought to be savoured.

I just know that they tended to be both pushy and snobbish if you didn't like or had no interest in reading those books, and many of them liked to interrupt my reading time on my lunch break to nag me to read the books they loved while completely ignoring my attempts at explaining that neither book was a topic that fit my interests, so thanks but no thanks.\n\nOf course the funny thing was that if they kept it up I *did* start picking on whatever book they were bugging me about, which I could do because when they first started getting popular I'd read reviews, both positive and negative, to see whether I'd be interested in them.  Whereas with my books, they'd never heard of any of them (not bragging, they were neither obscure nor highbrow, just again happened to live in the middle of a batch of people who'd never heard of them), so they were completely unable to fight back.  That shut them up.  At least until the next 'new reader' with an attitude was born from reading Twilight or 50 Shades!\n\nI did run into a few women who *were* open-minded enough to accept my explanations as to why I hadn't bothered reading the books, and continue on to discuss other books or just the pleasure of reading in general.  I really loved talking with them, and I loved being able to point them toward other books they might enjoy.  Laurell K. Hamilton, for instance, is another author I have no personal interest in, but I happened to have been friends with a *huge* fan of the Anita Blake series in the past, so I knew the gist of the books and knew they'd be a pretty safe bet (and were, I got a few THANK YOU!!s from a couple girls who might never have run across them otherwise).","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh4i","qSentId": 13723,"question": "this is still a really dumb way to look at it.\n\n50 shades is not non fiction. it has no responsibility to stay true to reality.\n\nwhy that would 'concern' you is beyond me. do you get 'concerned' about porn that has the lonely housewife banging the plumber, because in real life the housewife is faithful and the plumber is not a muscle-bound stud?\n\n","aSentId": 13724,"answer": "I don't judge people for reading whatever they want it's more a critique of the author or work.

But today, the works of Wilkie Collins and Sherlock Holmes are considered valuable contributions because they intoduced the genre of thriller to mainstream.\n\nGoing further back, one can see similar patterns for romance, drama etc. Jane Austen and even Shakespeare gained popularity in the same way amidst criticism of being \"cheap\" or \"light\".\n\nDuring our generation as well, \"magic\" books like LOTR, Harry Potter etc. were considered \"cheap\" simply because they are fantasy. But now, we are gradually considering these to be valuable contributions as well. Fantasy and Sci-Fi, which used to be a very closed niche amongst some people only, are becoming mainstream.\n\nBooks like 50 shades of gray might be crap, but it introduces a new genre to mainstream, a genre that was hidden as a mere guilty pleasure which no one talked about earlier.

These include: Thinks, Knows, Understands, Realizes, Believes, Wants, Remembers, Imagines, Desires, and a hundred others you love to use.\n\nThe list should also include: Loves and Hates.\n\nAnd it should include: Is and Has, but we\u2019ll get to those later.\n\nUntil some time around Christmas, you can\u2019t write: Kenny wondered if Monica didn\u2019t like him going out at night\u2026\u201d\n\nInstead, you\u2019ll have to Un-pack that to something like: \u201cThe mornings after Kenny had stayed out, beyond the last bus, until he\u2019d had to bum a ride or pay for a cab and got home to find Monica faking sleep, faking because she never slept that quiet, those mornings, she\u2019d only put her own cup of coffee in the microwave. Never his.\u201d\n\nInstead of characters knowing anything, you must now present the details that allow the reader to know them. Instead of a character wanting something, you must now describe the thing so that the reader wants it.\n\nInstead of saying: \u201cAdam knew Gwen liked him.\u201d You\u2019ll have to say: \u201cBetween classes, Gwen had always leaned on his locker when he\u2019d go to open it. She\u2019d roll her eyes and shove off with one foot, leaving a black-heel mark on the painted metal, but she also left the smell of her perfume. The combination lock would still be warm from her butt. And the next break, Gwen would be leaned there, again.\u201d\n\nIn short, no more short-cuts. Only specific sensory detail: action, smell, taste, sound, and feeling.\n\nTypically, writers use these \u201cthought\u201d verbs at the beginning of a paragraph (In this form, you can call them \u201cThesis Statements\u201d and I\u2019ll rail against those, later). In a way, they state the intention of the paragraph. And what follows, illustrates them.\n\nFor example:\n\n\u201cBrenda knew she\u2019d never make the deadline. Traffic was backed up from the bridge, past the first eight or nine exits. Her cell phone battery was dead. At home, the dogs would need to go out, or there would be a mess to clean up. Plus, she\u2019d promised to water the plants for her neighbor\u2026\u201d\n\nDo you see how the opening \u201cthesis statement\u201d steals the thunder of what follows? Don\u2019t do it.\nIf nothing else, cut the opening sentence and place it after all the others. Better yet, transplant it and change it to: Brenda would never make the deadline.\n\nThinking is abstract. Knowing and believing are intangible. Your story will always be stronger if you just show the physical actions and details of your characters and allow your reader to do the thinking and knowing. And loving and hating.\n\nDon\u2019t tell your reader: \u201cLisa hated Tom.\u201d\n\nInstead, make your case like a lawyer in court, detail by detail.\n\nPresent each piece of evidence. For example:\n\n\u201cDuring roll call, in the breath after the teacher said Tom\u2019s name, in that moment before he could answer, right then, Lisa would whisper-shout \u2018Butt Wipe,\u2019 just as Tom was saying, \u2018Here\u2019.\u201d\n\nOne of the most-common mistakes that beginning writers make is leaving their characters alone. Writing, you may be alone. Reading, your audience may be alone. But your character should spend very, very little time alone. Because a solitary character starts thinking or worrying or wondering.\n\nFor example: Waiting for the bus, Mark started to worry about how long the trip would take\u2026\u201d\n\nA better break-down might be: \u201cThe schedule said the bus would come by at noon, but Mark\u2019s watch said it was already 11:57. You could see all the way down the road, as far as the Mall, and not see a bus. No doubt, the driver was parked at the turn-around, the far end of the line, taking a nap. The driver was kicked back, asleep, and Mark was going to be late. Or worse, the driver was drinking, and he\u2019d pull up drunk and charge Mark seventy-five cents for death in a fiery traffic accident\u2026\u201d\n\nA character alone must lapse into fantasy or memory, but even then you can\u2019t use \u201cthought\u201d verbs or any of their abstract relatives.\n\nOh, and you can just forget about using the verbs Forget and Remember.\n\nNo more transitions such as: \u201cWanda remembered how Nelson used to brush her hair.\u201d\n\nInstead: \u201cBack in their sophomore year, Nelson used to brush her hair with smooth, long strokes of his hand.\u201d\n\nAgain, Un-pack. Don\u2019t take short-cuts.\n\nBetter yet, get your character with another character, fast. Get them together and get the action started. Let their actions and words show their thoughts. You\u2014stay out of their heads.\n\nAnd while you\u2019re avoiding \u201cthought\u201d verbs, be very wary about using the bland verbs \u201cis\u201d and \u201chave.\u201d\n\nFor example:\n\n\u201cAnn\u2019s eyes are blue.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnn has blue eyes.\u201d\n\nVersus:\n\n\u201cAnn coughed and waved one hand past her face, clearing the cigarette smoke from her eyes, blue eyes, before she smiled\u2026\u201d\n\nInstead of bland \u201cis\u201d and \u201chas\u201d statements, try burying your details of what a character has or is, in actions or gestures. At its most basic, this is showing your story instead of telling it.\nAnd forever after, once you\u2019ve learned to Un-pack your characters, you\u2019ll hate the lazy writer who settles for: \u201cJim sat beside the telephone, wondering why Amanda didn\u2019t call.\u201d\n\nPlease. For now, hate me all you want, but don\u2019t use thought verbs. After Christmas, go crazy, but I\u2019d bet money you won\u2019t.

Better yet, transplant it and change it to: Brenda would never make the deadline.\n\nThinking is abstract. Knowing and believing are intangible. Your story will always be stronger if you just show the physical actions and details of your characters and allow your reader to do the thinking and knowing. And loving and hating.\n\nDon\u2019t tell your reader: \u201cLisa hated Tom.\u201d\n\nInstead, make your case like a lawyer in court, detail by detail.\n\nPresent each piece of evidence.

Writing, you may be alone. Reading, your audience may be alone. But your character should spend very, very little time alone. Because a solitary character starts thinking or worrying or wondering.\n\nFor example: Waiting for the bus, Mark started to worry about how long the trip would take\u2026\u201d\n\nA better break-down might be: \u201cThe schedule said the bus would come by at noon, but Mark\u2019s watch said it was already 11:57. You could see all the way down the road, as far as the Mall, and not see a bus. No doubt, the driver was parked at the turn-around, the far end of the line, taking a nap. The driver was kicked back, asleep, and Mark was going to be late. Or worse, the driver was drinking, and he\u2019d pull up drunk and charge Mark seventy-five cents for death in a fiery traffic accident\u2026\u201d\n\nA character alone must lapse into fantasy or memory, but even then you can\u2019t use \u201cthought\u201d verbs or any of their abstract relatives.\n\nOh, and you can just forget about using the verbs Forget and Remember.\n\nNo more transitions such as: \u201cWanda remembered how Nelson used to brush her hair.\u201d\n\nInstead: \u201cBack in their sophomore year, Nelson used to brush her hair with smooth, long strokes of his hand.\u201d\n\nAgain, Un-pack. Don\u2019t take short-cuts.\n\nBetter yet, get your character with another character, fast. Get them together and get the action started. Let their actions and words show their thoughts.

But one of the main themes of the book is that the whole Buendia family is constantly getting into sexually taboo situations; it's the main tragic flaw that they just aren't able to shake out over the repetitive course of the generations.\n\nJose Arcadio and Ursula originally leave to found Macondo because their families worry that their marriage is too close to incest, and their children will be deformed.  Colonel Aureliano as you pointed out falls in love with a nine year old (who dies tragically).  Two sisters at one point fight over the same italian pianist (and all three of their lives get wrecked).  Meme falls for Mauricio Babilonia who is too young and too poor for her family to approve (more tragedy).  Everybody and their brother sleeps with Pilar Ternera, and the eventual feared family incest ends up literally destroying everything.\n\nMarquez doesn't moralize over whether it is okay or not for characters to be in any of the relationships that show up in this book - cousins, abused prostitutes, people just of different social status - but by and large love has harsh consequences for everyone in the story, and much of the time it is because they are transgressing social norms.\n\nAll that said, yeah the dude falling for a nine year old is gross.
