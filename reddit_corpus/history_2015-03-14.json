Francis Xavier outlines some of them in his correspondence to the Society of Jesus that one of the problems was that the Japanese couldn't comprehend the notion that their ancestors were condemned to hell for not believing in a god they had never heard of until missionaries appeared on their shores.\n\nThe missionaries themselves also tried getting too involved in politics. Converting daimyos to Christianity caused conflict because instead of those Christian daimyos providing funds to the Shogunate they were instead providing it to missionary activities. They also helped with some of Nobunaga's suppression of Buddhism.\n\nEventually the missionaries were viewed as a threat to the internal security of Japan, especially after the colonization of the Philippines. Plus, it didn't help that the  *San Felipe* Incident happened in which the captain (or missionaries) threatened Japan that missionaries were just the first step towards Spanish conquest.\n\nThe Japanese Christians were increasingly persecuted and rewards were given for informing on them, and even greater rewards for informing on a \"padre\". What sealed it was the Shimabara rebellion, a rebellion that had a basis in the horrible taxes the peasants were enduring and it quickly changed into a Christian rebellion. It was violently put down (with the help of the Dutch since they didn't proselytize) and that pretty much ended public displays of Christianity...and the sakoku period made it certain that future missionaries wouldn't arrive. At least not until Perry forced Japan to open her borders.\n\nThere are a hell of a lot more details and circumstances surrounding it, but those are a few notable ones.\n\nEDIT: Remembered the name of the ship.

We get the email, run some searches through our internal database, pull relevant material, set it up in a room for researcher to see, or, if possible, send scanned copies through email.\n\nNow, we can't just let anyone make these requests because; 1) People would likely just make completely idiotic and time-wasting requests, and 2) Much of these materials are fragile and old. If you want to see them, you should have a good reason for us to move them. \n\nIt can also take the registrar or whoever else is pulling things for you a while to find it. Most museums were not founded in the digital age, and they didn't keep themselves to the professional standard that is becoming more the norm. Records are incomplete, inaccurate, or sometimes objects are even found to be missing. Much of my time at the museum was spent updating records and correcting past mistakes. I'd imagine the Vatican archives are quite old and large.\n\nMost museums and other institutions that maintain archives require you to be doing some sort of research before making a request.

When you've been collecting stuff for nearly 1000 years, and don't bother to actually do much cataloging for the first 900, you lose a bunch of shit.

Also things like ABMs and other missile shield technologies (despite being unlikely to be useful against superpowers) are seen as reducing the effectiveness of MAD as a policy. \n\nRussia, for example, backed off their no first use policy in the '90s and stated that they reserve the right for a nuclear response to conventional war. Much as NATO maintains the right to preemptive first strike.\n\nFirst strike tactics attempt to get around MAD by disabling enough of the opponents nukes to be able to survive their strike. This is pretty unrealistic nowadays, as the majority of nukes are on submarines or mobile (in the case of Russia). If you don't know where the nukes are, you can't really disable them.
