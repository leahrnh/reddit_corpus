Maybe their parents have slowly left the strictness of Islam and they're just taking it to the extreme. Maybe these are just those few crazy people that are statistically inevitable. I've met a lot of Muslim people who struggled with growing up in a western society with Islamic morals. If they did pick anything up from their parents it'd be that. So they're close to god, they take their rules seriously. Yet they're surrounded by peers who drink and do what we see as normal teen shit, but its not normal for them. They could be struggling with some internal battle between what they think is right, what they're influenced to do, and what they want to do. They're wondering what right and wrong is, they feel a certain pressure to not exclude themselves from their peers just like everyone feels but they might have very strict religious parents. Not that any of these issues are a reason to join ISIS but there are those people out there who do all sorts of things you might never even consider. I just think this internal battle and feeling that they don't fit might drive them to a fringe group and be apart of what actually leads to this. No young Muslims I know have ever talked about being influenced like this but I've heard a lot about feeling out of place and confused during high school.

At best without direct western military action the only thing western military aid will accomplish is to prolong the conflict but it will not change it's eventual defeat.\n\nIf we are not willing to send troops in to Ukraine and kill a lot more than 'some Russians' and bring the world to only hair width away from WWIII than only rational thing to do is bring this conflict to an end.

That was the point of Islam and the last prophet...there would be no more alterations in the text and you wouldn't have what happened to the Torah and bible. The purpose was that anyone seeking the truth would be able to turn to the quran for guidance and not be confused over old testament versus new testament versus king james and on and on. Now what WILL change is the interpretation of the text, and there lies the key. My assertion that it is not Islam the religion that is lacking, but the culture and traditions of those who practice it. Before islam women were severely more oppressed in the arab world (buying the girls alive at birth and whatnot) and the notion of giving them any rights was revolutionary and controversial. In Muhammad's time, women were arguably more free than in today's societies (for example there was no segregation during prayers, no coercive laws for covering).

The Old Testament provides the history of the tribes of Judah, the history of creation, and the original Levitical laws. During the period in which it was written, people were under the law and had a purely legal relationship with God where you had to fulfil specific laws in order to make yourself right with God, and when you violated those laws, you burnt a sacrifice to atone for your sins.\n\nIn the New Testament, Jesus became the fulfilment of the law. We are no longer bound by laws such as eating certain foods, circumcision, etc because our relationship with God has changed. While we are still required to avoid sin (such as blasphemy, coveting, etc) our path to salvation is by accepting the sacrifice provided by Jesus, which takes the place of the regular sacrifices made before Jesus came.\n\nThe Bible hasn't been deliberately altered over time, that simply isn't true. When you talk about specific interpretations of the original Hebrew/Aramaic/Greek texts such as the King James Bible, of course those are fallible - just as an English interpretation of the Qur'an is never as accurate as the original Arabic text, and isn't considered authoritative or as valid as the original text.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13", "qSentId": 35149, "question": "Well your exactly right, the religion will never change.

You can't impeach someone because politics, that would be chaos.\n\nThe following was taken directly from that law:\n\n*PARTE SEGUNDA*\n\n*PROCESSO E JULGAMENTO*\n\n*T\u00cdTULO \u00daNICO*\n\n*DO PRESIDENTE DA REP\u00daBLICA E MINISTROS DE ESTADO*\n\n*CAP\u00cdTULO I*\n\n*DA DEN\u00daNCIA*\n\n*Art. 14. \u00c9 permitido a qualquer cidad\u00e3o denunciar o Presidente da Rep\u00fablica ou Ministro de Estado, por crime de responsabilidade, perante a C\u00e2mara dos Deputados.*\n\n*Art. 15. A den\u00fancia s\u00f3 poder\u00e1 ser recebida enquanto o denunciado n\u00e3o tiver, por qualquer motivo, deixado definitivamente o cargo.*\n\n*Art. 16. A den\u00fancia assinada pelo denunciante e com a firma reconhecida, deve ser acompanhada dos documentos que a comprovem, ou da declara\u00e7\u00e3o de impossibilidade de apresent\u00e1-los, com a indica\u00e7\u00e3o do local onde possam ser encontrados, nos crimes de que haja prova testemunhal, a den\u00fancia dever\u00e1 conter o rol das testemunhas, em n\u00famero de cinco no m\u00ednimo.*\n\n*Art. 17. No processo de crime de responsabilidade, servir\u00e1 de escriv\u00e3o um funcion\u00e1rio da Secretaria da C\u00e2mara dos Deputados, ou do Senado, conforme se achar o mesmo em uma ou outra casa do Congresso Nacional.*\n\n*Art. 18. As testemunhas arroladas no processo dever\u00e3o comparecer para prestar o seu depoimento, e a Mesa da C\u00e2mara dos Deputados ou do Senado por ordem de quem ser\u00e3o notificadas, tomar\u00e1 as provid\u00eancias legais que se tornarem necess\u00e1rias legais que se tornarem necess\u00e1rias para compel\u00ed-las a obedi\u00eancia.*\n\nThis is the *only* part of the law relating to start of the process and trial of presidential impeachment. Ergo, there's no other way to do it.\n\n&gt;You don't need a bloody knife and DNA to impeach.\n\nCorrect. You need evidence of involvement in some sort of crime of responsability.\n\n&gt;She is directly involved in the biggest scandal in the history of this country.\n\nThat's the problem here. *We have no evidence of this*. As much as I believe she was involved, we can't do shit unless we have proof.\n\n&gt;Whether she stole a single penny or not, is irrelevant for Impeachment. In fact, if there WAS criminal case against her, impeachment would be OBLIGATORY.\n\nI already explained why you're wrong here.\n\n&gt;The prosecutor general said he could not charge her criminally now, not because of her innocence, but because she has executive privilege and the alleged crime was BEFORE her presidency (when she was head of Petrobr\u00e1s).\n\nThat's because the President can't be tried for something not relating to his/her job while they're in charge. When she's out, she'll be tried, specially considering how much attention this whole scandal has been getting.\n\n\n&gt;BUT, politically, this does NOT exempt her at all. We have a president which served another president, both of which are to their necks in corruption scandals. That is enough cause for impeachment.\n\nPolitically? No. Her government is really, *really* bad. However, she can't be impeached for this. Again, with enough pressure from the people and Congress, she might resign, so if you want her out, aim for that.\n\nEdit: Love how I'm getting downvoted for stating the law.

A non-conspiratory interpretation is that this protest is popular with the middle and upper middle class, and the media is simply fishing for ratings.**)\n\nThis protest was generally organized through social networks, though where I live there were cars with loudspeakers calling people,e to protest two weeks in advance. Amongst the many rules of the protest, one of the bans flags or T-shirts of political parties. I'm not going into the implications of what this means.\n\nThe protests' main focus is the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff. While I personally agree her government has been everything short of a disaster, the Constitution makes it very clear when a President may be the object of an impeachment process. There are strict rules, which do not apply here. \n\nIn a nutshell, a petition for impeachment needs to be filed with evidence that the president has committed a \"crime of responsibility\", during their tenure as president. The Constitution lists the crimes that are impeachable. The petition must be accepted by the Chamber of Deputies (lower house), passed on to the Senate, which gives the final ruling. Both houses need to approve the impeachment by a two-thirds majority.\n\nIn addition to the legal constraints, a number of respected politicians in the opposition have spoken against the impeachment. Ex-president Cardoso has reiterated that it would do little to solve the current crisis. Former candidate Marina Silva stated recently that it would serve to further aggravate the political crisis in a moment that Brazil needs stability and credibility in the international market. The largest proponent of an impeachment is deputy Jair Bolsonaro, who has made himself famous for sexist and homophobic remarks, and his staunch defense of the military dictatorship and of the use of torture in police investigations.\n\nI am a strong believer in democracy. It's still very young in our country (30 years today) and we tend to take certain rights for granted. I fully support the people's right to protest. I agree the current administration had it coming with their foolhardy economic policies of the last four years. What I don't agree, however, is that the constitution be disrespected or worse--as there's also a minority calling for another military coup.\n\nIt should also be mentioned that there is a lot of ignorance here about how presidential succession works. I've heard many people--and educated people at that--claim that if Rousseff is impeached, there will be new elections. This is a misreading of the constitution--if the president is impeached, the vice-president is sworn in immediately. Only if both the presidency and the vice-presidency are vacant is Congress authorized to call new elections--direct elections if there are more than two years left of the mandate, and indirect elections if in the second half.\n\nThe fact that this kind of misreading spreads like wildfire even amongst the most educated in our society says a lot about our political culture and about how everyone still has a lot to learn about how the government works and about the importance of democracy.", "aSentId": 37088, "answer": "Aw c'mon playing the media conspiracy card again???\n\nWhen the media was 100% pro Lula and PT, did you complain???\n\nI find it funny how Greek \"socialists\" go to Berlin to ask for loans, then when time comes to pay, OMG they're evil f'n bankers!!!\n\nBrazilian politics is just as low as the Greek \"socialists\" right now.

Instead of fixing any of their problems or living within their means, they're just taking massive loans from China to be repaid in cut-price oil.

Water supply is a **state** issue: federal government gives the money, the state decides what to do with it, so people who blame the president for it are grossly mistaken;\n\n* Approval rating is highly related to how expensive the dollar is and, like in the US, to how expensive gasoline is.

There is a clear exemption for that sort of activity, although how the determination of what will define those actions seems unclear to me. What bothers me a lot more (and what nobody seems to be talking about too much) is in part 2, the Secure Air Travel Act, specifically: under Appeals, 16.(6)(e). The provisions apply to appeals and allow for the following:\n  \n(e) the judge may receive into evidence anything that, in the judge\u2019s opinion, is reliable and appropriate, even if it is inadmissible in a court of law, and may base a decision on that evidence  \n  \nThis is not acceptable. \"Inadmissible in a court of law\" should mean just that. I'm really troubled by what this might allow for. Worst case scenario would be \"We cut this guy's fingers off and he totally admitted to being a terrorist\". It doesn't have to be torture. There could be coercion, deception, all manner of debatable things. The RCMP already practise Mr. Big stings frequently, and those get a lot of criticism and attention in the courts. Whatever might qualify for 'otherwise inadmissible but OK because terrorists' is frankly a mystery to me, which is a problem. It's complicated further by (f):\n  \n(f) the judge may base a decision on information or other evidence even if a summary of that information or other evidence has not been provided to the appellant\n  \nSo not only can the judge's refusal of an appeal (in the event you are denied transportation under section 9) be based on inadmissible evidence, but an appellant need not be entitled to know what that inadmissible evidence is. I can understand somewhat if, as in the recent VIA rail plot trial, certain evidence may compromise undercover agents and even endanger their lives. But that is provided for in (6)(b).

Yes, wage inequality is a problem, but it's obvious why.  Connections are more important than education.  Almost everyone who has a great job got it by knowing people, there may be education requirements but by and large knowing who to talk to and what to do from people who are in whatever business is how you get the good jobs in that business.  It's not surprising given that thats the case that a minority group would have a harder time finding those jobs.  Cultural differences and potential barriers caused by recent immigration status means they're less likely to have those connections needed to advance themselves.  It's a shame, its cronyism which we generally agree is a problem, but it's pretty much a fact of life.  Your complaint about managerial positions seems even more flawed, upper management in most companies is made up of people who have worked for the company for 30+ years if not inhereted.  It's not surprising that asians aren't taking a lot of those jobs, discrimination was alive and well in the past when most of those managers got their foot in the door, not to mention how many asian americans are recent immigrants.\n\nObviously I am talking about asian americans in America, which are predominantly japanese, chinese, vietnamese, korean, and thai (excuse me if i forgot someone).  Yes I realize asians make up a huge percentage of the population, but let's be honest, very few americans are going to recognize mongolian traits.  The only reason I think of mongolians as \"masculine\" is because the only thing we ever learn about them is Genghas Khan, and that has nothing to do with how they look.  One of the things I find so frustrating about dealing with racism is that so many people get caught up in this idea that all generalization is bad.  Generalization is in large part how humans think, and as long as you recognize there are exceptions there's nothing wrong with that.

They generally live comfortable lives (bottom of the pyramid of needs is generally well taken care of: security, food, shelter, etc.), but have little to no intellectual freedom. When tragedies of any sort happen, this sentiment is only heightened and young people's motivations are quickly dismissed as irrelevant.\n\nThere may be something coherent in this. Young people simply lack the frontal lobe development required to be wise and this clashes with the eternal struggle of the forbidden. Restrict something primal and it only wants to go out stronger. Drug prohibition leads to higher and riskier outcomes, yet societies with stricter drug laws usually see higher usage rates. Abstinence education is ridiculous beyond reason. Dude is a rebel/terrorist with a motorcycle/AK-47 that my parents hate, that will show them.\n\nThese past decades, our societies have been dumping more responsibility on young people (more expectations anyway), but attitudes have gone backwards in that they are infantilized more than ever. More responsibility with less power, a bad combination. You get all the blame and none of the rewards.\n\nWith an aging population, this is likely going to be an increasing problem. It's much easier to marginalize 10% of the population than 30% and the needs of both ends of the age spectrum are literally mutually exclusive (medical care now vs. education and continued prosperity for decades, a far away war is good for my security vs. I'd rather not go to war pretty please).\n\nOne big aspect is missing from this debate: the freaking mirror. No one commented just how badly we have to be failing (on this aspect anyway) as a society to even witness a single free(er) western-born privileged (relatively to the rest of the world) kid go to a war zone rather than staying home. There is absolutely no introspection about the context of the situation, it's all focused on the big bad terrorists (they are shitty people who can be safely ignored as their influence is minuscule).\n\nWe're putting young people in a situation where all that is needed is a tiny bit of wisdom to be able to immensely appreciate the world around them. But they don't have it, and we're mad at them for not acting the way they simply aren't wired to. We can attack the situation up front and make things worse, or get serious about the gigantic changes that have happened to our societies and completely changed the context of youth, from low survival rate in a harsh unforgiving environment to a nurturing but shallow and pedantic one.\n\n", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13", "qSentId": 40206, "question": "When people are so disillusioned and so unable to think of themselves, this is what happens.", "aSentId": 40209, "answer": "I think you guys are both wrong.

It's sickening that some people can abuse some people's beliefs this far for personal gain. \n\nHonestly I blame the government and media for the fear spreading across this country and the shameful political practices the Conservative party is using for the next Canadian federal election. \n\n\"Vote conservative or you side with the terrorists!\"\n\nMy country has changed so much in the past 10 years that I barely recognize it from the way it was back then. Giving the police more power isn't going to prevent terrorism here because it isn't a problem here. The people who terrorism is a problem for are the people in the Middle East. I watched a video a few months ago where a Mosque was attacked and that was frightening. Our last \"terrorist\" attacks were done by two men who were unrelated to each other and were both mentally unstable where one killed two RCMP officers in a hit and run accident and the only thing the military officer had to defend himself against a gun was bayonet where he was shot in the back. More people are killed here by drunk driving accidents and the government is saying terrorism is a huge problem here?

Even though he was billions in debt, he was still buying more media outlets until Goldman Sachs foreclosed on Canwest and took over his monopoly.\n\nLong story short, the new owners are a bunch of financial institutions and investment companies from the US and Canada. They're trying to buy out their competition now and if the deal goes through, they'll own all major newspapers across Canada.\n\nWith this whole ISIS thing, they're pretty supportive of our current government who is trying to scare Canadians into supporting more militarization via terrorist fear-mongering.\n\nThis stuff is all basically propaganda.\n\nActually, this is mostly advertising and propaganda. The 'documentary' they're talking about is on Global which was owned by Canwest but sold to Shawmedia when Postmedia was created a few years ago.

The United States has twice poured out its blood and treasure, almost too late, to stop evil regimes hell-bent on taking over the world and massacring whole segments of the world's population.  Even then, and in part because we were late, the butcher's bill was staggering.  We think people ought to, and can, govern themselves.  We do not want to run the world, and would much rather have people run their own countries.\n\nSo, we chose to limit our activities after the second World War as much as possible.  Unfortunately, other countries had, and still have, the desire to conquer the rest of the world by force of arms, and so there has been the Cold War, which we did the least we could get away with to keep those murderous regimes in check.\n\nNow, we have not only murderous countries to contend with, but also a fake religion seeking to conquer the world.\n\nDo you want to see a force for evil?  Look at the results.  Look at Russia and Iran, two countries intent on conquering their neighbors.  Look at China, and its oppression of its own people.  Look at anywhere that Islam measures more than 10% of the local population, and see the violence.\n\nDo you want to see a force for good?  Look at Europe.  Look at Japan.

", "aSentId": 41348, "answer": "&gt; ritual abuse of children could be widespread and accepted by any number of people. \n\nWhy? It happens in the third world all the time. Look at the child sex market in Thailand. Now look at who the primary consumers of the international child sex trade are (men from the US, but I'd wager to say that the UK isn't too far behind). These are all facts (the fact that international child sex trafficking exists and that Americans are large consumers of said market).\n\nBut even if Americans weren't the largest consumer of international child prostitutes, hypothetically speaking, there still is a market. There is a very large, very expensive market for the child sex trade. There obviously has to be a demand. Meaning that large amounts of people are turning a blind eye to it. I mean, in the case of third world countries and the international market their own cops don't give a shit, but neither do ours, as we have only convicted a handful of child sex tourists over the last decade. \n\nSo yes, to answer your question, there is a case of child abuse on a large scale that is widespread and accepted by a lot of people.\n\nAs for close to home? Just look at the Rotherham scandal. Many victims. Many perps. Many victims were even prostituted, which means many people were buying young girls. The police handled it very poorly and even covered it up. I think if it did not gain international attention it would have gone no where. I had to follow it through for years before I saw it budge even a little bit, and while that was happening, even more child grooming was being done. And again, someone has to be supplying a demand in order for there to be a market. \n\n(Also, don't forget that in America the average age of entry into prostitution is very, very, very young - 13 for girls, 12 for boys. This was a well established fact up until a couple of years ago. Of course, over recent years these statistics have been debated and debased by \"sex worker organizations\" like SWOP, which are disingenuous at best and often run by the pimps themselves who are motivated to erase evidence of child prostitution.\n\n12-13 may not seem like very young to you if you are the kind of person that imagines that these acts are being perpetrated against babies, but 12-13 is generally the age we are talking about when we are talking about what is said in OP or what was done in Rotherham. If you read about the Dutroux case in Belgium, you will find that the victims were considered in their \"prime\" around 12-13 and past their prime at 16. I'm just adding this statement because I've actually had to argue here on reddit that 12-13 is young, lol.)", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13", "qSentId": 41347, "question": "Stories like this of course sicken me, but maybe I have too much faith in human beings, because I find it hard to believe that something like the ritual abuse of children could be widespread and accepted by any number of people.

A mobile network that owns its own infrastructure doesn't need to buy in MBs to sell them, much of the cost is in fact the building and maintaining of the infrastructure, and the licencing of the spectrum from the government. If the mobile internet provider has a lot of spare bandwidth, a deal like this to sell the excess to an as yet untapped market could reduce the fees, because most of the costs are fixed, and such a limited service is unlikely to cannibalise their current customers.\n\nThe implementation of this idea could be good, bad, or a mix.
