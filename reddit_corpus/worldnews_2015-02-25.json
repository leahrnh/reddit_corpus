THE most secret part of any intelligence operation are sources and methods. You never, ever release raw data if you can. Or show it. Or actually even hint what kind of raw data you have, how you obtained it and so on...\n\nAs for why? If you know what your opponent is capable of, you can devise countermeasures. Proper camouflage for example, or timing your activities accordingly. Satellites move on known orbits. For visual reconnaissance satellites the most appropriate orbit is relatively low polar one. Low because \"the higher you fly\", the worse resolution you get. Polar orbits however mean there's quite a bit of time when there's nothing flying over area you want to see (that's why U-2, SR-71 and unmanned drones were and are so important - you can put it where you want, WHEN you want, and with little to no warning).  That's the common knowledge at least. \n\nNow, let's assume Russia times it's activities on the ground accordingly, so there's nothing flying overhead. There's no reason to think otherwise - NATO countries will be reluctant to send drones into the area, and even if they do it has to respect Russian airspace or otherwise Lavrov will come screaming bloody murder RF is being invaded. Satellites with known capabilities are, as I said, fairly easy to avoid simply using a schedule.\n\nSo here comes US with a pictures of Russian artillery caught red handed. What's the benefit? Not much - people not convinced so far won't change their mind anyway, since they're either so blind and stupid it doesn't matter what is shown (\"It's photoshopped!\"), or are paid by Kremlin and subsidiaries. However, Russia can pinpoint when the picture was shot (yeah, that's quite easy - you can deduce the. Than they can narrow it down to which bird they mislabeled, for example a geostationary satellite they thought is communication one that in fact provides a mind blowing photo surveillance. The angle photo is made from, length of shadows etc. - it gives a lot info.

Russia is very likely quite nervous about being so close to 'the West', the certainly dont want a NATO/EU/West country against their borders.  Still though, not a defensible reason to invade and annex a foreign country.\n\n&gt;Frankly, if Canada overthrew their government and installed a government that immediately allied with Russia, I'm pretty sure the US would be far less slow with invading and securing the country than the Russians have been with Ukraine.\n\nSeriously good point.  But two wrongs don't make a right, and claiming that the US would act similarly still does not provide legitimate reason for Russia to invade and annex land in a foreign country.  \n\nSorry that other commenter couldn't come up with a real response, but i felt your (great) comment deserved a thought out counter argument.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13", "qSentId": 38463, "question": "Everyone getting outraged over Russia annexing Crimea is a bit silly.

Now that he's lost Senate (and House, in his first term) majorities, he's under even more pressure than ever to affix his name to the kind of legacies he wants.  \"Obama's War\" is not one of them.

So, he's perfectly content to keep holding off and paying a bunch of pointless lip service (through Kerry) about the matter, and pray that Putin doesn't dramatically escalate anything in the next two years.\n\nThe EU is even more reluctant than Obama to do anything.  For them, it's less about politics and more about economics.  The EU has been wrestling with a very fragile economy for several years.  A war - even a limited one - would disrupt that very much.  A war - even a limited one - with Russia would totally ruin the EU economy.  So, they're basically tap-dancing around Putin's actions in Ukraine too. \n\nPutin, on the other hand, is well aware of both of these issues.  He's (so far) been smart enough not to escalate to the point to force Obama's hand, but still make real progress on his appropriation of Ukraine.  He also knows the EU would find a trade war highly undesirable - hence, the mostly toothless sanctions offered by the West. \n\nPutin simply recognizes the opportunity provided by political paralysis and economic struggles, and is betting that he can accomplish his objectives in Ukraine before:  (1) the US attains the political will; and/or (2) the EU economy recovers to the point that real economic sanctions won't have repercussive effects.  \n\nOf course, no one knows the mind of Putin but Putin.  But, I'm betting he's no more interested in a major land war, much less a nuclear-laced one, with anybody.  A nuclear confrontation would be self-destructive, and a conventional war might expose some suspected weaknesses of the current Russian military.  \n\nBut, he's probably a cynical pragmatist, and sees an opportunity to advance Russian influence at the expense of Ukrainians, costing him nothing more than the bizarre kabuki theater of international relations.  \n\nCan't stand the man.

It makes him a pragmatist.  And I believe it was his very concern over former Eastern Bloc countries \"going NATO\" that at least in part motivated Russia's activity in Ukraine.  If anything, his actions in Ukraine are implying a warning to other former Eastern Bloc nations from attempting to do the same. So, I don't think it's necessarily a \"win\" for NATO.\n\nAs the situation stands now, it is quite clearly a \"win\" for the Kremlin, since they're the only party in this fiasco who is getting what they want (save perhaps the Russian nationalists fighting alongside Russian troops and armor).  \n\nBut who's \"winning\" isn't important.

Were they supposed to bring it up again?\n\nWould we have taken the time and possibly lose the element of surprise...\nOr would we just take what we needed, hope for the best, and deal with the backlash as it comes?\n\nAgain - Putin is a dick, but kissingers and the former Reagan ambassador to Soviet Union (forget his name) agree - this was a pretty obvious sequence of events.\n\nWe can't expect a world power to lay on it's back when a neighboring territory has a political collapse and potentially effects what they consider to be a vital resource.. Shit is going to go down in that scenario no matter which world power is involved.\n\nI think we have to keep it atleast that honest to move the discussion of Crimea and Russia forward \n\nI do want to mention - I am not against the\nWests response and continuing to respond to this, but we must educate\nOurselves to better understand how to avoid these situations and potentially how to solve this one..\nThe scariest thing this can turn into is Russia viewing us as actively opposing them militarily.. Then no longer is it a potential misunderstanding and could turn into self into a larger conflict.. So I believe in the sanctions\nAnd other means but I certainly do not support military aid for this conflict.\n\nThe moment it turns into \"the west is actively trying to block us from a strategic necessity\" this shit will get a lot worse really fast..\nAlthough we may already be toeing this line", "aSentId": 42025, "answer": "I think what pisses people off more is Russia denying all of that, and saying that they are not involved.

All the countries that spend less have very obvious problems with their militaries. E.g. the UK and France (both of who spend ~2% of GDP on defence, the highest in NATO apart from the US) running out of bombs when they intervened in Libya, the UK having to use US aircraft to hunt Russian subs, the lack of armour in Europe to deter Putin and so on. \n\nAlso given that Russia and China are highly secretive places isn't it better to over provision than under provision? Especially as over provisioning deters them from even trying to compete with the US and ideally from attacking US allies. All of whom tend to nickel and dime their defences because they don't know how to think strategically. \n\nNow you may say \"Well fuck those guys. If we cut our defence spending they'll have to stop free riding\". I sympathize with that but in practice if the US cuts defence spending the people lobbying to cut defence spending will use that to say \"Look, even the US is doing it. We'd be mad to keep spending absolutely obscene amounts on defence. We wouldn't start a war over silly 19th Century notions like territorial expansion and therefore neither would Putin\". The problem is Putin very obviously is prepared to start wars for territorial expansion.\n\nSpending 4% on defence to stop WWIII seems expensive but look what WWI and WWII cost the US to fight. The US even tried to stay out of both for as long as it could before eventually getting dragged in. \n\nIn an ideal world liberal democracies would share out the spending more equally. Hell in an ideal would everywhere would be a liberal democracy and you wouldn't have people like Putin trying to do 19th Century power politics with 21st Century equipment.

Another example is that he \"created\" a fleet of mosquito missile craft by fitting P-15 Styx missiles onto Boston Whalers and then using them over a hundred miles from the coast (he wasn't even transiting them from coastal harbors and anchorages - he just positioned them in an ideal spot and stated they were opening fire).\n\n&gt; * The ships Van Riper claimed to use aren't sea worthy, and its quite possible that they may not have even made it out of the harbor with the amount of extra weight placed on them.And even if he did, launching those missiles would be the last thing those boats ever did.\n\n&gt; Van Riper should have been charged for the shit show he caused and the amount of money he wasted acting like a child during the simulation.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13", "qSentId": 42872, "question": "Military drills like this are meant to send the message that \"we can defend ourselves in the case of an attack\".

However, one should note that the Chinese and others have been quietly developing missiles *specifically* designed to take out heavily-protected aircraft carriers for over a decade now.\n\nWhat you want to look closely at is the Millennium Challenge 2002 wargames.\n\nThe US military decided it wanted to stage a war game against a fictional country very much like Iran, smallish, but with modern, mid-to-hi-level technology. Well, the guy they put in charge of the \"enemy\" troops realized in about half a second that if he relied on the tech weapons and resources he had, the US would kick his ass in about 2 minutes.\n\nSo he tossed all that out. Instead of using hi-tech radio gear (which can be intercepted and/or jammed), he sent messages via guys on motorcycles. He shut of his radars. He used small fishing boats loaded with explosives instead of capital warships. That kinda thing.\n\nAnd he mopped the floor with the Awesome US Freedom Machine. He sank dozens of capital warships, including an aircraft carrier, all resulting in the simulated deaths of some 20,000 US troops.\n\nSo the military did the only logical thing it could at that point: stopped the games, refloated the ships, reset the simulation, and ordered the commander to play by \"our\" rules. When he did that--under protest--the games resulted in the \"correct\" outcome: another Glorious Victory for our side. Hurrah!\n\nLike a lot of other stuff we pay wayyy to much for, America pays more and gets less for out military dollar than any other industrial country, and we're getting spectacularly bad value for our money. \n\nOne of the big problems here is that the military never really got that whole \"sneaky commies declare peace\" memo, and they continue to spend, arm, and train for a full-out war with the Soviet Union (hey, who knows? Maybe Putin will eventually grant their wish). Meanwhile, the people who *actually do* wish us harm are getting smaller, more mobile, and less reliant on technology.

Chinese ICBM warheads are believed to have about a 200 meter CEP, which is why you'd want nuclear warheads for a task like that (the downside being that you'd start a nuclear war, of course). If you dumped a shitload of non-nuke ICBMs on an aircraft carrier, you might get lucky.\n\nBut the Chinese (at least) are thought to be working on supersonic anti-ship missiles that will zip right past any anti-missile defenses. The Russians already have one that cruises along for long distances at low speed like a cruise missile, then shifts to supersonic at the last minute.\n\nBut in any case, I think the fat, lazy attitude that our mighty aircraft carriers and grotesque spending levels make us invulnerable is gonna get embarrassingly blown to bits someday.\n", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13", "qSentId": 43066, "question": "Does anybody have any idea as to *why on Earth* they might want to do that?

(2 Chronicles 15:12-13 NAB)\n\n    Suppose you hear in one of the towns the LORD your God is giving you that some worthless rabble among you have led their fellow citizens astray by encouraging them to worship foreign gods.  In such cases, you must examine the facts carefully.  If you find it is true and can prove that such a detestable act has occurred among you, you must attack that town and completely destroy all its inhabitants, as well as all the livestock.  Then you must pile all the plunder in the middle of the street and burn it.  Put the entire town to the torch as a burnt offering to the LORD your God.  That town must remain a ruin forever; it may never be rebuilt.  Keep none of the plunder that has been set apart for destruction.  Then the LORD will turn from his fierce anger and be merciful to you.  He will have compassion on you and make you a great nation, just as he solemnly promised your ancestors.  \"The LORD your God will be merciful only if you obey him and keep all the commands I am giving you today, doing what is pleasing to him.\"  (Deuteronomy 13:13-19 NLT)\n\n Anyone arrogant enough to reject the verdict of the judge or of the priest who represents the LORD your God must be put to death.  Such evil must be purged from Israel.  (Deuteronomy 17:12 NLT)\n\n If a man still prophesies, his parents, father and mother, shall say to him, \"You shall not live, because you have spoken a lie in the name of the Lord.\"  When he prophesies, his parents, father and mother, shall thrust him through.  (Zechariah 13:3 NAB)\n\nAnd there are many more like killing rape victims for not being rescued and children for not obeying authority.

The second factor was the rebellion in Syria (this may have been what you were thinking of) where the rebels were able to initially push Assad's forces back.

If Ukraine (30 million pop) falls to Russia (whose's relation with the west has been deteriorating) then Russia would be perceived as an incredibly massive threat to all of Europe. Plus Ukraine is very pro EU and also pro Russian. IF you look at a few maps, you will realise just how divided Ukraine is. It's pretty darn serious. Pro Russians are mostly in Eastern and Southern Ukraine (especially Crimea) and the pro EU people are all in Western and Central Ukraine. But are also increasingly growing in other areas that are especially pro Russian.\n\nNobody wants Russia to threaten Europe again. It would be cold war II and everybody in Europe hates communism and doesn't want to see something similar to the Soviet Union ever again.

And keep in mind that the US has a GDP total of 16 trillion. \n\nEconomically, Russia would fall into a pit. And Russia is heavily reliant on European imports and spends tons of money on European (and western) goods. The only reason why Russia is at least somewhat stable (economically speaking) is because it is selling shit tons of oil to the west. And the sanctions (of course) have essentially crippled Russia. No more money from oil, collapse of oil prices, no more western imports, meaning massive hyper-inflation and ridiculous/sudden demand of goods with little supply. And now Russian are being forced to be more conservative on buying stuff. Which has meant massive job losses and shops are gaining less in profits and forced to shut down.\n\nThink about it, America has well over a million soldiers and combined with NATO; Europe would be a goddamned Galactic Empire from Star Wars. \n\nYour description of Russia is too far. Yes Russia and china are pretty powerful. But Russia is a struggling country. The effects of the dissolution of the Soviet Union is still felt today even after 24 years. And Russia's main export is oil and everything else is imported.

The desire for a buffer state between NATO and Russia is also ridiculous since Russia doesn't have the right to tell a neighboring country which organizations it can or cannot join. In short, Russia has no *valid* reason for its military aggression, only its desire that it not border NATO -- which is irrelevant.\n\nAs far as NATO's promises are concerned, I suppose they were just as sincere as Russias signature on the Budapest Memorandum.\n\nAs a final note, you really should visit Russia if you're able.

I watched all those \"a message to the world\" videos and I can't help but think these dudes really need help or a hug or something along those lines. I understand this a very elementary way of analyzing this very brutal situation, however, I just can't help thinking this way. I get sick to my stomach watching this shite and it really tears me up seeing the faces of the young men being slaughtered by other men because a few bullies tell them to. My best friend and business partner is from Aleppo and we discuss this subject everyday. His family is still there. He has minimal contact for obvious reasons and I witness the effect it has on him. He doesn't understand it as much as the rest of us but we always come to the conclusion that these young boys lack family structure and more importantly love. They are promised something that no man can offer. Eternal peace and happiness are found from within, not bestowed upon from an idealistic militant. And just like so many previous historic incidents involving one ideology and the manipulation of the young/naive, it's scary to predict the outcome of the objective. I hate this shit.

The Arab golden age was dawning while the Greeks and Romans were well on their way out. It wouldn't do to just go with Christianity so their own brand of Abrahamic faith was build.   \n\nIt still lend to all the canon of the older books, but the new Quran would be all new and fancy and very importantly, closing lots of loopholes that the older faiths got away with. \n\nThe Quran was whispered in Muhammed's ear by the archangel gabrield. It was the FINAL and LAST word of god (IE ruling out any chance of reformations or reinterpretations) AND it would come with an extra guide on how to read and interpret the Quran (in the form of the Hadiths).   \n\nThis made Islam very useful for the new growing civilization. They went out of their way to solidify it's doctrine in a way that older faiths never really got around to.   \n\nIn turn this also made Islam very inflexible. Christianity's clergy was set up in a way that reformation was still possible. Which allowed for Catholicism to adapt to more modern times. But reforming Islam would mean going directly against it's core tenets. \n\nThat didn't stop the divide between Shiites, Sunnis (and a couple of Suffis), but their disagreement, even though it's quite violent, wasn't as big as say, the protestants and the Catholics.  \n\nSo all in all, we have a very large, robust and cumbersome religion with a very big 'bend or break' attitude. Anyway, I'm banking on the global emancipation of women putting a vice between the moderates and the extremists.  \n\nIt's clear that the vast majority of Muslims simply want a normal life and raise a family like anyone else. They know that their religion carries a lot of stuff that can't be reconciled with the secular humanist societies. So whenever they can, they gloss over those rules as it makes life so much easier.  \n\nHowever, whenever pressed, the social pressure and their upbringing forces them into the identity of 'a true muslim' and they'll have to abide with whatever the Quran says. That's why they hate it when pundits on either side raise these very awkward and sensitive topics.

Forgive and be indulgent (toward them) until Allah give command. Lo! Allah is Able to do all things.\n\nI.e. \"Followers of other Abrahamic religions may try to convert you, but forgive them and let them be unless Allah says otherwise.\"\n\n&gt; (2:256) There is no compulsion in religion.\n\nI.e. \"Believe what you want to believe.\"\n\n&gt; (18:29) Say: (It is) the truth from the Lord of you (all). Then whosoever will, let him believe, and whosoever will, let him disbelieve.\n\nI.e. \"Share the truth of your religion with others, and whether they're convinced or not that's fine.\" (this verse goes on to explain that disbelievers will be punished in the afterlife, but this is to be Allah's work, not the work of his servants)\n\nThen of course there's the entirety of [Surah 109](http://quran.com/109), which basically says that the correct way to live among non-Muslims is to say \"Okay: you believe what you believe and I'll believe what I believe and you worship what you worship and I'll worship what I worship and that's because your religion is for you and my religion is for me.\"\n\n----\n\nOf course, like many holy books the meaning can be twisted even where it's unambiguous (and it's rarely unambiguous). But it's certainly unfair to claim that the Qur'an promotes violent destruction of non-believers any worse than, say, the Bible. What we ultimately see is people who *use* religion to their own violent ends, picking and choosing the bits that suit them: and that's true of most major religions at some point or another.\n\n----\n\nEdit: go read /u/Thuryn's comments below for an even better explanation.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13", "qSentId": 46035, "question": "Can you give some quotes or examples?

In your opinion, what have they gotten so wrong that things have gotten gone badly and there is so much death and barbarism in their society? Have they corrupted the faith somehow? Or have I completely misunderstood you?", "aSentId": 46231, "answer": "Of course , I did read that in your first post. I guess I simply meant to extend your point. The reason I felt the need to say that it was not a reflection of Islam was because everything ISIS does DIRECTLY contradicts what is written in the Quran. For the context of this article, the best example i can give you as to why it is contradictory to the words in the Quran is the very first words that were introduced into the Quran. In Islam it was said that the Prophet Muhammad was meditating in a cave (no knowledge or preaching of Islam at the time), then, it is said that the angel Gabriel appeared to him and the very first words to come from the angel was \"READ\", \"READ IN THE NAME OF YOUR LORD\". The definition of this isn't something that is hard to understand. The definition is clearly to seek knowledge and to learn about the world in the name of God. So it is a duty for Muslims to seek and gain knowledge which is probably a contributing factor to the fact that there was a huge age of discovery and advancements in science following the initial decades of Islam. \n\nTo address the barbaric events that are occurring in Iraq currently I have to say that the American invasion of Iraq left the country in a huge mess. Even though people hate Saddam Hussein (not saying I liked him particularly), he was truly a person who worked for the benefit of his country, and he did not kill people left and right like what is happening now. It is also important to point out that the largest cause for the most deaths in the 21st century in Iraq was due to the war that America waged on Iraq. \n\nLast point to make is from the perspective of the typical Arab. If you ask any Arab who they hate the most in the world currently, they will either respond Isreal (most of the time referring to government), or they will more likely tell you that they hate other Arabs more than anything else. Arabs have a history of dividing themselves, then uniting, then dividing themselves yet again always over trivial reasons, sometimes because of race, (Islam is a universal religion and therefore does not discriminate against any type of people) sometimes because of certain allegiances to groups/tribes/families (not connected due to Islam), and etc. but never really because of Islam itself. If you follow the actions of ISIS you will notice they are largely targeting different races (such as the kurds, or the white race of middle eastern which i cant remember the name), therefore the conflict is due to racism no matter what other people tell you this is not a conflict over religion. And if you also look at the people they kill the most, you will see that more than any other type of people, they kill Sunnis! not christians, nor atheists, nor Shiats, They kill SUNNIS the most, which does not make any sense because of the fact that they're supposedly a Sunni organization.\n\nLast point I want to make is the fact that it doesnt even make sense that they are killing people for not converting. In Islam, it is strongly encouraged to preach to Non-Muslims, however the rule is that you only preach once, and that you should not bother them again. The reasoning is that the person may change their mind and decide to become a Muslim, which would count as a success in the Muslims eyes right? However if you just kill the person on the spot (Not encouraged in Islam at all) they will never have the chance to convert in the future! And that person could have become a Muslim! The parts of the Quran which are popularly quoted here on reddit are either two different things. Either the Quote is taken out of context and the context is the context of war. OR the Quote is discussing what will happen to a non-Muslim should they know about Islam and its teachings and decide to remain a non-Muslim until their death (uninfluenced by a Muslim)\n\nSo yeah, I hope that cleared everything up! I'll be happy to answer any more questions you may have as I have studied the Quran and its teachings pretty thoroughly.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13", "qSentId": 46218, "question": "Iraq was once the cradle of civilization.

Around 1200 AD a man named Genghis Khan grew from abject poverty and exile, into a fierce military leader. He took control of the decent sized Mongol tribes, and then unified all steppe tribes under one giant steppe confederacy. This new confederacy took the name of his own Mongol tribes. \n\nFrom there Genghis Khan conquered vast swathes of China, invaded the scattered Russian kingdoms and waged war on the great middle eastern countries.  He started from nothing, he forged a nation from varied and fractured tribes, and by his death in 1227 he had created one of the biggest and most powerful empires in world history. His successors inherited his empire, and made it into literally the largest land empire the world has ever known stretching all the way from the eastern coast of china, to the eastern most fringes of medieval Europe. The Mongol Empire at it's height controlled more land than Imperial Brittan, more land than the Roman Empire, more land than the Soviet Union. However, within a hundred years succession issues tore the great Mongol Empire apart, although a few of the new empires did manage to survive a long, long time, and leave their mark on history. \n\nGenghis Khan's legacy is dual-fold. On one side, you have a story of rape, and pillage, of burning cities to the ground, of razing great and mighty empires. Tens of millions died by the mandate of Genghis Khan, estimates go as high as 20 million, a number not to be matched again for over 700 years until \"The Great War\", otherwise known as WWI. However, Genghis Khan spread culture, and knowledge, established infrastructure, and within the bounds of the Mongol Empire the world enjoyed an unprecedented amount of religious freedom.\n\nIt's an utterly fantastic and interesting story. Look it up if you want to learn more. If you get really interested, I'd recommend listening to Dan Carlin's \"Wrath of the Khans\" podcast series. I agree, history class can be boring.

Then they planted backdoors and presumably used the compromised computers to spread the infection to other parts of the company network, eventually obtaining access to critical systems which stored the SIM keys.\n\nWhy is a company that is in the business of manufacturing biometric systems not using them for their own employees? How is it that a worker in the security business can log on with a password, when everyone knows that passwords are only as strong as the weakest idiot in the chain? Why aren't they using fingerprint ID?\n\nI'm not saying this would have made a difference -- when the NSA wants to hack you they probably will. They can compromise the employee, not just his password. Their resources are almost unlimited. But it surprises me that information trawled from Facebook or social media can be used to break security at a security company. Every security company should work with the assumption that employees are irresponsible and will pick worthless passwords, click links on the web or in email that they shouldn't click, plug the USB drive they carry on their keychain into work computers to take work home.\n\nSecurity should work **despite** most people not being security conscious. There should be safeguards in place so that if an employee is careless or compromised, his mistake can be caught before it breaks the whole company's security.

All you have to do is construct a scenario where it seems that they may have done something wrong. That being said, what if an agency has the ultimate power of information, and can construct whatever they want by taking things you've said, places you've been, or things you've viewed out of context? \n\nWhat if it was the type of organization that lies to congress about the extent of their program, holds almost no accountability and works in secrets and redaction?\n\nWhat it boils down to is control. Regardless of if you are doing anything wrong, you do not want someone to even potentially have this much control over you. So what we do is encrypt things, censor ourselves over the internet and generally stray away from perceptions that may be politically ambiguous. That is a good start as far as protecting ourselves goes, but what about society? If there is no one left to protest the confinement of innocent people being penalized by trivial laws (war on drugs is a good example as marijuana is in the process of legalization), how can we change society to our benefit. Oppression causes stagnation, and the self-censorship for fear of being drawn out in some out of context display to the masses is a form of oppression.\n\nLaws are made by man and as times change, so should laws. A lot of the time, laws are changed by people directly disobeying them. Homosexuality and use of marijuana are fairly mainstream today due to people standing up against an imperfect (mildly putting it) legal system.
