Zero degrees Fahrenheit is fucking cold and 100 degrees Fahrenheit is fucking hot. Negative Celsius could still be 30 Fahrenheit which isn't that bad depending on wind chill. Obviously for scientific applications Celsius is much better, but Celsius is more of a \"universal\" temperature scale whereas Fahrenheit is more \"human\". It's also useful that a US pint is about a pound meaning that a US gallon is approx. 8 lbs (depending on the liquid's density vs water).","aSentId": 25130,"answer": "But what humans consider cold and hot depends on location and/or season anyway.\n\nHere, in the winter, 32F/0C would be warm, while in the summer that would be cold. 0F/-18C would indeed be quite cold, but if you were further inlands (where the climate is different) you'd need to go deep into negative Fahrenheit anyway before it would be considered \"fucking cold\". There, 0F would just be \"winter\".\n\nAnd the \"fucking hot\" part would start at maybe 30C/86F. Or probably lower. The temperature's never even goes that high, even in the warmest parts of the summer. 100F might as well be the temperature of the sun.\n\nThat 0 to 100F range would then be more like.. -22 to 86F. I'm not sure if that is more helpful than -30 to 30C when it comes to getting a sense of what is fucking cold and fucking hot.\n\nNot actually saying that Celcius is any better for this (and I don't actually have anything against Fahrenheit or its use), but in the end it's just \"lower = colder, higher = hotter\" regardless of what temperature scale you use, and what the exact number means depends on too many variables to just universally stamp it \"cold\" or \"hot\".","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh6e","qSentId": 25121,"question": "That's one thing and I'm pretty sure most soda is sold in litres everywhere.

They're going to smoke and drink anyways, after all.\n\nI get your point, but there surely is a huge difference between sex and drugs. We are programmed genetically to seek out sex.

Eddie hasn't done sketch comedy, stand up, or improv in over 25 years.  I think what he wanted to do was instead of showing up and being Dan Aykroyd (rehashing an old sketch and not really getting that many laughs), that he generally wanted to come back and be gracious about his experience.  But Eddie isn't good at doing that.  I can understand him being like, \"thanks, but I'm not here to be funny, let give all of these other people who put in all this time and effort a chance to get some air time.\"  I don't think Eddie has a big ego, but I think he's no longer willing to take risks like he used to. He likes to do safe movies with safe comedy.  He's no longer on the cutting edge, or risque, and he knows it.  I'm sure parenthood has changed him.  He was 19 when he joined SNL.  Can you think of any videos of stuff you did when you were 19, and think that that defines your career or who you are 35 years later?

You've got most of what I would have said, but:\n\n**My favorite show got a 2.4 last week and a 2.3 this week. Time to analyze the episodes to figure out what caused this disaster.**\n\nIt was probably nothing. There\u2019s some noise in TV ratings from week to week. Things like weather, holidays, big events or repeats in programs on other channels or the same channel, and just happenstance cause minor variations in viewer numbers from week to week.\n\n**Ratings and History**\n\nGenerally, ratings fall with time. The highest-rated shows today have lower ratings than the highest-rated shows from years past, and average-rated shows are the same. As few as ten years ago, a 5.0 rating would put a sitcom in cancellation territory on most networks. Today, it would make that show the highest-rated sitcom on most networks, and something they'd be extremely happy to have. The reason for this is that there\u2019s simply more options for how people watch television, and more options on television, so the rating points are spread thinner.\n\nThis means that you have to be careful when comparing the performance of long-running shows like The Simpsons or Saturday Night Live to their historical performances. Both of these shows get much lower ratings than they used to, but that\u2019s true of their competition as well.\n\n**What\u2019s a lead-in?**\n\nA lead-in is the show that airs right before your show on the same network. Generally when people talk about a show along with its lead-in, they\u2019re talking about two shows where you\u2019d expect the audience from one to carry over to the other in a significant way. Networks can help shows out by giving them a strong, similar lead-in. For example, Modern Family on ABC is a fairly smart but still accessible upper-middle class family comedy. When ABC premiered Black-ish last fall, they gave it Modern Family as a lead-in because it\u2019s similar, and could benefit a lot from having Modern Family as a lead-in.\n\nIn terms of ratings, one thing networks sometimes look at is what portion of a show\u2019s lead-in it\u2019s retaining. The spot after a strong existing show is valuable, and if a new show is losing most of it\u2019s lead-in\u2019s audience, the networks don\u2019t like that. They might cancel it or move it to a less valuable spot.\n\nThere\u2019s no magic formula for determining what percent of a show\u2019s lead-in it needs to keep for that to be \u201cgood\u201d. Higher is better, though.\n\n**I heard that Neilsen found a bug in their software. Does that mean that recent ratings are all wrong?**\n\nIt technically does, but not by a margin that\u2019s worth worrying about as a viewer.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh6e","qSentId": 29547,"question": "I want to do a write up on how network TV ratings work.","aSentId": 29550,"answer": "This is an excellent writeup.
