I see most people bitch about DLC price and all that but you get so much with just the regular game. \n\nFirst off all the 12 maps and 5 modes are free. Same as future maps/modes that will be released. You get 12 hunters and 3 monsters free for getting the regular game. Every hunter has specific lines depending on who is on your team when they banter in the dropship.There is Hunt, Nest, Rescue, Defend, and a mode called Evacuation where you play a mix of 4 modes with balancing for the losing side after every game. Every hunter has 3 unique guns and 1 common class ability and you can unlock progress for each gun that makes it better (2%,5%,10% increases). \n\nThe only DLC right now is cosmetic skins. A monster that they are developing has been teased but is not available yet. I believe the price will  be $20 for monsters and either $15 or $10 for hunters which is not that bad. Having that price allows them to release new modes and maps so I don't mind it.\n\n**Some key points after playing this game extensively:**\n\n1)this game is very fun especially with friends.\n\n2)Needs a microphone for the full experience. Communication as a hunter is key.\n\n3)Several modes at the moment are not well balanced (some favor hunters and others favor monster)\n\n4)Some of the hunters are kind of weak and need quality of life buffs because it is rarely worth choosing them over the others.\n\n5)There is 3 monsters right now Goliath, Kraken, and Wraith. As it is the Wraith is horribly over powered because of a few things in it's kit.\n\n6) Wraith makes it so every game you run around for 10-15 minutes not catching it because it can cover the most ground in the shortest amount of time. You end up fighting Wraith at an objective you defend when it is stage 3 (strongest form). Monster players are spamming wraith hard right now because it's a free win almost, takes great teamwork to beat it.

People don't play them for the gameplay so much as they play them for the characters and the stories. FFXII arguably has the best gameplay, the most well realized world, the best side quests and secrets throughout but there is a gap in terms of relating to the characters who are de-emphasized throughout with less of a clearly defined good vs evil or 'luke skywalker' type to jump in as (which, you know *role playing* game kind of needs that).\n\nBut what you are calling weaknesses I actually think of as strengths. FF6 and 9 for instance are both about super powered individuals trying to destroy the world and a rag-tag group of misfits trying to stop them. That's cool and all and it's immediately relatable and 'easy' in a sense but it's also kind of immature and doesn't have much depth beyond what it is. 12, by contrast, is about the politics of a couple of nations within a greater world, it's about trying to prevent all-out war, dealing with the consequences of occupation and aggression from one nation to another, and what that means for the people(of all races) living in the midst of it, then for good measure they throw in some Atomic Bomb/post-hiroshima metaphors and rumination on the nature of science vs. belief. Most characters are presented with moral ambiguity or singular goals that relate to *them* rather than the 'united in our struggle against...' sort of motivation. Even Vayne, the game's ostensible antagonist, isn't exactly *evil* and his goal of giving mankind the power to challenge gods through science is actually pretty 'fine' as far as goals go. Framed differently and that could just as easily be a protagonist. \n\nThey did fuck up too though and didn't *quite* 'stick the landing' by the end of it. I assume this is because Matsuno left the project midway and they made several last-minute changes to things to bend it back towards a more familiar FF arc(complete with 'one-winged angel' motif in the final battle... snore) but what they set out for and what they built is easily a more ambitious and interesting universe than anything FF had seen prior, one that reels in the binary black and white clarity of 'on a mission to save the world' and instead shows more of a action and consequence in a more realistic sense. \n\n", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh03", "qSentId": 18766, "question": "The reason a lot of Final Fantasy fans rate 12 as one of the lesser quality games in the series is because the main plot barely involves the main characters at all, and the main characters suck except Balthier and Basch.\n\nEvery major story cutscene for the 70 hours of the game I played seemed to take place almost exclusively without the main characters of the game.

Your exact quote above me is that if \"Unless they ate getting into VR then its fucking dumb to compete with PC.\" That's just being a troll.\n\nThat's called being a dickhole about something completely off topic. First off, while VR is awesome and has potential, it isn't for everyone. Plenty of people will still want to play sitting in front of a TV. Second, they don't have to compete with PCs. I would argument that they aren't conpeteing with them. How many games to you see advertised as being on PC being a major thing? Not many. Why? Because the bulk of money coming in to gaming comes through console. I'm not saying they are better or worse, but money wise? There just isn't the same competition.\n\nPCs are great. They have awesome graphics, can be upgrades etc etc. But they aren't for everyone, just like Consoles are great as they are affordable home entertainment units that have a reasonable life span.

The same deal for other models, animations, etc. Much of the work can be crowdsourced to the community. Yes, there still needs to be a very organized small group of people whose focus is to actually implement all of this into the actual finished product, and even more people dedicated to polishing it all up into a cohesive whole, but there's a LOT of talented modders on Nexus &amp; Workshop.\n\nI can see something like this going off the ground in the future. Skyrim is only from 2011, that's only 4 years old. There's still a small active community for the original Neverwinter Nights and that game is already going for 13 years, and was much less popular than Skyrim is. Even if it takes several years in development, i think there will still be an active community for Skyrim to take advantage of the fruits of their labor - just like there's still an active community in Oblivion to take advantage of the Morroblivion project.\n\nWhen they eventually finish the landmass, there'll be dozens of modders jumping at the opportunity to help populate that barren world full of sidequests and unique NPC's. Might take a decade to get there, and it might flop along the way, but if it doesn't, i'm sure that a decade from now there'll still be people that will play that game. \n\nJust remember, they're not doing this for money, they're doing this for themselves, and for fans that are like themselves. This means that they don't care if when they're done the Skyrim community will still be as large as it is today, so long as there's still a community to appreciate it, it'll still be worth it.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh03", "qSentId": 20274, "question": "I run a small film production company.
