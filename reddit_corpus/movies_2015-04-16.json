He might be a hologram, but aside from the fact that he's intangible, he may as well be a real flesh and blood person.\n\nAnd so the entire character of Superman is undone from the ground up.

Kent may have gotten his magnificent abilities from his Kryptonian DNA, but it was the Kents who instilled in him his *most* important qualities - his compassion, his morality, and his *humanity*.\n\nThis film seeks to undo *all* of that. Pa Kent's driving concern is one of *fear*, not morality. And as soon as Clark meets Space-Dad, the Kents almost completely disappear from the film (save for Zod targeting Ma Kent later on) and Jor-El takes center stage... and why not? He might be a hologram, but aside from the fact that he's intangible, he may as well be a real flesh and blood person.\n\nAnd so the entire character of Superman is undone from the ground up.

For the films, that is not same-old, as the clones in Attack of the Clones are an interchangeable faceless mass of generic warriors, and come Revenge of the Sith, they're \"bad guys\".\n\nIn the OT, we were never led to empathize with anyone that has allegiances to the Empire, until Vader has what is clearly a moment of epiphany and his character develops.\n\nWe also don't know what the balance of power is going to be like in this film. With the new republic established, who are going to be the villains? In appearance their are remnants of the Empire, but that might not be the case in the greater scheme of things.\n\nWhat is the scope of the villains' might in comparison to the New Republic?\n\nFrom the visuals in the trailer, it looks to me as we're witnessing the gradual decline of the once mighty Empire - and that's definitely a new take in the Star Wars franchise.

But everything it did show us looked great. What else could you want? Everything I've seen and heard sounds pretty much perfect. If you can't be excited at this point, can you just *never* be excited about a movie? Even if you see a trailer that reveals a lot about the plot, that still doesn't prove it's going to be good.

Reality is, a ton of movies are about a boy and his relationship with the world. Be it his father, his toys, his friends, etc. As a female, I loved the movies growing up.

I think it is important for boys to also see through the eyes of a girl and realize that the world is not just through their experiences. That is it okay to watch a movie about a girl and her mother. Through watching movies focused on the male relationship, I understand the male perspective to a certain extent. It makes me nervous when boys barely see the world through a different lens. It is the unseen privilege of being a male. I am not saying it is bad, but I honestly do wish that more childrens stories had the focus of a female protagonist that was more than just a love story.

", "aSentId": 9311, "answer": "May get my head shot off for this, but Bob is dead, dead right that is. Disney's \"Goiden Age\" may be the 90's, but Pixar isn't Disney, and Disney isn't Disney anymore either. Disney's animated movies may not have had the same critical and commercial reception in the last 15 years or so (though I fucking loved Big Hero 6, and so did most everyone else), but with their purchasing Marvel and Lucasfilm they've claimed the top spot in the movie industry. They may not be releasing animated films to match the classics like The Lion King, Aladdin, or Mulan, but the MCU is the biggest film franchise in the world right now. You've got to consider that Disney isn't just kid's animated musicals anymore when you talk about the company. Sure their recent animated movies may not be as revered as their classics (though personally I fucking love Big Hero 6, thought Tangled and Wreck It Ralph were great, and even enjoyed Frozen), but the animation department is just once branch of a much larger tree now. Honestly I find the quality of recent Disney animated pictures to be rather impressive, especially when you take into account the fact that they're primary focus is on the running of their other major projects right now, namely the MCU and the Star Wars franchise. \n\nPixar is its own studio, and is just one of the many balls that Disney has in the air. Hell even Studio Ghibli falls under the Disney umbrella. What I'm saying is, Pixar animation and Disney animation are not the same thing, Pixar is just one of the many independent divisions of the massive media and entertainement corporation that is Disney. Pixar is owned by Disney, but a Pixar movie is not the same thing as a Disney movie. You can't talk about Disney animated movies and Pixar movies as if they're the same thing. Disney's \"Golden Age\" may be the 90's in terms of the Walt Disney animation studio, but Pixar's \"Golden Age\" didn't even start in the 90's. Toy Story 1 and 2 are good, but a Bug's Life is crap, their worst movie other than the Cars franchise in my opinion. I personally consider Up, The Incredibles, Wall-E, Toy Story 3, and Monster's University to be their best films (which is pretty close to being in line with the general consensus, give or take a bit of personal preference). These weren't even released until the 2000's, starting in 2004 with The Incredibles. If you want to give Pixar a \"Golden Age\" I'd say it's 2003 (Finding Nemo) to 2013 (Monster's University). \n\nBasically what all this means is that the idea of a Golden Age is bullshit. Walt Disney Studio ruled the 1990's, Pixar ruled the 2000's, and the 2010's have been a pretty even mix of the two so far, with Toy Story 3. Tangled, Wreck It Ralph, Monster's University, Frozen, and Big Hero 6 making up a pretty decent line up of solid showings. What  the future will bring is anyone's guess. We could get more flops like Cars and Bolt, hell I'm sure we will, but we could also get more stand alone masterpieces like Up, and great adaptations of other Disney properties, like Big Hero 6. For a comic book nerd like myself, the future's looking pretty bright, with the promise of an Incredibles 2, the likelihood of a Big Hero 6 sequel, and the possibility of more Marvel adaptations and/or Star Wars adaptations in the works. Whatever the future has in store though, it's safe to say that both Walt Disney and Pixar Animation Studios will continue to make movies, Disney will continue to grow, and expand it's increasing portfolio of properties, divisions, and franchises, and rake in cash hand over fist. The way I see it, the \"Golden Age\" of Disney animation may have started with the animated films of Walt Disney in the 90's, but it didn't end their, it's continued to grow and evolve to this day, changing, as all things must, with the times. From The Lion King, to Up, to Big Hero 6, the styles may change, but the quality remains, and Disney continues to set the bar for animation. \n\n/rant\n\n", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3s", "qSentId": 9314, "question": "Um  I'm 23 and I kinda love cars 2 soooo", "aSentId": 9315, "answer": "Well there are exceptions to everything.

Even in the Battle of New York there was little actual dramatic tension because none of the characters were really facing  the type of odds that would allow the audience to really root for them.

Common Knowledge, work on it.\n\n&gt;How do you think they get to the women audience in comic book movies?\n\nWomen do not watch comic book movies to see Hemsworth with his shirt off any more than men go see these movies to see ScarJo's ass. People go see these movies because they find the subject matter interesting. It's not like any Hemsworth movie where he takes his shirt off is going to make shitloads of money just from a female audience. Otherwise Black Hat would've made money. Again, this has nothing to do with OP's claim that ScarJo is EXCESSIVELY sexualized.\n\n", "aSentId": 13272, "answer": "i didnt get past your first 2 lines.

Now, I'm not gonna say she is a bad actress or was cast simply because of her looks because I know that wouldn't be true, She's fine as an actress. \n\nMy issue is your statement that she was cast because of this one aspect of persona. Its a pretty shitty thing to say about someone, and an incorrect assumption that she's only about being a sex symbol. Most of all it didn't even fit the content of the point the person was saying. Your response was just a random voicing of your dislike on this person that had nothing to do with his conversation about the Articles issues with the character. You don't like her as an actress, that is fine. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. However, just because *you* don't like her acting, it doesn't mean she isn't a good actress and most of all Joss Whedon doesn't value her as a part of the cast. I'm sure he wouldn't of cast her if he didn't want her in the movie. She is much better than you give her credit for. I don't know what movies you've seen of hers, however you may not have seen enough to properly judge her as an actress, but its your opinion to have.", "aSentId": 13417, "answer": "It's not really a rare occurrence that actresses are being cast for their sex appeal. It's Hollywood after all. Sorry I am just not a fan of her and her, in my opinion, lack of acting skills and her sexy persona certainly factors into that.

What is so wrong about that?", "aSentId": 13691, "answer": "You are not understanding my points on a fundamental level. You're looking at it specifically and individually which is a useless thing to do when talking about a broad sociological problem like sexism and objectification in the film industry.\n\nFor starters, yes. It would still be sexualization if an unattractive character was showing off sexually when there is no purpose behind it.\n\nI don't see a fault in sexualization if it wasn't so rampant and blatant across the board for women. If you watch a rated R movie and it's rated R for nudity, chances are it's not cuz of all the dick you're gonna see.\n\nI think it's a problem in comic book movies because that's all female characters are. Eye candy. Black Widow I'm VERY up and down on. It just stands out more when she's the *only* woman superhero and is being sexualized, if that makes sense. If there were more female characters who weren't always super sexy sexy, it'd be cool. But right now, there's one planned female superhero movie for Marvel. There's one planned female superhero movie for DC. Part of that is due to there being more male superheroes and I get that. Personally, I think the best movie franchise to tackle male/female equality is the X-Men series (and even they have some shake moments). But you can understand the outrage when Rocket Raccoon gets on the big screen before Wonder Woman does. That's not a numbers thing. That's executives not willing to pull the trigger because god forbid we put a woman in a lead action movie.\n\nIt's just frustrating. Maybe I've grown tired of just seeing tits all the time. I like tits, just... like... I'd rather see a good character than a good pair of tits and that doesn't seem to be priority for big blockbusters when it comes to female characters.\n\nThat's all I gotta say in the matter, really.

Now I'm most likely biased towards DC but they do need something to give them more recognition and this trailer has done just that.\n\nteaser begins with various voiceovers by newscasters debating about whether superman is good or bad for the world, We see gotham(i think so?) as this is going on.\n\nWe see clips of Superman holding &amp; lifting up what looks like a Space shuttle, with a background of flames.\n\nAt this point the camera is going to the focal point of gotham; a Superman statue.\n\nWe see superman land on the ground in some type of underground sewer thing, and see soldiers bowing down before him, a HUGE HUGE CONTRAST between MoS superman in handcuffs by soldiers.\n\nThe camera goes towards the statue lighting up, we hear chanting from various people, and apparently they are chanting** \"GO AWAY!\"** and then the statue is fully light, we see the superman statue spray painted on the S-shield in red:\n\n**FALSE GOD**\n\nWe hear more voiceovers, possibly by Benedict Cumberbach and Neil Degrasse and in particular we hear jessie eisenberg's voiceover as Luthor say this:\n\n***\"Devil's don't come from hell beneath us, no they come from the sky..*** \n\nThat line right there gives us insight of how this universes luthor will be characterized, it shows us that Luthor hates superman and that later on in the trailer, Alfred (I believe so) states this:\n\n***That's how it starts..the fever..the rage..the feigning of powerless men..turns good men..cruel.*** \n\nAt this point of the trailer we're looking at the batsuit and affleck and that line as well as the picture may have well been speaking about batman, BUT what if the he is refering to Lex Luthor?  Batman's role in this film will mainly be about not trusting supes, and on the opposite side of the not-trusting supes spectrum there's Luthor.  It'd be a interesting comparison between bruce and lex, but lets go on.\n\nWe get glimpses of the BvS logo in 3D and get to see the Batwing shoot up some cars, Bruce in the regular Batsuit in a flaming wreckage and standing on a skyscraper, then cut back to similar footage of the comic con teaser with Armoured Bats and Superman in the air and then Bruce goes (and here's the best line of them all):\n\n***Tell me..Do you bleed?..***\nSuperman come down on the ground with massive force (to seem imposing towards bats) then bruce says\n\n***YOU WILL!***\n\nCue BvS logo\n\nSo what does everyone think? I thought the teaser was something different than most superhero movies nowadays and the storyline seems to be a mix of dark knight returns, injustice and their own original things.  I'm really hyped for it and just so crazy about how the world's finest are coming together on screen.

I said it to point out the hypocrisy that a lot of people seem to display. It's like the faceless army point, that shit is present in nearly every major action franchise but people act like it's exclusive to the MCU. It's not. It's everywhere. I can list other franchises at a whim. That was my point, I don't see you saying anything else about other franchises that exhibit the same traits.\n\n&gt;We have two trailers.

It's also why I said **probably** and not **indefinitely**.\n\n&gt;It was pretty average really.\n\nNot really. It was pretty well shot, overall. No unnecessary shaky camera work that a lot of films have, the long jumps to Avenger to Avenger was part of why it was well done. The point of that isn't just purely for style points, it helped with the cohesion of the entire battle and it covered a lot of ground that accurately portrayed a big battle as a big battle instead of cramming the cast into a relatively small area and attempt to deceive the audience into thinking it was a big battle.\n\n&gt;But when we're on the hovercraft, nothing interesting was done with the camera.\n\nIt was competently done. Not everything has to be innovative or try to be interesting with gimmicks. \n\n&gt; The outcome was obvious.

And yes, I do think there's a kernal of truth in this but a lot of action franchises never have any real repercussions. Blockbusters on a whole would never go that route because they're in it for the money, it's not Game of Thrones or The Wire. \n\nIF you want an MCU installment with repercussions you should watch Daredevil. That's MCU going a darker route that the movies will probably never explore unless they want to take a huge risk.\n\n&gt;Okay, that's fine if you have that opinion.\n\nI mean it's not really an opinion. Are you going to say there is any tension in the Lotr films? Fellowship of the Ring did kill off one of the main characters, but not really one that's important or would immidietly cause conflict, in fact if anything it helped solve a problem for Frodo.
