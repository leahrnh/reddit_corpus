Those streets have \"No parking during snow emergency\" signs, and when a snow emergency is declared all cars must be removed from those particular streets for plowing. However: with all this snow, what has happened is those parking lanes have become snow-containment - plows keep shoving snow into this lanes. Snow is not removed, just shoved around. So those parking lanes are just giant thick snow ridges now. (Boston is not set up for routine snow-removal like some of high-snow places. like in Utah, do) Streets have narrowed so much that I now drive with my side mirrors folded in; part of the city was just converted to one-way streets because the streets got narrowed so much by snow dikes on both sides.\n\nThen - virtually all residential streets are NOT snow emergency streets and are fully parked up. In those streets what happens is the street plows still actively push snow into those lanes, so, the snow from the plow sort of wedges around the cars, so that the cars get lined on the street side by a thick high berm of rocky/slushy/salty plow-snow that can be 2' high. So you you have to dig that out too. It's extremely heavy. There is also phenomenon called a \"corner mound\" that forms where plows turn corners; outside my house the corner mound is 3' tall and 15' wide and 2' deep, in a big arc, all created by the plow, and we have to move that ourselves. Also you're not allowed to put the snow back in the street, nor on sidewalks or private property, so people pile the snow into ridges between each 2 cars. The snow ridges have become ludicrously tall and pointy now, like little Himalaya mountains between every 2 cars. Snow ridges on my street are now taller than my head. They're works of art at this point, each one sculpted as high as possible. At this point those ridges can't be piled higher, so most people are having to walk long distances with each shovelful to find a place to put it. It takes literally hours, and the plow-snow, which is chunks of salty ice slush, is really, really heavy. \n\nIt takes literally hours. Last Sun I worked 2 hrs to dig out my car, then another 2 working on the corner mound and 1 hr for the sidewalk, then today I worked on the corner mound some more and the sidewalk. The corner mound is a total obsession of mine now. It regrowd every time the plow comes by. I chip at it off and on whenever I leave the house, and at night I find myself standing at the window and looking at it like a total crazy person.\n\nOh also you're legally required to shovel the sidewalk in front of your house, or you can get a $100 ticket.

A space saver doesn't mean shit here. It's a public place.","aSentId": 13935,"answer": "I think the space saving can be done well.  First off, the space savers are typically for residential spots like apartment parking lots and suburban streets in front of someone's house.  So while it's public technically, it really does make sense to reserve spots where you live.  It's not like people are reserving a spot at the grocery store and one at work.  \n\nHonestly I think there ought to be a system in place where each time it dumps a huge amount of snow (like 6+ inches), they declare it a winter parking reservation day and you get the 48 hour window like Boston does.  Hell, make the law require a clearly written note on your spot marker stating your name, license plate and that it is the law so out-of-towners get it.  Hell, the city could make and sell official road cones with a sign that you fill in and make a profit even, although it should be priced to avoid only the rich affording them.\n\n* It prevents you from having to shovel 5 spots in a week because your job gets PFF later than everyone else's.\n\n* People underestimate how much snow some parts of the country get.  Shoveling a shitload of wet snow meets the criteria to be called backbreaking labor, and there are parts of the country that get snowfall like that on average several times a year..  I'd honestly rather spend my time turning big rocks into smaller rocks with a hammer.  This gets even worse when the plows have doubled it up along the street.  So it's not trivial when it can take literally 2 hours of time to clear out a spot.\n\n* There should be a time limit.  48 hours is pretty good because most people will have used their car by then and dig out a spot, increasing the overall spots available.\n\n* Having a system in place will make things much more civil.  When there are laws, there can be proper followup if someone refuses to comply.  You can have the car towed if it comes to that, but it will prevent vandalism overall because people won't feel powerless and lash out by messing up someone's ride.\n\nI honestly don't understand the whole game theory everyone out for themselves bullshit attitude of a lot of people around here.  It is possible to consider the feelings of others, but for a lot of folks, they basically couldn't give a shit about anyone else.

Parking on main roads is banned before and during storms.\n\nStealing someone else's spot is not an option unless you want to risk having your car damaged.\n\nIt's not even about the \"I spent 4 hours shoveling out this spot,\" (or at this point in Boston, 10+ hours over 4 storms), it's about \"where do I park my car if my spot is taken?\" The answer is often \"miles and miles away\" because there is nowhere else to park.\n\nThe easiest and most rational thing to do (and what everyone in this thread would do if they actually experienced a winter like this in, say, South Boston) is to try and save your spot.","aSentId": 14438,"answer": "Your username infuritates me for some reason ","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l","qSentId": 14421,"question": "I always thought spot save after shoveling was a single (extended) use kind of thing.  You shovel the spot, you get to use it until you leave, unless it is either reserved or on your property.  If you need to run to the store; fine space can be saved.  You need to go for more than 4 hours?  You give it up.","aSentId": 14440,"answer": "(East Boston resident here) They gave us a bunch of pamphlets and the rules are that you can save a space for as long as you want for 48 hours after the snow emergency is over.  South Boston also has the same rules.\n\nHaving lived a year in each place, I moved into the city thinking these space-saver rules were antiquated, dumb, and promoted people being selfish.\n\nBut here's the reality: Unlike every other city I've lived in, Boston places such a high priority on growing the population (through new apartment buildings and businesses), that they overlook parking every single time.\n\nI remember hearing about how some new apartment complexes were going up in my area of Southie, but they didn't want to spend a lot on a garage, so they were allowed to make a garage that wouldn't have enough parking spaces for all the expected tenants.  Which means that the very rare free-parking-without-a-resident-sticker spaces in that area are now permit-only.  And in my area of East Boston, there aren't nearly enough permit spaces on the street, so residents need to park in the visitor spots.  When I park 2 blocks away from my apartment, that's a good day.\n\nI saw it mentioned elsewhere about \"where do you go if someone takes your spot?\"  The answer is, nowhere close to home, or you shovel out a new spot from scratch while you find a temporary area to keep your car (if one can even be found).  I've done a lot of driving in East Boston, and if someone takes your spot, you're screwed.  There is literally no place to go that doesn't cost money.\n\nIt's a cultural thing unique to here and a few other places, and it's 100% the fault of the city of Boston.  Short of building free garages, I don't see what other solution there is outside a huge parking permit price, or stopping all building construction projects.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l","qSentId": 14444,"question": "weak.

And if you do have to go somewhere, that need to be somewhere is the incentive to clean off your car. The guarantee that there will be a spot when you come back doesn't seem like it would make a difference.

Intoxicated drivers: States inability to keep them off the roads\n4. Street violencd: As someone who is near Chicago there seems to the same old ideas floating around to fix the issue at hand.\n5. Potholes - I had to pay out of pocket to fix my tire since the State wouldn't and my insurance wouldn't. Even though it was on their road where my property was damaged.\n\nSometimes you need to light a fire under the State to get it going since no one is competiting with them on the road ways and they're so slow to try to solve the issues at hand. It might lead to having a new infrastructure and new ways to managing the means at hand.","aSentId": 15888,"answer": "First of all, it's \"appalled\".\n\nSecond, your friend didn't die because of poor fucking public planning. Your friend died because of a drunk fucking driver, I HIGHLY doubt putting YOU in charge of building, maintenance, demlition, and policing will change any of that.\n\nA drunk driver doesn't give a fuck if this 5-mile stretch of road belongs to Thurston Fucking Howell III or the state. He's still going to drive on it you wretched retard.\n\nI'll probably get banned for this but SOMEONE had to put you in your place.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l","qSentId": 15897,"question": "Wait, so people work for Uber like a job?

When too many of those judges are on the US Supreme Court, it chips away at our rights and freedoms.\n\nAnother classic example is the *Wickard vs. Filburn* case where the US Supreme Court decided that Congress could force a farmer to burn his crops because he was growing too much wheat for his own personal consumption, based on the Commerce Clause (article I, Section 8, Clause 3 of the Constitution), that allows Congress to regulate Interstate Commerce.  The theory being that his growing more wheat meant he didn't have to buy wheat, which meant that wheat imports or exports from his state would be indirectly affected.  That is obviously not what was intended by the framers - but the US Supreme Court agreed with that argument by government lawyers, which is why the Federal Government can use the Commerce Clause to regulate every aspect of our lives (except in those few cases where the Supreme Court has determined it doesn't apply).","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l","qSentId": 16068,"question": "&gt; All laws build on the constitution.

","aSentId": 16132,"answer": "This is not what's going on or what Kaspersky is talking about.\n\nKaspersky is talking about the discovery of a malware platform developed by an entity that is like the NSA, which compromises a computer remotely, via a variety of vectors including websites, tainted cd-roms, and infected USB-keys.\n\nThe platform in essence becomes the operating system, injecting itself into Windows in real time, which basically runs on top of the malware as a virtual machine. This allows the malware to do very basic level programming tasks, like encrypting itself into BIOS' and Windows configuration files, as well as flashing firmware on a host computer's drive.\n\nThis allows the NSA to create a hidden stored partition on a drive they have never had access to, so that when audited, the machine looks and appears normal to anything but these full disk analysis techniques Kaspersky has come up with. Even running software which would wipe the disk and 0 everything out will leave the hidden partition untouched, since the firmware is controlling what the computer sees as actually available sectors.\n\nWhile the NSA and CIA may have interdicted actual server shipments in the past and similar, this is not what is going on here, and it is not a backdoor into every single hard drive that's been made.\n\nIt allows the NSA to target machines which visit certain sites, say, a known terrorist forum, from certain countries (ie certain IP ranges), and compromise them.\n\nIt's a pretty brilliant cyberweapon, and I'm not really sure what the major objections to its use are.\n\nOf course the NSA can do this independently by the way. The NSA conducts security audits of the firmware used in any TEMPEST approved system, so they can request the source code for a legitimate purpose, and then share it with their cyber weapons teams. Once you had the source code for a hard drive's firmware, modifying it becomes pretty-straight forward.\n\nReverse engineering the firmware would be difficult, but not necessarily impossible for an organization of the NSA's resources, and the level of resources necessary to do this across 12 drive vendors is one of the most compelling indications the NSA is responsible.\n\nKaspersky is not accusing the NSA of doing anything at the manufacturing level with hardware companies.

She might lose her husband soon, and she'll be left with a handicapped son as her only \"companion,\" since I imagine everyone else in her life will distance themselves from her.\n\nAGAIN, she should be punished.  But she's also clearly contrite, and her life is already pitiful enough.  \n\nAren't we Reddit?  Aren't we the ones that trash the jail system as broken?  What good would jail do for this woman?  Also, her probation terms set her up for stiff penalties anyway.  \n\nI'll probably get downvoted, but it's just my two cents.  She knows what she did was wrong, she didn't exactly have a great life then or now and really wanted her dream house and lost it (along with her mind, temporarily), and she'll be losing her husband soon.  Let's ease up on the \"SHE'S A WITCH LET'S BURN HER\" mentality.\n\nEdit:  one more thing. I didn't read about any lawsuit, so maybe the couple are saints. But think for a second. While I don't believe anyone is entitled to anything like this, the couple could have stepped back and said, \"hmmm, there's this competing bidder who has disclosed that she has a handicapped kid and a stage four terminal cancer husband. Maybe we could find a different house and let her have this one.\" Yes, that would be an awesome gesture, no they would not be morally or socially required to do it, but it's something to think about. Also, in no way is it their fault that any of the bad things happened to them. I'm just posing food for thought.... I'm sure some couples out there would have conceded the house to the lady.

City jails and county jails typically hold (a) prisoners that have been arrested and are waiting to bond out before trial, (b) people that have been convicted of misdemeanors and are serving short prison sentences. (although short is relative, it can be up to a year, you're right it's usually more like 30 days or less).  \n\nThey also contain people awaiting transfer to the state department of corrections and/or the fed system.\n\nYou get sent to the state department of corrections to actually serve out a year+ sentance after you've been convicted. \n\nThe feds have their own prisons, but also very often pay states for spots in prisojns.

This often leads to people feeling guilty or ashamed of mental illness. This helps to shape how people view the dangers of mentally ill people, thus affecting public policy (which clearly leaves room for improvement).\n\nAll that being said; \"crazy\" is ubiquitous, and is highly integrated into society. I can't make you change your speaking habits, and certainly can't change public discourse; but I feel very strongly that we should be aware of the effects language has on people.\n\nI definitely find myself using \"crazy\" in average conversations, and in the problematic ways I describe; but I've tried to cut it out of my speech as much as possible.

Never mind how school districts will blow thousands of taxpayer dollars in court fighting against giving your child the education they're required by federal law to provide which would be cheaper than the legal fight but if they give in to one special needs family they'll have to accommodate them all and no school district can afford that, which means fuck you and your kid.

The idea that someone who is undocumented and who has a meth conviction would NOT get placed in mandatory detention and NTA'd immediately is just shocking around where I work.

HDD firmware is basically non-upgradable. It just doesn't happen _normally_. So when designing harddrives they put the minimum amount of components necessary. They need a way to write the firmware as that's how the factory puts it on there to begin with, but there is no way to read it.\n\nSo... if you're a bad guy and take apart a HDD and completely reverse engineer [like this guy](http://spritesmods.com/?art=hddhack&amp;page=3) then write new firmware and write over it. There is no way to read back what's on there.\n\n&gt;  If they programmed this into our drives, we should be able to see the symptoms of the illness. \n\nThis is kind of difficult because the drive is literally lying to you. You cannot ask it to read a sector that it doesn't want you to read, because it'll just lie about the contents of said sector. And you can't read the firmware so you can't check if there is a liar installed. \n\nKaspersky did say that the new firmware puts new secret APIs in that allows their other software tools to presumably read/write to those sectors. You could theoretically just attempt to use those APIs and if they're successful you can deduce that you've been infected. I duno though, this is all just internet figuring and without the actual software in front of us and a lot of time to reverse engineer it, we're just shitting in the dark.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l","qSentId": 22721,"question": "\"There is zero chance that someone could rewrite the [hard drive] operating system using public information,\" Raiu said.\n\nWhy?

From the IRS to the NSA and even the Pentagon there is simply no one who has the time to keep up with them let alone regulate or control them.  \n\nCongress I believe is incapable of controlling these programs partly because of incompetence/broken political processes and partly because these agencies have grown so large and powerful that reigning them in is nearly impossible.\n\nOne example of this is the amount of new federal laws being put on the books.  Literally no-one is reviewing them and when asked to produce all the laws that have been added in the last ten years the Library of Congress said the job was too large to tackle.  The vast majority of these laws are being created not by Congress but by the multitude of pseudo-government agencies.\n\nI think in reality that these agencies have grown larger and more important and often times more powerful than Congress.  There is a severe imbalance in our representation and right to redress.  \n\nI really believe the constitution needs to be amended to make these agencies legal and part of the actual government with proper redress and representation.

The question is whether adding more years to a punishment actually adds more of a deterrent.\n\nResearch has generally shown that when it comes to potential punishments criminals are fundamentally irrational. Zero rapes are prevented because no criminals think \"Yeah, I could handle 7 years in prison and a felony record for this but 14 years! 14 years is too much.\" This is because there is a certain element of narcissism to crimes like this where they are thinking that they will never be caught. Therefore punishment alone fails as a deterrent.\n\nViolent crime is also generally associated with poverty. When people are poor and have no ambitions there is less inhibiting the assholes among them from committing crime. Rehab programs generally teach a somewhat employable trade that keeps them off the streets with nothing else to do in addition to basic morals that they obviously were not paying attention to in kindergarten.

You have any idea how many cases would still have to be tried? Either you'd need to spend at least 50x as much on prosecution,  or the offenders wait years and years for trial. And where are you going to put all your violent offenders while they are waiting ten years for trial?

Prohibition does not stop anybody from using drugs, we learned that when we banned alcohol, and anybody who is paying attention knows that it hasn't worked with weed, cocaine, heroin, meth or anything else. If it's legal, it can be regulated and controlled, it will be manufactured safely, without being \"cut\" with adulterants, and doses will be standardized. This means the people who are going to do meth either way, won't be ODing by accident or getting sick or dying because the meth-head who cooked their meth got the recipe wrong or because a dealer wanted to cut it with some random chemical to make a few extra bucks. Plus, reducing the stigma and the degree to which drug users are cast out by society will actually cause a reduction in drug dependency and addiction just on its own. And it will even be harder for kids to get because pharmacies check for ID on controlled substances, illegal drug dealers don't. Currently it is easier for kids to buy marijuana than beer in the US. \n\nYou don't turn a drug addict into a useful member of society by keeping him in a cycle of imprisonment and unemployment.

Because they didn't think it was fair that the girl got a light sentence.  They knew he was guilty, but didn't want to convict him!  Because it wasn't FAIR!  WTF?  The only reason he did get convicted was because the rest of the jury told the 2 divided jurors that with all this evidence, this may be the only time to get him in jail.

Just look up \"Halabja chemical attack.\" When Saddam was in power he had a military draft in order to maintain power and control over but America's invasion has since destabilized the region. Under Saddam, the army would force citizens to enlist or else their families would be harassed and put in danger. Many would then be forced into committing war crimes. My father's uncle was forced into the army as a turret gunner and ordered to mow down hundreds of people during the invasion of Kuwait (IIRC). He eventually had a breakdown, was imprisoned for insubordination, and wasn't released until America invaded.
