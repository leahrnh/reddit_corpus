A boat with just a wooden keel can run the risk of buckling if too many people are in it and it is just supported by attachment points on the bow and stern as during lowering, a boat is designed to have its weight supported by the water along its keel and not by two small points. It is why boats and even some ships have had they \"backs\"/keels broken when caught in the trough between two large waves in rough seas, the bow and stern are supported but the center is not.\n\n&gt;It seems ridiculous in terms of safety that not only were there not enough for every passenger\n\nLooking back it most certainly is absurd. But given the time, a loss of a ship up until recently had meant the loss of all on board, without wireless communication it could mean days, weeks or even months before a ship was noted as being delayed or lost, and even then it wouldn't be known exactly where it had gone down. So even with a lifeboat as a last resort the odds of survival were negligible without wireless, so the prevailing attitude that they were largely unimportant can be understood. With the introduction of bulkheads, large steel ships, and ultimately wireless, engineers and leaders in the ship design world believed that ships could act as their own lifeboats until help could arrive thanks to wireless, and that lifeboats would only be needed to shuttle the passengers between the main ship and the rescue ship. This belief was reaffirmed with the loss of the RMS Republic in 1906. The Republic stayed afloat long enough for help to be summoned and all passengers to be safely evacuated to other ships via the lifeboats. This mindset unfortunately wasn't seriously challenged in the industry until Titanic showed the need for lifeboats in addition to wireless should help not be close enough to get there in time. It is just human oversight in the face of new technology, we focus so much on the rewards of a new tech that we overlook the importance of an old tech. It is like when we (the U.S.) sent F-4s into Vietnam with only missiles and no guns because we considered guns and dog-fighting to be obsolete...quite a few F-4s were lost as a result of the assumption.

An iceberg big enough to cause harm to a ship of that size, should have been easily spotted, the extremely calm sea that night and other factors ended up contributing to it not being spotted.\n3. It was the first large ship like that with water tight bulkheads. Someone had to be first. Nothing is perfect. They thought they were high enough. 20/20 after the fact shows that they were not. This is the early 1900s we are talking about. There are no computer models, there was no previous data. There was just them doing what they thought was best. If the titanic wouldn't have had those bulkheads, most likely only a handful of survivors would have made it off the ship.\n4. The amount of life boats was indeed not enough, but with wireless, the water tight bulkheads, other ships in the common shipping lanes etc, it wouldn't have really been an issue. A lot of the lifeboats went out half or almost completely empty. Any life boats were an improvement where in the past boats didn't even have life boats. 20-30 years earlier, everyone would have just sunk with the ship.\n5. they couldn't have just \"gone back\" and picked up passengers that easily. It's a tall boat. Have to lower the boats down to the water. You expect women and children to fast rope into a life boat 50+ feet down? \nThe Titanic was a huge disaster. It was a \"perfect storm\" situation. If the rudder would have been slightly larger, if they would have slowed down, sped up, if they wouldn't have picked up passengers off the coast of Ireland. If there would have been enough lifeboats. If there would have been a ship closer etc etc. it's a never ending list. The Titanic was the start of an era. There are growing pains. Such large, fast, high capacity ships didn't exist before the Titanic. They were learning. It was a modern marvel. Even 103 years later the Titanic would be a very impressive ship. Every single one of the issues that people list with the Titanic were fixed with the subsequent 2 sister ships. The Britanic still sank, even faster than the Titanic, even though it had improved and higher bulkheads. They were not under the same circumstances, and the Britanic had more survivors, but it also was sunk in warm water and the passengers were more well prepared. Lessons learned from the Titanic saved Britanic and countless other lives.\nTLDR; shit happens, if it floats, it will sink, if it moves, it will crash, if it flys, it will fall.
