Additionally, the Church views homosexual acts as sin - along with a lot of other things that everyone else does. Homosexuality gets a lot of attention, but in reality, homosexuals are not more or less sinful than any other person in the Church.\n\nI hope that begins to clear it up. The idiots with the signs and the megaphones get the attention because they're the loudest and most visible. They do not conform with mainline Christian views at all.\n\nTL;DR: Homosexuality is a sin, but so is being jealous of your neighbor, drinking alcohol to excess, doing drugs, thinking impure thoughts, etc etc. Everyone sins, and that's just how it is.", "aSentId": 49591, "answer": "&gt;TL;DR: Homosexuality is a sin, but so is being jealous of your neighbor, drinking alcohol to excess, doing drugs, thinking impure thoughts, etc etc. Everyone sins, and that's just how it is.\n\nCatholicism holds some sins to be worse than others, though.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13", "qSentId": 49592, "question": "&gt;TL;DR: Homosexuality is a sin, but so is being jealous of your neighbor, drinking alcohol to excess, doing drugs, thinking impure thoughts, etc etc. Everyone sins, and that's just how it is.\n\nCatholicism holds some sins to be worse than others, though.", "aSentId": 49593, "answer": "It certainly does.

You *do* understand that, yes?\n\nEdit - It's also not the same as if those doctors were refusing to treat IS fighters who were POWs. *If* those ten doctors had treated the wounded IS fighters, that literally would have meant contributing to the continuation of the violence on behalf of the enemy.

Players, trainers, management, investors, ... to the fans they all are just temporary phenomena and whoever opposes the fans won't last long anyways. \n\nThe local soccer club where I live is currently not performing well - so its fans have put it on probation.           \nIf performance lives up to their expectations the players get a week of respite. But if the fans feel that the players didn't make enough of an effort they take it upon themselves to \"motivate\" them. By intercepting the team bus and taking the players to task without any barriers or police getting into the way (\"At this point every player must palpably emanate that he has understood the seriousness of the situation\"), by showing up at the practice court to ensure that players are trying hard enough (of course the training is non-public, in theory), and so on. It's plain intimidation but the club endures it because it has little other choice.\n\nIt's a given that part of any ultra group is banned from the stadium. But at home some can find ways to attend anyways, the fan organizations often have enough influence to get the initial penalties reduced and the ability to watch the game in person does not make or break their experience, they'll wait outside the stadium for the match to finish if need be and if necessary they'll do this every weekend for a few years.\n     \nA fun part of the dynamic is that if the fans act out the club gets fined by the league. And clubs lack the means to exact restitution from their fans as a collective, they can only try to get money from those individual perpetrators they could identify - and their ability to pay up generally doesn't come even close to the financial damage suffered by the club.\n\nNormal people go to a soccer match to enjoy the game. For fans the feeling of identity they derive from participating in \"fan culture\" is what's important. Unsurprisingly enemy #1 is (besides the police) is the increasing \"commercialization\" of soccer - because that process tries to redefine fan culture and club identity as something created by skilled PR agencies and controlled by club and league management (whereas currently these concepts are often used to rally against the club management).\n", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13", "qSentId": 52146, "question": "Nope, just sit on the bench until the chant stops.

When the major of Amsterdam tried to change this at a title celebration (as when that stops, the reactions can also stop and this disgusting dynamic can maybe be unraveled and solved), he was ignored, even ridiculed and on stage a Jew song was started right in front of him. It is seen as club culture not to be messed with by officials  or politicians. Many of these people are lower class and actually hate the bobo's and politicians around football, so change will not come from the establishment. \n\nThe solution is simple. There are a lot of camera's in football stadiums. They need to catch the singers on camera and give them bans. Let them get creative with songs other than using the Jew route. However the owners of the club would not have a life anymore. So it must be a collective effort of clubs and police together. As long as this does not happen, I welcome these articles. Maybe they get the context wrong, but it can still create attention and energy to solve this problem. A problem of highly offensive songs that are very insulting to the Jews and their history, but are not exactly indicative of antisemitism. It's a football thing, to insult the other fans to the max.

The reason for the famine was because North Korea was cut off from aid from the Soviet Union, its key ally and weapons/technology supplier, because the Soviet Union didn't exist anymore. Russia was incredibly poor during the 90s and demanded that North Korea start paying back its 11 bilion in debts they incurred during Soviet times. Aid from the West and renewed aid from a growing, resurgent China rehabilitated the country and resolved the food shortage so the wealthy/military class can count on eating three meals a day once more.\n\nDictatorships can have very strong militaries. North Korea does not have a strong military when compared to its neighbors, but it sure as hell is a lot more capable than Mexico's peacekeeping force whom struggles to combat criminals that don't own anything heavier than an assault rifle. It's not even comparable. North Korea's military lives daily in fear that SK or the US would cross the DMZ and Mexico's army is built not to fight conventional enemies, but on providing internal security. And it does a poor job at that. Mexico can hardly combat the cartels that still put fear into the hearts of its everday citizens (note cartels not insurgent groups or guerrilla armies who are much tougher to fight in civil wars) because of the massive corruption in the government and military. Mexico is your typical third world shithole and North Korea is your typical second world communist dystopia.\n\n&gt;Shit son dont be bullshitting me. Their navy is still stuck in the 50s, 60s and 70s their navy is as potent as a museaum ship. Its really hard sinking a ship that is not in a war setting with a midget submarine.\n\nYou have no idea what you're talking about. Cheonan was conducting anti-submarine exercises at the time, and no, they were not somehow caught off-guard because there wasn't a war going on. The ROKN is very much competent and they knew what risks they were taking when they were conducting military exercises with the US which are known to enrage North Korea. Midget subs are incredibly hard to detect by sonar, even the advanced ones mounted on the Po-Hang, and the sinking was a showcase that they are still very lethal.\n\n&gt;If they would go to war with SK or the US they would get creamed because they have absolutely no capabilities of lasting long on the battlefield.\n\nWhen did I argue that the DPRK could defeat the US or SK in battle? Tell me. This really has nothing to do with Mexico, unless you mean to imply that SK and the US would go to war with NK if they invaded Mexico which, again, they will not. My point was that the state of the North Korean navy is not to the point where they will defect to Mexico of all places.\n\n&gt;Their airforce cant fly cuz they dont have fuel and not to mention their planes are no match for anything their neighbouring countries have.\n\nAt least North Korea has more than a dozen aircraft that aren't aging Vietnam-era F-5 freedom fighters. The North Korean's MiG-29 and aging fleet of MiG-21s/MiG-23s are not capable enough to fight against the USAF or ROKAF, but that doesn't mean it's more capable than Mexico's, which, incidentally, was my entire point.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13", "qSentId": 54752, "question": "On that note I'd like the USS Pueblo back from N.

He also presented a lot of data which cautioned people from blaming CO2 levels and global warming the way we do. In fact, the data he presented showed that the first half of the 20th century had much more violent weather than the later half despite climate experts touting that rising CO2 levels and heat would increase violent weather. He didn't deny climate change but he did leave us with a message of caution. A lot of climate experts are in it for the money. A paraphrase of what he said, 'we spend billions of dollars diagnosing the problem and next to nothing actually fixing it'. A first, he said, would be to get actual engineers into the climate change conversation since engineers would be the actually people tackling the problem and would be the people who actually understand the risks and the sacrifices required to decarbonise the world's economy.

Major differences in the past have caused the ocean to 'die'. Granted the ocean is simpler and so can deal with more destruction before it completely extinguishes. \n\n&gt; That is not a feedback system. That is life reacting to changes and the reaction does not mean that a balance will be returned. \n\nLife reacting to the environment, and the environment reacting to life, is indeed a feedback system.

That's not my point. My point is that the *current* set of animals and life that found the current equilibrium 'normal' die off, as the paper in the article above point out. But before that happens, feedback loops do in fact seem to keep the old equilibrium up to a point. For instance, more carbon capture in reefs happens in high-carbon environments because they do better with the extra plant life, up until the point where the equilibrium-seeking behaviour of the ecosystem can't deal with the change, and nature reconfigures to a new stable state. Same deal with algae blooms, which also capture and convert things, up to a point. \n\nYou may ask why do these equilibriums exist? Nature finds them via evolution. Unstable biospheres disappear.

The fans would have to be laid out in rows, and each row progressing inland would be a tier higher.\n\nThis idea is as close as a natural tidal flow as I can think of. We need to replicate the natural cycle as closely as possible, because Nature perfected the mechanisms that facilitated such a diversity and wealth of life. \n\nHaving rows of evenly spaced underwater fans would evenly pull cold water and nutrients from a large area.....rather than simply laying sucker tubing that would unevenly impact regions. \n\nThe problems? The tidal flows, euphotic zones, and Spring Blooms change every year, depending on how El Nino/La Nina, and the regional weather has impacted the deep water currents and coastal temps. These deep water ocean floor fans need to be movable, as well as safe for the marine biology. Think......wind turbines underwater. We do not want to be responsible for chopping up migrating whale pods.....and then there is the problem with maintenance. Stuff is going to encumber the fans......\n\nBecause tidal flows are not consistent, another concept was buoys that collect tidal energy, or even hybrid wind turbines and tidal turbine buoys...collecting energy and transferring it down the anchor line to the underwater fans. \n\nThe problem is, unless funding is allocated to perfect and prioritize these projects and that type of turbine system, and there is competitive engineering which is crucial in making a design affordable and efficient quickly......we are stuck with a solution, and our bare asses in our hands. \n\nThe evidence has been proven. We can artificially move underwater cold currents into the euphotic zones of typical Spring Bloom regions, and catalyze Spring Blooms in dying or dead zones. The present methods and techniques is imperfect, and we need an even network of underwater tech to safely move the water gradually up into the euphotic zones. Underwater tubing dragged about on the floor does not replicate the conditions needed. \n\nPhytoplankton is responsible for at least 50% of our atmospheric O2....some argue plankton is responsible for as much as 85% of our O2, depending on when the blooms coincide with the Northern and Southern Hemispheres Carbon Cycle.\n\n'Farming' phytoplankton is not simply practical.....it is critically necessary. Methods of seeding dying or dead zones with native organisms to consume the plankton is crucial as well, and this type of artificial plankton farming will need to be done until it has reversed the Runaway Greenhouse affect, stabilized the atmosphere, and the tidal transitions/stratified water cycles are stable and running on their own again. \n\nThis is by far the easiest, fastest, and most effective method of healing the oceans ecosystems, addressing the CO2/Greenhouse Effect, putting O2 into the atmosphere, and stopping the possible bottle-neck or extinction of many species....", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13", "qSentId": 57940, "question": "Finding a way to farm phytoplankton in the oceans not only would address the carbon, it would bring back dead zones and many many marine ecosystems. \n\nPhytoplankton is also critically important to O2 production, and it will aid in reducing the runaway greenhouse event we are facilitating......", "aSentId": 57982, "answer": "source?", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13", "qSentId": 57983, "question": "source?", "aSentId": 57984, "answer": "The farming aspect is an idea, however the biology and importance of phytoplankton itself is very basic Biology 101....like middle school level.

One way was much more efficient use of all energy and the development of renewable power resources such as solar, wind geothermal, small hydro, ocean energy and biofuels. Solar passive and active heating, concentrated solar high temperature for commercial, industrial and electrical generation and direct conversion to electricity with photovoltaic cell technologies  were developed and were on the road to being mass produced so they could be affordable alternatives to fossil fuels and nuclear power. Vast areas with wind and geothermal resources had been identified and were ready to develop using available technologies. Existing water systems were being equipped with generators to utilize the flow to produce very low cost power. Alcohol was being added to gasoline or entirely replacing and biodiesil was being used it to reduce petroleum dependency. America was on the road to clean, sustainable domestically produced energy. This path would also help the economy by reducing foreign energy purchases, create new jobs throughout the nation, reduce air pollution and slow or reverse the increase of CO2 that was already considered a threat to climate stability by leading climatologists.\nAnother strategy was pursued by the coal and nuclear industries this strategy was presented to the Edison Electrical Institute in 1974 by the head of Westinghouse. In an address he promoted an all electric economy because he had information that within a decade petroleum would be too expensive to burn in cars, natural gas reserves would be empty and the only way this country could survive would be if the utilities invested in building hundreds if not thousand of enormous coal and nuclear power plants. He stated that Westinghouse and others had developed electric vehicles that by the late 1980s and 1990s would replace millions of cars in the country, also that commercial and industrial operations would replace natural gas with electricity for most thermal processes. He then told the gathered executives of all the electric utilities in the nation that even though the government and the people might oppose this policy that the utilities would have to follow his advice or the country would be devastated and the economy would collapse.\nHe did mention renewable energy but said the wind in Wyoming couldn't provide power to other states and that the sun in the southwest wouldn't help either. Even if transmission existed these technologies wouldn't be ready for deployment until after 2000 and that would be too late to save our country.\nWell Westinghouse, General Electric, big coal, the utilities and their allies got rid of the progressive path and stopped all renewable and efficiency programs in most of the nation. They spent hundreds of billions of rate payer money on so many coal and nuclear power plants that some were abandoned partly completed due to the glut of generation that had been created. The excess inventory of electricity completely destroyed the fledgling renewable industry, electric cars never came to market, more petroleum was available and enormous reserves of natural gas were discovered\nThis deception made billions for the powerplant builders and coal companies but did not bring lower rates to residents and businesses because they where responsible for paying for all the power plants often on high interest 30 year bonds.

I mean, not a Stalin type turd, just a regular turd. \n\nThe issue with Khrushchev is that he made a lot of enemies in the Politburo. While his entire platform was based on the denunciation of Stalin, you have to consider that at this time there were an awful lot of Soviet politicians who owed their entire careers to Stalin, and they felt as if Nikita was throwing them under the bus.\n\nKhrushchev wasn't just responsible for de-Stalinization, he was actually something of a liberal reformer. He rolled back a lot of the most regressive policies in the Soviet Union and ushered in an age of unprecedented personal liberty for the Soviet people. That also rankled a lot of Stalin's hardliners.\n\nThey finally found their chance to take him out after the Cuban Missile Crisis. The general western portrayal of that event is the evil warmongering madman in Moscow was attempting to destroy America, but that conception is flat wrong.\n\nDuring the Eisenhower administration, medium range ICBMs were placed in Turkey very near the Soviet border. These missiles potentially granted the US the ability to launch a decapitation strike on the USSR before the Soviets could respond. Khrushchev, of course, knew this and had been lobbying hard for their removal all along.\n\nHowever, the Soviets had no real way of applying pressure on the US to force them to the table about the missiles until Kennedy's poor handling of Cuba (who was one of the founding members of the non-aligned movement and were mostly ambivalent about the USSR initially) forced them into the arms of the Soviets for protection.\n\nKhrushchev saw a chance to force the US to negotiate by giving them a taste of their own medicine, putting missiles right on their borders. The plan was eventually successful (the US missiles were dismantled and removed from Turkey) but Khrushchev was totally unprepared for the level of shit Kennedy would flip about it. He honestly expected it would be seen as tit for tat, which was basically the unofficial rule of the Cold War, instead of the massive drama bomb it became. \n\nAnyway, while Kennedy kept his word about the missiles in Turkey, they were dismantled and removed in secret, while the Soviet missiles were very publicly removed from Cuba. This meant that it appeared to the world that Khrushchev had lost,  even though he had accomplished exactly what he wanted to.\n\nSo, the Politburo seized on this and used it to make Khrushchev seem weak and incompetent, which lead to his removal from office. Brezhnev was their choice for replacement. He was no Stalin, but he also made no attempt to rock the boat, and rolled back most of the good Khrushchev had done.

According to data from Soviet archives, which were published in 1990, 1,803,392 people were sent to labor colonies and camps in 1930 and 1931. Books say that 1,317,022 reached the destination. Deportations on a smaller scale continued after 1931. The reported number of kulaks and their relatives who had died in labour colonies from 1932 to 1940 was 389,521\"\n\n500,000 of the nearly two million Kulak's deported by the Soviets died before they even reached the labor camps where they were worked to death. Where nearly 400,000 died in absolutely hellish conditions in Russia's wilderness separated from their families and forced to work until they died. \n\n&gt; Like, dude. Why is your historical perspective so skewed that you need to make the Soviets out to be worse than the Nazi's. It's just not true.\n\nBecause you people seem to not understand me very well I'll say it again the Nazis were worse than the Soviets. But not by enough that the actions of the Soviets in areas they conquered should ever be defended. They were absolutely brutal and without mercy nor compassion and led to the deaths of millions of people in politically and racially motivated genocide. ", "aSentId": 59639, "answer": "Yah, my family comes from the Kulak class. I have close relatives that was deported to Siberia and never heard from again. I hate Stalin for what he did in the 30's. But it's important for people to understand that as horrible as the Soviet's were in those days, they are like 10% as bad as the Nazi's would have been.

I'm Ukrainian, and the accepted figure for the casualties during the Holodomor according to many respected Ukrainian historians, as well as Timothy Snyder of Yale, is around 3.5 million. \n\nAccording to the Generalplan Ost, 65% of Ukrainians were to be starved to death. If the population was about 40 million at the time, that means they were planning on repeating the Holodomor with 26 million casualties. 3.5/26 = 13.4%. As a Ukrainian, Stalin was 13.4% as bad as Hitler. Deportation is not as bad as you're making it out to be. It's not good, but it's no where near as bad as death. People get deported unwillingly from the US when they have visa issues, for example. But they're not murdered.\n\nYour comparison is shit. I'm well educated on how fucked up the Bolshiveks and the NKVD was, but again, they weren't as bad as the Nazi's. Not anywhere close to it.\n\n&gt;When the Nazis invaded the Baltic states many places welcomed them as liberators from Soviet oppression. Now ask yourself how bad were the Soviets that the Nazis seemed nice in comparison.\n\nYah, this happened in Ukraine too. Everyone was soooo happy. Then they realized how fucked up the Nazi's were, and JOINED the red army to fight the Nazi's. So they basically KNEW how bad the Soviets were, and still decided the Nazi's were worse. Like, dude.

Or is this just speculation?\n\nI often wonder what would happen if we introduced every species of everything, everywhere in the world at once.  Just let everything mass compete with each other.  Would natural enviremental pressures just push everything towards what we see now?  Or is the world in a state of imballance, held together tenuously and unnaturally by our hands.

It would better allow us to understand how far a species can be pressured before inbreeding prevents it from adapting to enviremental change.

My point is *that*, yes, but broader.  My point is \"humans first\".  Why should this ape be saved?  In what way is it convenient for human life?  There are close relatives that would fill whatever void is left, if a void would be left.  Nature isn't meant to be \"preserved\".
