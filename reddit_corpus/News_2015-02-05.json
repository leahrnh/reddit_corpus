People relate that case to abortion, but the heart of the case was whether States had the right to interfere in medical treatments between a doctor and patient. The answer was no.\n\nI don't think I agree with this interpretation. [Check it out:](http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/410/113)\n\n&gt; The [p154] Court's decisions recognizing a right of privacy also acknowledge that some state regulation in areas protected by that right is appropriate. **As noted above, a State may properly assert important interests in safeguarding health,** in maintaining medical standards, and in protecting potential life. At some point in pregnancy, these respective interests become sufficiently compelling to sustain regulation of the factors that govern the abortion decision. The privacy right involved, therefore, cannot be said to be absolute. **In fact, it is not clear to us that the claim asserted by some amici that one has an unlimited right to do with one's body as one pleases bears a close relationship to the right of privacy previously articulated in the Court's decisions. The Court has refused to recognize an unlimited right of this kind in the past.**\n\nThis part follows page after page of the specific history of abortion: its history in common law recognizing a life-of-the-mother exception to bans on abortion and the many valid medical reasons someone might elect to abort a pregnancy.\n\nIn other words, in a circumstance like vaccines, where there is virtually no health benefit to forgoing a vaccine unless it is medically contraindicated, and where forgoing the vaccine puts at risk others in society and society as a whole, it's hard to see the individual's right of privacy overruling the state's interest in public health.\n\nI think the more likely avenue to block a regime of mandatory vaccinations is a different legal principle, which is the right to refuse medical procedures. I don't know if it would succeed in a constitutional challenge. But I suspect a regime of demanding vaccines as a condition to attending public school would probably work.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l","qSentId": 941,"question": "Well first because it's largely settled case law: Roe Vs.

It's not a case of the vaccines being \"behind\". When deciding which strains to include in the vaccine, they make a prediction as to which strains will be the most virulent in the upcoming year. Predictions can never be 100% accurate, and sometimes they miss the mark. However, even when that is the case, the vaccine still offers some protection against the flu. You may still contract it, but your symptoms will very likely be less severe than if you had not had the vaccine. More than 3,000 people in the US die of the flu every year, mostly children and the elderly.\n\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/qa/disease.htm","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l","qSentId": 1337,"question": "I'm pro-vax, my kids are all up on their vaccines, yay for vaccines and all that.

You aren't hurting the other person you have a personal grudge against by making a worse business decision, you're damaging your own bottom line. For some of those people, money is all that matters and they just make whatever decisions make them the most money. \n\nIn a way, that's kind of the logic why people vote in these businessmen and their ilk into government positions, because people see them as good at one thing and assume that they will use their skills to be good at whatever job they are hired into. You can look at it in sports for example, players can be teammates working together to win a championship and then one of them can go to a different team and work against each other now, but that doesn't mean that they have to hate each other or hold personal grudges, it's just business and making money.\n\nYou could be getting paid to work at Pepsi doing marketing, and if you're good at it, Coca Cola isn't going to shun you for being good at the job Pepsi hired you to do, they're going to try to recruit you to do that job for them.

If Coca Cola will pay you more, there's nothing personal if you leave Pepsi to go work for Coca Cola.

At 43 years old I'd say I've seen a lot of the bad side of government and the wasteful bureaucracy that goes with it.\n\nThe trouble is when you say things like the government AND corporations should \"keep their nasty little hands off\" the internet, how do you propose to do that? Who is going to tell Comcast to keep their nasty little hands out of it? \n\nNot all government is bad. There's a reason we have things like the Sherman Act and antitrust laws. When a company has grown so large and powerful that they can control access to goods and services by artificial means outside the rules of supply and demand; or stifle competition, and not because they have superior products and services, but simply because they can afford to drive everyone else out... someone has to have the authority to stop them. \n\nI get the impression you are probably a big fan of laissez faire capitalism. It's just a guess, but I bet you are probably also a fan of small, limited government. You probably have a lot of respect for the founding fathers and the Constitution. If I have that right, then I want you to consider something written in the Declaration of Independence. I think Jefferson pointed out something really important. There's a line in the Declaration that reads as follows:\n\n\"Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.\"\n\nAll experience has shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves. Here's the trouble with that. One of the key parts of a free-market is the idea of the dollar vote. Ideally, people aren't supposed to do business with companies they hate and companies that treat them poorly or take advantage of them. Ideally, people will only buy from companies that offer them the best products and services at the best price, and in doing so, the cream will rise to the top. I know how it is supposed to work.\n\nIdeally, yes. But in reality, people are more apt to suffer while things are sufferable. They just are. It's in our nature. We have busy lives and we know we hate Comcast, but Rather than go without internet, when Comcast pulls stunts and offers bad service or treats people poorly - because there isn't much of an alternative that doesn't cause us a lot of pain, loss or hassle - people don't boycott. They just don't. Comcast is rated as one of the most hated companies in America, and yet people still keep buying from them. When you read about how free-markets work, it isn't supposed to work that way. And because people keep buying from them, those companies keep getting rich enough to buy people off, to lobby the government to keep themselves in control, to stifle competition and so on. \n\nIf you are waiting for the free-market to drive companies like Comcast out of the market, you are going to be waiting a long time. If you think people are going to rise up and boycott companies the betray the ideas behind net neutrality; well, they aren't going to. Someone who represents us is going to have to do it. Someone who represents us is going to have to have the legal authority to slap companies like Comcast around and make them behave decently.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l","qSentId": 3411,"question": "What most don't get is that it would give FCC regulatory powers over the internet.

Your major competitor is Home Depot, who also sell lumber, among other things.  You can compete with them because you are specialized and can offer a higher quality product and better service, as lumber is your industry, not retail.  Home Depot competes by having better brand recognition and using economies of scale.  You both have your customers, and everyone's happy.\n\nBut imagine if Home Depot was not only your competitor, but also owned all of the roads in your area, the roads you need to use if you're going to deliver your lumber to your customers.  Now, Home Depot is demanding that you pay a fee to use their roads, and because they have a monopoly in your area, there are no other roads available to use.  Obviously, you don't have the money to build your own roads, you're just a little lumber yard.

Comcast can absolutely do what ever they want with their roads, including destroy them.

Here is a quote from an [article](http://venturebeat.com/2015/02/03/source-fcc-will-reclassify-internet-as-public-utility-att-and-verizon-will-immediately-sue/) I read this morning about this stuff: \"It might spur members of Congress on both sides of the aisle to reach an accord over a new network neutrality law. The law, in fact, has already been introduced: **The legislative proposal provides protections against Internet \u201cfast lanes,\u201d** but it does not go so far as to reclassify the Internet under Title II. The bill is **sponsored by a couple of Republicans** \u2014 Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) and Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.) \u2014 and has **almost no support from congressional Democrats.**\"\n\nIn any case, though there are some who may oppose it without understanding it, I think it's dangerous to assume that this is generally or universally true.

The Earth Day demonstrations were bigger than any progressive protests before, not the Civil Rights Movement's March on Washington, nor the biggest anti-war demonstrations. It wasn't a political issue, it was just common sense (like net neutrality).\n\nAnd then the corporate propaganda blitzkrieg started and everything from acid rain to global warming to endangered species protection started being portrayed as some kind of extremist left-wing anti-business agenda (as it still is today).

If you have any questions by all means ask. If you see any discrepancies please call me out on it. Also I'd like to disclose that I am neither Republican nor Democrat, I consider myself as a Independent since both sides have great ideas, but they both have some very bad ideas. I am also for Title II and Net Neutrality, I have also worked in IT and am currently working in Networking. Finally I live in Southern California and have AT&amp;T U-Verse Business as my ISP.\n\n&gt; What else does it mean?\n\nA Title II reclassification of ISP's will allow the FCC to regulate them without issue and in a timely manner.\n\nAs of right now, this is not possible because companies like AT&amp;T are claiming they are Title II providers so they can't be regulated by the FTC and then they turn around and say they aren't Title II to the FCC so they can't be regulated by them either.^[\\[1\\]](http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/att-to-ftc-we-can-throttle-data-and-you-cant-stop-us)\n\nAnd this isn't just AT&amp;T. Verizon, Comcast, and Time Warner have been doing the same thing for years now, even going as far back as the Telecommunications Act of 1996 where these companies took approximately $200 Billion dollars of tax payer money in exchange for building out infrastructure, which never happened.^[\\[2\\]](http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/2007/pulpit_20070810_002683.html)\n\nIf these companies do not comply when Title II is approved then they can be broken up like the AT&amp;T monopoly was in 1982.^[\\[3\\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System)\n\n&gt; this vote isn't over \"can we throttle internet or not\".\n\nYou're correct, but that is what Net Neutrality will fix^[\\[4\\]](http://www.macworld.com/article/1132075/netneutrality1.html). When Net Neutrality ended in the U.S. back in January 2014, services like Netflix were immediately being throttled by Comcast^[\\[5\\]](http://mattvukas.com/2014/02/10/comcast-definitely-throttling-netflix-infuriating/) and Verizon^[\\[6\\]](http://www.extremetech.com/computing/177073-why-netflix-streaming-is-getting-slower-and-probably-wont-get-better-any-time-soon). With Net Neutrality ISP's cannot do this.\n\n&gt; How else does reclassifying internet as a public utility effect how the internet will be distributed, received and used?\n\nWell this is where there can be a Catch-22, with Title II classification ISP's could continue with how they operate and could get worse, but they will now be opened up to true competition instead of the oligarchy they have now.\n\nRight now, unless you're as big as Google, if you try to start up your own ISP business you'll be swarmed with litigation from ISP's saying you can't and more than likely even bankrupting you so you can't fight them in court. Google is getting away with this because they have the money to fight it in the areas they are expanding in, which is a great example because now that ISP's in Austin, Provo, and Kansas City are finally seeing true competition all of their customers are getting free upgrades with faster speeds and even AT&amp;T announced their \"Giga Power\" service which is gigabit speeds over *fiber*. AT&amp;T has never done fiber to residential houses since it's \"too expensive\", but now that Google Fiber is coming to Austin then magically they can offer gigabit fiber without an issue? Comcast and Time Warner have both increased customer speeds in those Google Fiber areas as well.\n\nI know I might sound a bit biased here, but if ISP's were classified as Title II nearly a decade ago I bet all major cities and neighborhoods in a 50 miles radius would have at least gigabit fiber available today. I don't like having a government agency step in to fix this, but this won't get fixed unless the government does step in. As I said before with the Catch-22, there will more than likely be issues in the beginning, but I truly believe in the long run it will be worth it.

Not being too knowledgeable about the provider industry this part is the only thing confusing me.  Can someone ELI5?\n\n&gt; To preserve incentives for broadband operators to invest in their networks, my proposal will modernize Title II, tailoring it for the 21st century, in order to provide returns necessary to construct competitive networks. For example, there will be no rate regulation, no tariffs, no last-mile unbundling.\n\nIs he just saying that they won't control or tax rates? What is last-mile unbundling?","aSentId": 4597,"answer": "\nI doubt this will be fully to your liking but here it goes. \n\nNo rate regulation means that they will not tell the ISP they are charging too much. For instance if you have a 50/5 connection, and no competition in your area, they can charge you say 100 dollars for that connection. While your neighbor could have a different provider with say 100/100 connection for 70, and they are saying that they will not come in and say the 50/5 connection should be cheaper. \n\nAs for tariffs in this instance I am not sure what exactly they mean, but I will assume they mean during competition like say ISP A leases lines to ISP B, they will not come in and tax ISP B in a way that could give a benefit, and or barrier to entry so that ISP A can maintain a competitive advantage. \n\n\n&gt;What is last-mile unbundling?\n\nThe last mile unbundling is sort of like local loop unbundling. The last mile in cable infrastructure is typically represented as fiber to the node, and cable from the node to the house. The cable from the node to the house being what the ISP's can still control, and can't \"unbundle\". So say a new ISP comes into the area and wants to provide you service. They can use the fiber to the node, but not the cable from the node to your house. So if they wanted to \"compete\", they would have to lay their own cable from the node to your house. If we actually get some competition into the market say 3 or 4 ISP's competing, then at some point you could potentially have 3 or 4 drops going to your house.

Say 35 dollars for 30/5, 50 dollars for 60/10, etc. \n\nNow with that said, Obama and Wheeler have made clear they don't want to bring in those kinds of pricing controls.

What happens if that traffic is not supposed to be equal?  What about real time traffic like Skype, Facetime and other Video/Audio Teleconferencing applications? Obviously these are very important on the internet.  What if ... just what if, your ISP decided to offer an internet package that \"guaranteed\" Skype/Facetime/Audio/Video traffic got priority so that you could enjoy a crystal clear session at no extra cost?  \n\nNews flash, under Net Neutrality this would never be allowed. Ever! Nor would your ISP be able to actually prefer Netflix/Hulu/YouTube.  I guess the applications are not important to anyone. \n\nEveryone here \"hates\" the ISP but have you ever noticed that only those that want Net Neutrality are the ones that do not actually pay for the last mile to the house.  Google is the exception to this in a very minor way.  Yep, Netflix absolutely relies on that last mile infrastructure and they pay nothing for it.  \nEssentially what people are asking here is for the large ISP's to subsidize Netflix, Google and other large \"Non-ISP, content providing\" entities.  There is no other way to look at it.  This is the same fight that AT&amp;T had with Vonage and other VoIP startups.  \n\nMore laws have never made anyone more free.  One man's freedom in this case is another mans chains.  We are oh so happy to chain up those we do not like and give the freedom to those we do, when underneath it all we know both are only out to get money from us.  More laws just ensures that the one who has more lawyers and lobbyists, gets more freedom than the other guy who lost.  \n\nAnd on that note, what \"restrictions\" are on the internet now? Isn't the internet already \"free\" from restrictions? I ask what regulations on are the internet right now?  Do we really want to give more power to the government to regulate the \"freedom\" we have now? Right now the internet is free.  There are no restrictions on who can do what, when and where.  Is that not the definition of Freedom? I can do what I want, when I want, and how I want to do it? Or is that we cannot handle this freed internet and demand that everybody, regardless of their abilities be equal?  \n\nPeople can be free, but not equal and equal people are not free. One companies win \"for freedom\" just binds that companies freedom to the will of the winner.  \n\nIn short net neutrality is not good and never will be good.  The internet is already free.  Some people just don't like the fact that freedom is messy and want to control it.  The internet will sort things out.  It always has and always will, just maybe not on the same time frame as the infinite wisdom that is professed by all reddit users. :) ","aSentId": 4724,"answer": "Should employers be unregulated or should they be allowed to do whatever they want to their employees?","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l","qSentId": 4727,"question": "If internet is a public utility, doesn't that mean it gets billed by use like electric and water?

Yet, the media often examines the claims politicians make about their past. For example, Hilary Clinton famously claimed during the 2008 presidential primary to have come under sniper fire when landing in Bosnia some years earlier. Yet, contemporary media coverage revealed a greeting ceremony on the tarmac in which a Bosnian child read her a poem \u2014 no snipers.

I think the Vietnam war was the first to really drop the curtain, so to speak, in regards to the brutality of war. WW2 and prior all had the distinct inclusion of propaganda which would continue a countries nationalistic views and desire to destroy the enemy. Once TV was at the point where they could broadcast live from the warzone, and show the horrors of battle, people started to see the truth and that it isn't some epic adventure in the name of freedom. Sometimes it's for self defense and progress, don't get me wrong, but often times it's an ugly tactic humans use to get what they want when diplomatic options (if those options were ever on the table at all) fail. In response to your comment about crime scenes... I feel that is different because it is a singular act effecting 1 or a few individuals privately, but when it comes to war... everyone is involved so information needs to be readily available to make sure all the right decisions are being made. Often times they aren't, even with full disclosure of information. Then again, how can we trust that we are being shown everything and not just another narrative or propaganda device?

It was 4 years ago but I still remember the sounds very explicitly and it will stick with me forever. The screams, the sound of the blade cutting thru his neck and hitting bone, the last breathes of someone dying a horrific and terrifying death, the sounds of him gurgling on his own blood while trying to breath or cry. Those make it so much more real than reading the someone was beheaded. Those things can never be truly expressed through reading about it.

When the results come in, my GP sends me to an ENT 2 weeks later to discuss and book having my sinuses operated on. So from the initial meeting with my GP to being operated on took just under 2 months. Maybe some people think thats long but I would have to disagree because A) I went most of my life being unable to breathe - an extra 2 months is nothing, and B) Everything was covered by OHIP (our provincial health plan we pay into via taxes) \n\n\n* Younger brother played for Ontario Rugby, he had a bad accident on the field and was taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital shortly after.

Keep in mind I am was specifically mentioning a panic disorder above and not general anxiety disorder. \n\nThe reason I make the distinction is this:  often what happens is a patient is given Valium 5 take one twice a day as needed, given #60.  Often, patients will take this to mean that since I have enough to take twice daily routinely for a month that I should.  What I see happen is exactly what you describe - their anxiety is numbed enough they can avoid their problems.  Their problems worsen, they become more resistant to the drug, and need more and more to keep their anxiety in check until it doesn't work anymore.  This is a very different pattern than taking Valium 3-4 times a month.\n\nAnd, while I agree in theory that the first 2 weeks of misery are worth it in the long run, many patients refuse to do it.  And honestly, for 3-4 episodes a month, is it really fair to expect someone to take a daily med with potential side effects?

","aSentId": 8451,"answer": "I'm just telling you one of the many reasons why its not prescribed. But I'll gladly list out all the ones I discuss one a regular basis though this is not an all encompassing list as its very person to person depending on given situation. \n\nFirst it's not for long term treatment (greater than a 1-2 months is considered long term) of anxiety disorders and a person will fairly quickly have build tolerance (within weeks to months) requiring higher doses to get the same effect. If you do escalate the dosing you fairly quickly you reach the ceiling on their usefulness (amounts you can safely dose and be considered within standard of care as that is what physicians are judged against) and now have to talk about stopping the medication and implementing a taper. And the SSRI discontinuation syndrome is not equivocal to withdrawal from a Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic (Benzo, Barbiturates etc) or alcohol as if you suddenly stop these medications you will go through a potentially life threatening withdrawal. Yes SSRI Discontuation is a real effect and can be extremely uncomfortably (in some cases people have had severe anxiety rebound warranting psychiatric admission) but physically they are at no risk from dying from the withdrawal itself. Though the discomfort level can be severe it's not commonly found to be severe and for most people short lived (1-3 days). \n\nYes obviously you want to schedule out a taper for all medications that warrant it and have potential for discontinuation/withdrawal syndromes (or to simply cross titrate one agent for another) but it sometimes doesn't happen due to various reasons. Some examples though this is not an exhaustive list include the the physician goes on vacation and the patient runs out while they can't be contacted, the person decides they are going to stop abruptly against medical advice for whatever reason of their own choosing, maybe insurance providers change and a previously covered medication is now not covered, maybe the pharmacy won't dispense more because a person lost their supply,  maybe they get into a car accident and are in a coma and the ICU doctors can't reach family to confirm their home medications (though this is getting to be less of a problem with Pharmacies submitting controlled substances to a centralized database that providers can reference). \n\nAlso you should not operate heavy machinery with the medication (that include cars) as the medication works on the same chemical pathway as alcohol which means you are at greater risk of having a car accident similar to as if you were drinking alcohol. This also means that technically you can be charged with driving under the influence (DUI) or Operating a Motor Vehicle Impaired (OMVI) if you were to get into an accident. Effects from this medication can include cognitive slowing, sedation, disinhibition, worse school/school performance, rebound anxiety, and depending on age/physical health can lead to increased risk of Delirium (which is heavily underdiagnosed in a hospital setting). This is especially true if they become medically frail/sick and having to discontinue or taper a benzodiazepine in this while a person is delirious can be difficult and put the patient at increase risk.     \n\nCombining alcohol and benzodiazepines unintentionally (excessive alcohol is commonly found in conjunction with anxiety disorders as a form of self medication) or intentionally as a suicide attempt (Panic disorders are a significant risk factor for suicide attempt) also pose another prominent risk with using such medications. Taking into account that SSRI, SNRI and the other antidepressants have shown to be better at treating anxiety disorders on a long term basis as well have significantly less risk of overdose or issues with combined alcohol consumption it makes the decision easier. \n\nThese are not uncommon issues and are something you have to seriously consider at the outset. Are there times when a benzo is the correct medication choice? Of course but it is definitely not a long term solution and a full discussion of the risks of any medication should be discussed. \n","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l","qSentId": 8446,"question": "Yeah, it's much better to just live in constant fear your whole life than find any sort of relief.

When I tried explaining that I was having moral conflicts and just sort of, picturing conversations in my head (characterizing different parts of a personality, really, not that deranged), he leaded me into say that, yes, I was hearing voices and I should take Risperdal. I remember asking him for how long and he said, \"for now, consider it forever.\"\n\nSeven months later I was up 40 pounds. I had never even noticed it was happening because I had no idea ANYTHING was happening. It's one of those drugs that promises you'll stop feeling the bad stuff because you'll be numb to feeling pretty much anything real. I have no idea how I graduated college. I've also suffered from some of the sexual dysfunction mentioned in other posts, as well as premature hair loss and a few other bonuses. This was eight years ago and I'd say it took maybe two years to recover physically and another 4 to level out emotionally after that. By then, the things I'd originally sought out therapy for were so far behind me and yet I was still being kicked in the ass by what had been called the \"solution.\"  This wasn't a drug borne from sympathy, it was a drug made for the sake of having another drug.\n","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l","qSentId": 8488,"question": "I took this drug when I was 12 and what it did to me was awful.

I was 250 lbs and being forced onto diets while still playing flag football and being on swim team.

Thus, the drug only hits the D2 receptor and not the side-effect causing D3 receptor. In actuality it is much more nuanced, but that is the general gist. If you would like to read more, the link below has a much more scientific explanation.\n\nThe reason I know about this drug is because I'm on a team that is trying to get the licensing rights from the NIH in order to bring this drug to market. Hopefully we can make some progress in the near future, but I wanted people to know that hope exists.\n\nhttp://www.neurostartupchallenge.org/invention-4.html\n\n**TL;DR: A new drug is likely to drastically reduce these side effects, but it has not gone through FDA testing yet.

The issue of slavery was major politics since the beginning of the US and the contentious politics over slavery directly lead to the Civil War.  \n\n[The Missouri Compromise](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_Compromise), passed in 1820, tried to resolve the slavery debate by forbidding slavery above the 30 36 latitude. They made an exception to Missouri so that the number of Slave states and Free states would be equal in congress. Slavery directly affected the political make up of congress before the war. However the [Kansas-Nebraska act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas%E2%80%93Nebraska_Act) in 1854 wrecked the peace by repealing the Missouri compromise and allowing people in a new state to vote whether they wanted to be a Slave state or Free state. Kansas essentially went into a state of civil war. There was open gun and cannon fire and the state actually had two different governors and two different state governments for awhile. In many ways Kansas was a warning of things to come. Disagreements on the treatment of Runaway Slaves antagonized both Northern abolitionists and Slave owners. The politics of slavery was so contentious that it split the Democratic party between Northern Democrats and Southern Democrats, allowing abolitionist Republican Abe Lincoln to win with 40% of the vote. Though he would have kicked their ass in the electoral college even if the Democrats had not split.  South Carolina succeeded before Lincoln was even sworn into office because they viewed him as a threat to the continued practice of slavery and they felt cheated in the election. By the time Abe entered office he indeed put the issue of slavery on the back burner because his primary goal was to preserve the union and prevent Civil War. Much of the failed peace process was about trying to pass an amendment guaranteeing southern states the right to own slaves. The Civil War started and as part of economic war strategy, personal abolitionist reasons, historical justification, and moral legacy reasons Lincoln re-crafted the war so that the victor would determine the fate of slavery in the US once and for all. This process started in 1862, hardly the end of the war. It would be a lie to say that the Civil War was not about slavery. The Civil War was about States rights...to slavery.

Rather, in most elections, voters see the candidate's party listed on the ballot.  (There are also primary elections used before the main election to select who the official candidate of each party will be.)  This is unlike most parliamentary systems around the world.  Americans never vote directly for a party, for instance.\n\nThe closest thing comes with those government positions that are appointed by elected individuals.  In theory, a party could put pressure on that elected official to appoint someone to that post, and often times, such as with ambassadorships, the person appointed was a big fund raiser for the party.  (Ambassadorships are unusual because each embassy has a charge d'aiffaires, who is a career State Department official, and is the actual \"brains\" of the operation - the ambassador is typically ceremonial - except in very serious situations, such as career diplomat Chris Stevens, who was ambassador to Libya after Gadaffi's over-through, as an example.)\n\n\nIn this case, it's an election to the State Supreme Court, and many Americans think that having an election to select judges who decide on constitutional matters is a terrible idea, and allowing them to bring in party politics is even worse.

While 51.76% of the votes in the election went to Moore, in a state with only 3.7 million voting age residents, this amounts to 24.67% of the eligible population electing Moore to office. The percentage drops if you want to include the under-18 crowd.\n\nSo while there are a good number of Alabamians who need to think hard about their beliefs, and maybe re-evaluate their stances, we also need to work on getting people out to vote.

You can certainly enter into a non marriage contract but the point of marriage is to legally join two people as kin thus conferring the rights of kinship to each other.

The right to make medical and life decisions for each other. etc.\n\n[Here are just a small sample of the 1400+ legal rights and privileges of marriage](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/marriage-rights-benefits-30190.html) For each of these you would have to enter into a separate contract, marriage confers them all.

I think it is a similar fight that would need to be fought in terms of lobbying, in terms of pushing new laws being signed in. Using the current marriage law as a model, it would not have to be \"from scratch\". But again, there is no easy solution. \n\nI'll close with I support modifying the current law to include homosexual couples.

Those states who modified their law had to go through how many years of fighting and lobbying? Are you kidding? It was amazingly complicated and a huge fight - one that I might agree is a valid argument (as in I do think it is fair to make modification to the law).\n\nBut considering the effort to make the change, and the fact that yes...homosexual marriages and heterosexual relationships **are** different by any definition other than emotional. That's not homophobic, that's the blunt truth. You may want to take that as me saying it is worse, but no...simply different. There is nothing wrong with that, so stop acting like there is.\n\nAs it is different, a different law should be written for a different situation. Yes - an objective approach needs to be taken when it comes down to the law. There is no room for emotional argument, otherwise we are using a line of emotion to decide law! Chaos.\n\nWhat if someone makes a compelling case to be married to a dog? A computer program/AI? Why would that be different? Maybe because those things aren't human?

All factors considered it does make sense.","aSentId": 11154,"answer": "The argument is indeed that the state should not have a say in if a man wants to marry another man or a woman another woman. \n\nBut I mean, I was more stating how gay marriage bans are being fought and they're obviously losing so I'm sure the federal judges agree with the fact that the 14th Amendment protects gay marriage. \n\nSo I disagree that it's not a constitutional thing when it's being ruled unconstitutional using the constitution.\n\n\nAnd sorry for the super condescending first line btw since this post seems a lot less aggressive than your last one.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l","qSentId": 11155,"question": "The argument is indeed that the state should not have a say in if a man wants to marry another man or a woman another woman. \n\nBut I mean, I was more stating how gay marriage bans are being fought and they're obviously losing so I'm sure the federal judges agree with the fact that the 14th Amendment protects gay marriage. \n\nSo I disagree that it's not a constitutional thing when it's being ruled unconstitutional using the constitution.\n\n\nAnd sorry for the super condescending first line btw since this post seems a lot less aggressive than your last one.","aSentId": 11156,"answer": "hey its all good buddy i just get a little fired up over law(not gay marriage) i just think people bring the constitution into everything and it kind of undermines its intent, but hey its already fucked so if gays can use it to get married more power to em i hope it works.\n","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l","qSentId": 11158,"question": "state law supersedes federal law. just want to point out this isn't me saying I agree with the law.","aSentId": 11159,"answer": "And the state law was deemed unconstitutional, which is kinda like them not allowing it to be a law.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l","qSentId": 11160,"question": "And the state law was deemed unconstitutional, which is kinda like them not allowing it to be a law.","aSentId": 11161,"answer": "deemed such in a federal court. not the states court.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l","qSentId": 11162,"question": "deemed such in a federal court. not the states court.","aSentId": 11163,"answer": "Federal court rulings apply to states in the district in which they are decided.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l","qSentId": 11158,"question": "state law supersedes federal law. just want to point out this isn't me saying I agree with the law.","aSentId": 11165,"answer": "I think you've got that exactly backwards.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l","qSentId": 11167,"question": "The Tenth Amendment notes that the states or the people retain those powers not delegated to the federal government.\n\nThere's nothing in the constitution stating the federal government has **any** authority over marriage.  So the ability to legislate marriage belongs to the states.  This means Alabama can ban gay marriage while California allows it.\n\nBecause it's blindingly obvious to everybody that the federal government has no authority over marriage of any kind, those so inclined frame the issue of banning gay marriage as one that violates the 14th amendment's equal protection clause - the same amendment that gave [former] slaves the same rights as every other citizen.\n\nRoe v Wade is another instance where the federal government overstepped its bounds:  there's nothing in the constitution giving the federal government power over abortions, so the issue was spun a violation of the 14th amendment's right to privacy.\n\nBrown v Board of Education is another:  public schools (owned by the taxpayers by virtue of being public) wanted to segregate.  The federal government has no authority to tell states what they can and can't do with their schools, so it was argued that the 14th amendment was again violated","aSentId": 11168,"answer": "\"It's blindingly obvious the federal government has no authority over equal rights except for explicitly in the amendment that I mentioned several times that requires equal rights.\"","corpus": "reddit"}]
