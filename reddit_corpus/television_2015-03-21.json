The setting is fundamentally interesting. You watch the President hear about it and see how it affects him. You see what his aides have to do about it. You sit in the war room. Now imagine that after they do each and every thing, they turn around and say \"Barack Obama wouldn't have that kind of balls\" or \"we're doing it this way because we're good, unlike bad people who wouldn't do it this way!\" That becomes significantly more obnoxious. I don't really care about what others would do when I'm watching a fictional show--I just care that the characters I'm watching are worth cheering for and doing interesting things.\n\nThat latter, obnoxious case is a *fundamental* need in the Newsroom. And the reason is, let's say an American hostage is taken. The Newsroom setting is fundamentally *uninteresting*. All the action is happening in the White House or wherever the hostage is, the act of simply talking about those events in a straightforward manner is uninteresting.\n\nThe premise of the show, however, was the idea that what would make straightforward news interesting is the fact that it's just so rare in these days of cable news. That means that our heroes are doing cool things only when compared with people who are doing things we don't like. So if Will McAvoy hears about a hostage, he can say \"Our President is doing his best during this difficult time, and he deserves our support,\" or he can say \"Our President deserves our support during this tough time and you goddamn Tea Party Lunatics on Fox News are tearing the very fabric of our country apart by not showing him the respect I am showing him.\" If he says the former, it's a boring TV show. If he says the latter, it's an obnoxious TV show.\n\nThat's why I would hesitate to pin it on the writing. I don't think there is a script that could exist for that show that wouldn't make it hard to watch. The premise is just a no-win situation. And Sorkin wrote the premise, obviously, but it's not like anyone's acting like he's some premise maestro--his shows have been \"watch the President and his staff\", \"Watch a news team and its staff\" and \"Watch a news team and its staff,\" and his movies have been nonfiction book adaptations.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh6e", "qSentId": 14624, "question": "If this can go through, how about considering a new West Wing starting with Sam Seaborn's run for office and his presidency?

Or even just focused even more so on one or the other to fulfill that category. The producers/writers wrote the show they wanted too, not the show they wanted to win, which is what television should be. \nYou guys act like and Emmy nomination is right from god himself and he's somehow unfairly classifying the show as either too funny or too dramatic. It's an award, a prestigious one nonetheless, but it doesn't change the quality of the show.\n\nHowever seeing some people here compare it to BrBa, the Emmy destroyer for the past 8 years, is sad to me. BrBa, acclaimed by most as the greatest show to hit television, and bested (in critics minds) only by the wire. Hell, it was the first show I noticed people started *openly* calling better than The Sopranos. Which, at the time, was a HUGE deal. I haven't seen The Wire yet so I can't attest to that opinion honestly, but BrBa will forever hold a special place in my heart. Over the Sopranos, over GoT, over True Detective, week to week, the only time I was disappointed in BrBa was the \"fly\" episode. Whereas I sometimes look at the male characters in OITNB and realize they are EXTREMELY one dimensional.\nThe boyfriend who's waiting on the other side dates her best friend (kind of out've nowhere, it just kind of POOF's, he's into her. Yeah I get it she's hot but so is Piper maybe even more so than her.). Kind of cliche.\nThe prison manager (who is fat, grey haired, constantly grumpy, and pretty much the walking cliche of a power hungry figure of authority.) ends up not watching piper... As a murder takes place?.. Doesn't almost EVERY prison have cameras? **especially outside???** oh and he also becomes very rapey a few times, as if the walking power hungry cliche wasn't enough. \nI'm not even gonna go into porn-stache. He's literally so one dimensional they should've just cast a piece of paper to play him. Not too mention how they make a HUGE deal of him returning, only to resolve it in a half an episode. \nThen there's the classic \"nice guy\" cliche. Sure he just wants to help the prison but he just doesn't have *the power* to help, or the motivation? Or he's looking out for his colleagues? I honestly don't know. I just know his entire purpose is to be that 'nice guy' who \"can't\" do something he should be doing. Poor chris is the most feminine one cast of course he's gonna be the \"nice guy\" cliche. \nI can go on and on, but I won't. I find the male characters In OITNB to be very one dimensional. Whereas the female characters in BrBa had fluid, changing emotions/thoughts/feelings. With such amazingly written characters as Wendy, Andrea, Jane, Spooge's wife; the skank, BrBa's most one dimensional female character is Marie, and even she unravels (emotionally) around seasons 3 and 4 and from there on just sort of spirals into a different person. I feel like the girls from BrBa came from life, the real world, real people. On the other hand I look at some of the male characters in OITNB and sometimes find myself wondering if every man on it is just a way for them to address every single cliche they possible could. \nDon't get me wrong, I LOVE OITNB, it's really good, one of the best shows out there by far! \nBut, as a male, I sometimes watch the show and literally cringe, at how badly written the male characters are. \n/endrant\nI know I'm responding to like, a sentence, so to the original commenter: I'm not aligning your views with or against any of the above views I mentioned.
