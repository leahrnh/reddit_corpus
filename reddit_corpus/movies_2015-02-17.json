You're talking about the actual cutting of scenes from the dailies and such, while I'm talking about shot to shot expression and such? Usually, when producing and shooting a film, the \"dailies\", the day's worth of unedited footage, is sent off to the editor so that they can pick the best performances and timing of the cuts. But what I believe happened in Birdman that makes this practice a little different is that it becomes difficult to edit between say, two different takes of a scene in one sequence of dialogue to get the best performances from each one when everything is done in one take. I guess part of what makes oners so impressive is that you have to appreciate how everything was *right* in that one take. Thus, if we use the metaphor of a superhero suit for this one take movie, it becomes a collaboration of the director tailoring the suit and working with the actor on how to wear it and forming the movie to the needs of actors and the director's own artistic flair, while the editor is relegated to mending the superhero suit wherever a rip is noticeable.\n\nSorry if I sound overly didactic or condescending I never know to gauge the knowledge of others (i. e. the definition of daily)","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3s","qSentId": 104,"question": "But we do see what they cut.

There are days that happiness can be legitimately felt, but not without the \"Something's bound to give\" mentality that comes with it; it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy when something inevitably goes wrong, be it my fault or a completely random incident, and it hastily falls into the \"I figured it would fail anyway\" category. The absolute worst is when everything just piles up one after another, and when it goes well beyond the point of feeling cornered and claustrophobic with all the obligations, duties, deadlines, requirements, and not getting the time you need to wind down, there's suddenly a quiet little voice that just springs up and says, \"Pfft, should've killed yourself when you had the chance. You don't need to deal with all this shit if you're dead.\"\n\nThe mind is so scary sometimes.","aSentId": 1909,"answer": "Sorry, I wasn't clear.

The extent of your \"Im really sorry that happened to you\" can only go as far as you empathizing by putting yourself in the other person's place and letting your imagination run with what you know and feel in regards to loss. People can mean well when they express their concern with the seemingly cookie cutter words like \"Let me know if you need anything\" or \"You're in my prayers\", but it does get very infuriating to hear it because almost everyone who says things like this doesn't follow through with their actions. They don't know just how frustrating it could be dealing with someone with depression and suicidal tendencies/thoughts, and when they realize how much of a task they've unintentionally burdened themselves with, they tend to retreat or try to push you off in another direction.\n\nI think a pity party is the last thing someone with depression needs, because that suggests that he/she needs to be looked at like a lost, dying puppy. No, what's really needed are people--hell even a single person--who will actually listen and see this person through from start to finish, because professional help only lasts as long as youre able to pay for it; it's the good people in a person's life that can try to help reinforce the lessons gained from therapy and the balance from ingesting medications, and that kind of help speaks far louder than even the most sincere, heartfelt \"It'll get better\".","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3s","qSentId": 1906,"question": "\"Hey, maybe you should get help\"","aSentId": 1913,"answer": "To be fair, there are only really 3 choices most mentally ill people have.

Dr. David Mech is one of the world's leading wolf biologists, and a close personal friend of my father's. In several of his books he explores the misconception of the \"alpha wolf.\" When pack dynamics were originally being studied, it was observed that when a group of wolves comes together one wolf will assert it's dominance over the group, sometimes in a violent confrontation, and become the alpha. New wolves introduced to group might try and challenge the alpha, and while I don't know if it has been proven, theoretically a human could go through the same process. A human could theoretically be pretty successful, especially if that human was the one that fed the pack. However, what Dr. Mech eventually realised was that, while all that research was sound, that kind of pack relationship was only ever observed in captive wolves. In captivity, they would bring in a bunch of random wolves, and stick them together, they'd fight, one would be in charge. In the wild, it is far more common for a pack, even a large one, to all be from the same family. With the breeding pair being the parents of all the others, and the de-facto alphas, based only on that relationship. So, while I can't say what the wolves in The Grey would do, since they didn't behave like normal wolves anyway, in the real world killing an alpha will not make you the alpha.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3s","qSentId": 2250,"question": "That's the thing, he didn't just take one wolf with him.

None of which had to do with the lack of action. \nHis character is supposed to know shit about arctic survival and wolves. Apparently no one on the entire production knew anything about wolves or how they behave.\n\n Also he did the complete opposite of what someone who knows what they are doing would do. In the arctic circle, you have basically zero chance of getting rescued if you don't stay by the black box. I don't give a shit if you have a magic watch, it isn't going to broadcast with the same strength as a black box on an airplane. They will be doing a grid search pattern. Moving around and crossing into an area that has already been searched means you aren't getting rescued.\n\n Also the whole decision to go to the woods to escape the wolves. Yeah... Wolves don't live in the woods. As a Canadian with a lot of wilderness experience I was just in awe of how terrible this movie really was. I think the worst part was the shotgun shell spear's though. A fire hardened spear is a great tool in that situation. Shot gun shells going off (not that they would)  would explode in all directions. Likely permanently blinding the user. It would also break the perfectly good spear that would actually do damage to the wolves. Oh god this movie was terrible. \n","aSentId": 3202,"answer": "I really agree with you.

Adding supernatural wolves and acting like they're normal just doesn't make any sense. Again, nothing else in the film is as grossly misrepresented as the wolves. All of what you said is fine and I agree with some of it but I still think it makes more sense for the wolves to represent inner demons because, while other characters are present, none of them experience the same journey as the main character (literally, but also in the growth from wanting to die and then fighting to survive). It's not just about death, but about how the main character's feelings towards death change. \n  \n The point you made actually highlights the problem with the film. Imagery is anything related to sight, touch, taste, smell, or sound. Visually, they look like regular wolves, and none of the other senses are really applicable here. It's their behaviour that's out of sync, so I'm missing the connection to imagery there. I think it's too easy to say \"the wolves represent death\" simply because they're vicious and they kill. I mean, they literally kill everything in sight, there's not much subtlety there to reinforce some deeper metaphor.

At times he makes you think that his character (Riggan Thomson) is a hack and is clearly out of his league with the whole play, and then later in the film he's incredibly powerful delivering it, which gives his whole self indulent persona a weird sort of validity. \n\nBut, Keaton's was my favorite performance of the year.

But sticking with that train of thought, because it struck a chord, let's take Triumph of the Will, a Nazi propaganda film, and compare it to the Transformers franchise. Triumph of the Will was dull, dreary and a deliberate attempt to brainwash people to subscribing to its political agenda. It was commissioned by Adolf Hitler and one of the three highest grossing films of that year in its country. In it you can find bits of \"art\" or technical flair that actually inspired bits of George Lucas' great original Star Wars and more obviously Alan Parker's The Wall. This movie is a \"great achievement,\" hailed by everyone from Hitler to Ebert. To me it's an obvious ploy that becomes monotonous in its simpleminded endeavors. To give any sort of credit to the splendid cinematography that is displayed very rarely in its entire 2hr runtime is to, metaphorically, be digging in the dumpster for a piece of pie.  \n\nAnd so I can say all the same things about Transformers. Honestly I find it disgusting with its blatant product placement and its lust over young female leads. In the last installment the whole second half took place in China (if I remember? Sorry if it was Japan), in an effort to promote overseas commercialism. For all of the polish and finesse of some of the tracking sequences he can't frame a shot or hold a frame for that matter in some of the more demanding action sequences. Not that he doesn't know how, but because for some reason his style has become so diluted as to maintain that equation of shaky cam plus loud noises equals epic experience, which it does nowadays in Hollywood. I see it as an expression of lazy film making. And it doesn't have to be that way. The Rock was a classic 90s action film that had plot &amp; character development and stunning action sequences with little CGI and a lot of practical effects. Even the first Transformers, for what it was, it wasn't diabolical. But the sequels have continuously devolved and become worse.\n\nAnd yes, these movies hurt people. Look at Shia LeBeouf &amp; Megan Fox. Just look at them. Poor souls. But they're not who I'm really talking about. I'm talking about the audience and the industry. If Michael Bay can literally just re use the same shot multiple times in different places of the film, and then re re use those shots in the sequel, it dumbs down film making as an art, as a job, as a whole. I know movies are meant to make money, but when that's the main objective and true creativity is put on the back burner society and the love of film will suffer. It doesn't give any new reason for aspiring cinema students to become great, if great is just mediocre. This fact makes me physically ill, it hurts me. \n\nAnd I know that maybe this is blown way out of proportion, and I've got my biases, and it's not the Holocaust, but this is the best way I can explain it. If you admit that this film is pure evil then I'll admit it has a bit of artistic integrity. Until then it's just as tainted as Triumph as the Will or Rosemary's Baby is to me. And that's all I'll say. \n\nSorry if you took this as a troll.

He's an acclaimed DoP with a knack for producing beautiful, raw images. The stylization of his work is more in the line of a John Toll or Dion Beebe. A very unpretentious visual style that lends itself to a variety of genres, from war film, to comic book movie, to monster epic.\nNow to characterize Joss Whedon as a \"90's tv director\" is doing him a disservice. His previous film, Serenity, is a gorgeous looking film with a very sure hand behind the camera. Jack Green (longtime collaborator with Clint Eastwood), shot the film and it looks as visually energetic and vivid as any modern action blockbuster.\nHis work with McGarvey on The Avengers is appropriate to the tone and style of the film. Very bold, simple frames to emulate the style of a comic book. A clean, saturated colour palette with lots of primary colours - greens, blues and reds especially.

It is set during a war, but there are no battle scenes and no real gunfights (the tavern fight only lasted 5 seconds). The Basterds are not even real soldiers, they are insurgents who ambush and kill in the shadows. And Shosanna is on a personal mission of revenge. Col. Hans Landa never leads his men in glorious battle, he orders the murder of unarmed Jews, hunts his enemies like a detective, chokes an inured woman in an office, and eventually betrays his own F\u00fchrer. The only time we see legendary sniper Fredrick Zoller do his thing is in an over the top propaganda film that is so ridiculous that it ends up funny, even Hitler laughs at it! The entire movie Zoller is perusing his love interest like a charming school boy, until he kills her in *revenge*.  If it's one thing its a revenge movie that uses the Second World War as its backdrop, with military characters to support it.\n\nJust look at the movie Fury (which also happens to have Brad Pitt in it), The Longest Day, Saving Private Ryan, or even Kelly's Heroes; those are all real war movies, the war matters to the story, the war is the story (with the partial exception of Kelly's Heroes). In Inglourious Basterds, the WWII combat is completely irrelevant to the story.

The show admittedly got off to a really rough start but it's improved by leaps and bounds, and has easily become one of my favorite shows on TV. Season 2 especially has been incredible. It's been bold and far more ambiguous than before, well plotted and full of fantastic performances (Kyle MacLachlan is fantastic and deserved an Emmy for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series). \n\nThere's nothing inherently wrong with a 22 episode season either. Shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Veronica Mars thrived on the format. Some of their best episodes are the filler episodes, which were often used as ways to explore characters, themes, or the world in a way that doesn't fit within main arc. Hell filler could even be important, in Veronica Mars 'filler' episodes often got into and explored the social and economical divide in Neptune (the town the show takes place in) which is an aspect that provides a lot of conflict within the show. Filler can still be entertaining and engaging television when it has something to say, most shows unfortunately just use it as bland padding to take up time. \n\nI don't think it's that the 22 episode season no longer works, but I think the climate of TV watching has changed over the years. We've changed as viewers. Nowadays people want immediate payoff with their shows and because of that the 8-13 episode seasons work best. That wouldn't be a problem if:\n\n1. Networks accommodated a new model now that viewing habits have changed. However pretty much every network is still committed to the 22 episode season. This wouldn't even be a problem if it weren't for number 2.\n\n2. Showrunners try to stretch a single arc out over the length of 22 episodes and pad the space with filler (generally the bad kind).\n\n\nAgents of SHIELD has taken a wonderful approach to the 22 episode structure and I think they've shown that it still works. The showrunners broke Season 2 into two halves with two arcs. The first 10 episodes of the season tells a story from beginning to end and it could almost be treated as its own season.

The show admittedly got off to a really rough start but it's improved by leaps and bounds, and has easily become one of my favorite shows on TV. Season 2 especially has been incredible. It's been bold and far more ambiguous than before, well plotted and full of fantastic performances (Kyle MacLachlan is fantastic and deserved an Emmy for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series). \n\nThere's nothing inherently wrong with a 22 episode season either. Shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Veronica Mars thrived on the format. Some of their best episodes are the filler episodes, which were often used as ways to explore characters, themes, or the world in a way that doesn't fit within main arc. Hell filler could even be important, in Veronica Mars 'filler' episodes often got into and explored the social and economical divide in Neptune (the town the show takes place in) which is an aspect that provides a lot of conflict within the show. Filler can still be entertaining and engaging television when it has something to say, most shows unfortunately just use it as bland padding to take up time. \n\nI don't think it's that the 22 episode season no longer works, but I think the climate of TV watching has changed over the years. We've changed as viewers. Nowadays people want immediate payoff with their shows and because of that the 8-13 episode seasons work best. That wouldn't be a problem if:\n\n1. Networks accommodated a new model now that viewing habits have changed. However pretty much every network is still committed to the 22 episode season. This wouldn't even be a problem if it weren't for number 2.\n\n2. Showrunners try to stretch a single arc out over the length of 22 episodes and pad the space with filler (generally the bad kind).\n\n\nAgents of SHIELD has taken a wonderful approach to the 22 episode structure and I think they've shown that it still works. The showrunners broke Season 2 into two halves with two arcs. The first 10 episodes of the season tells a story from beginning to end and it could almost be treated as its own season. But at the same time it's contributing to a bigger picture they have going on and laid the groundwork for the back half of the season. Even though the first arc has come to an end, there are still plot threads and character arcs that they've only begun to explore that will likely play out into the second half. This is the way to do a 22 episode season. 1 season broken into 2 arcs unified by numerous recurring plot elements and character arcs all while contributing to a big picture.","aSentId": 7977,"answer": "No haha the point of my criticism for those shows was limited location. Once you realise they keep going back to or reusing and redressing the same location for budgeting reasons it really ruins the viewing experience. For me anyway, made me appreciate movies and get why they use so much money on locations. It really can enhance a production. \n\nAlso no haha by filler episodes I don't really mean specific character focus/driven episodes. I mean I get those can be fillers but those I normally regard as different beasts entirely and I like them by and large when they're done well, especially since a lot of them were written with purpose, so if it's done well you wouldn't really regard it as filler, it is technically advancing the plot by showing character growth/development.\n\nFiller for me is just the average to bad episodes where nothing happened. Sure they can be villain of the week episodes, or sure they can be the character focus ones, I just class filler as \"if I skipped this episode, I'd have lost nothing\".\n\nI haven't watched Agents of Shield season 2, I'll maybe check it out when the seasons over but honestly they lost me completely with season 1 and all that Skye stuff. If I check it out and it's still \"Skye is the most important person in the world\"/\"We're a family dammit\" then nah, I'm gonna quit again. But that's a personal criticism anyway, \n\nAs for a more objective opinion I can't find you pointing out two shows that use 22 episodes well (and thats arguable, there are a lot of terrible Buffy episodes) as proof of it working. It just really can't man, for one thing it uses up the budget that could be spent on better locations/better CGI/more freaking actors on the more important episodes that actually tell the story. Also there's no way they can work on, review and perfect 22 scripts in the time allotted mid-season, it's how shit episodes get through, cause they're just like fuck it, we need to fill it somehow, just include an important story revelation or worse an important story relevation tease at the end and voila, people now have to tune back in next week. \n\nSecond of all from the story point of view, unless someone did actually write a story that unravelled over the 22 episodes, like the plan was always to tell it over 22 episodes, then no matter what way you look at it 22 just cannot work for telling a story. It just can't, unless it was structured as that from the get go, which sadly most shows really aren't. \n\nThird of all what you described isn't an argument for a 22 episode season working, if anything it's a detractor. It says no it really can't work so instead we'll have an 11 episode season followed by another 11 episode season, without a year long break. I mean you say there's still plot threads and character arcs left over but that's just what a normal show does in general with seasons. And still, no, even the writers themselves would tell you they'd rather have a quick succinct coherent 8-13 episode season to tell a story than have to stretch it out over 22. I mean yeah sure they get paid more for the 22 and increases their chances of syndication but alas the craft suffers for it. \n","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3s","qSentId": 7970,"question": "Not quite film, but Jesus did television get awful. I think you guys call it network tv (UK dude here) but the shows like Agents of SHIELD, Arrow, Justified etc...\n\nI noticed the limited locations, the locations that they constantly re-use (Arrow: alley, warehouse, mansion, office, highway, forest), the locations that they dress up differently but it's still obviously the same location, it really really makes a show feel shitty and makes me appreciate movies more and foreign market shows like The Bridge etc. which foray out. Also the constantly thrown in fight/shootout scenes.\n\nBudget also becomes more glaringly obvious with the non-speaking extras. Once you know they have to pay them extra and register them and all once they speak a single word you notice just how many don't speak at all, and that generic laugh and standing around awkwardly thing they do, Disney shows are ridiculously guilty of this.\n\nI really now hate 22 episode shows as I now get how much of that shit is filler and how hard it is to write one episode, let alone 22, over the course of a year. Someone's going to ham it in along the way, and by God they do. Also newfound respect for the actors and especially the crew who have to do those days. I mean yeah the steady work is great but Jesus that doesn't look easy.\n\nI'm perfectly happy with anyone stabbing James Spader after I heard he demanded the writers rewrite the end of an episode and change an entire story-arc. Fuck that guy and everything about him. Considering A) they don't film television episodes chronologically, they put episodes into blocks and so can film 1,5,9,13 back to back before they film 2,6,10,14 back to back, so when he demands a change and the writers have to alter some shit, that fucks up everyone, all across the board. First the rewrite then some reshoots argh just seriously all the other writers, actors, directors, crew, budget for future episodes. Everyone. Fucked.\n\nAs for film, the main thing was writing. Dialogue and....I don't wanna say cliched, but recurring or obvious plot points or genre conventions just make films bleh to me now. I always guess outloud what a character's going to say next and because of set up and payoff, you can quite easily guess where a character's arc is going and what swerve they're gonna try. I remember during Skyfall, after that hack from inside the building scene just before they do the traincrash bit, I turned to my friend and loudly exclaimed that M was gonna die and Ralph was gonna be the new M, because they kept setting him up as the bad guy boss which immediately meant he was going to end as an ally in the end. \n\nThe problem is I can now tell exactly how someone wrote a film, I can sit and go 'Yerp I can see the words being put on paper' or how they wrote that plotpoint etc, or when they obviously put in a line of dialogue to inform the audience, that pisses me off ff it's done unnaturally like the \"I too am a daughter of Thanos\". So it becomes a treat when they swerve it or the film is so good that I'm too immersed in it and don't care. Or if I just genuinely cannot tell how they wrote that. A great example is The Wire, I'll be fucked if I can ever wrap my head around how David Simon wrote the dialogue for the Wire, it's just magnificent, that was capturing real life. Everything else feels written to an extent, some like great writing, some not so much. But the Wire, nah, that was real life.\n\nBut in terms of film, without a doubt, Casablanca. I can't believe they wrote that before 1942. I mean I've run into more witty films since then (To Catch A Thief, hollaaa) but seriously that one was the first, whoa, that is genius and somehow still feels fresh.\n\nThe Thing (1982) became my favourite horror film and one of the very few horrors I enjoy because I can't guess what's going to happen next, it genuinely had me on the edge of my seat. I love the feeling I got from watching that.\n\nI got to see The Shining again and this time in a cinema. Hated it the first time, didn't even get how it was meant to be a horror film. Saw it in the cinema, fully understood why people went gaga over it, it's so good just to look at for the framing alone but everything about it just flows right as a film.","aSentId": 7979,"answer": "When do you think TV was good? \n\nI think there's a lot of network crap as always, but there have been several shows in the past 10 years that are the pinnacle of the medium.
