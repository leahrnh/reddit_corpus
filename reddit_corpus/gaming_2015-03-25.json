This basically consigned the expansions to the dustbin, for while there were some feeble efforts to produce these expansions, there was no credible commitment on the part of the new owners to do so.\n\nJSA was so upset about this change that they offered all their purchasers full credit in exchange if they wanted to return their purchases.
