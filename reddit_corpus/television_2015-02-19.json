There's just lore upon lore, all of it comes up organically, and none of it feels excessive or tiresome. \n\nThat said, I'm really enjoying a lot of things in both of these series, even though like I mentioned there's an occasional dumb or out of place subplot (\"Beer Bad\" *shudder*). Besides its tremendous world-building efforts, the characters are really what shine in these series. The *Buffy* main cast is just stellar, filled with fascinating and layered characters. I also thought Angel was pretty one-note at the start of *Buffy*, but he's turned out to be a great lead in his own series, with a strong cast of his own.\n\nI saw an impressive episode yesterday that really proves why *Angel* stands on its own, \"I Will Remember You.\" Even though I was never too keen on the Buffy/Angel relationship and it did rely heavily on a Buffy guest appearance, this episode hinged heavily on Angel and proved what a compelling character he can be. I was legitimately affected by the outcome of this episode. \n\nAnyway, I've really picked up steam now on finishing the series since I got to the point where *Angel* starts. Watching the two shows in tandem is a very rewarding experience. I'm one and a half episodes away from \"Hush\", which I've heard tremendous things about.
