You can show any reasonably intelligent person who doesn't know how to program the code for printing 1 to 100, give them the constraints, and they will likely be able to make the change needed fairly easy (How can I make this number go up instead of down!? *Gasp* Subtraction!).\n\nI do agree the author seems to be quite an asshole though.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2fwo", "qSentId": 64285, "question": "This is the perfect example of an interview question that only exists to make the interviewer feel really clever and smug about himself.\n\n&gt; Print 100 to 1.\n\n&gt; That's it.\n\nExcept that's not it.\n\n&gt; The Catch?\n\n&gt; You need to start with \"for(int i=0;\" and continue from there - you cannot write anything before \"for(int i=0;\" and you can't use two loops.\n\nOh, so there's A Catch. My god, even the phrasing is meant to turn the focus on the question instead of on the answer. I feel like I'm watching the interviewer masturbating in textual form.\n\nThe whole setup is laid out so that there's only One Good Answer and the interviewer can pinch you around about how dumb you are for not reading his mind. Otherwise, there would be no need to restrict the question like that in the first place. \n\nThe question also starts with the assumption that you're comfortable with some unspecified C-style syntax language with no type inference. The amount of off-by-one errors you can create on this test, especially under interview conditions, is staggering. If 82% of interviewees \"had to be corrected\" (for fuck's sake, I can sense the fedora from here) during your test, that means your test is a shitty test and you're a jerk. Stop blogging about how dumb everyone but you is and get your shit together.\n\nFurthermore, all of this could be acceptable if it actually helped weed out bad programmers. But it won't. It will, at most, weed non-programmers, as well as lots of good programmers not willing to put up with your shit. All this tests is that the user is able to reason by heart about off-by-one errors and convoluted loops no one would actually write in that way.\n\nWant to make a good test? Take this question, remove the stupid predefined limitations, maybe make it so that you ask for a function instead of for printing (you don't want I/O weirdness interfering with actual algorithm thinking) and, overall, use it as a jumpstart point to have an actual conversation with the person you're interviewing. The trick is to treat interviewees as human beings instead of as elements on some abstract map-reduce candidate processing pipeline.\n\nValid answers to the test:\n\n- \"Well, this would be `for i in range(100, 0, -1): print i;` on Python, right? Wrap that on a def and you're done. I would also write a short test to ensure the first and last numbers are 100 and 1, which is not obvious from the function definition since `range` excludes the last number.\"\n\n- \"`let downwardsCount = [100, 99..1]` on Haskell. Since this doesn't take any arguments, QuickCheck doesn't really make sense for this.\"\n\n- \"Well, I would create a DecrementingNumberFactory class that provides me with sequential numbers which I can later log with log4j.\"\n\nNotice that, no matter if the answer is good or terrible, you don't have the need to correct them so that they can see how very clever you are and how well your parents spent their university fund so that you could learn how to be an unbearable prick on some decadent frat house or whatever. Your job is not to *teach* them. Your job is not to show off. Your job is to *test* them.\n\nThe above answers tell me if I should hire or not hire a person. The following ones, on the other hand, don't. We want to engineer our test so that we get more of the former and less of the latter:\n\n- \"I don't know. I've never written loops that can only increment on one direction before. This is tricky.\"\n\n- \"What the fuck is wrong with you?

As some other comment said, programming is not a performance act.\n\n* The attitude is terrible. Phrases like \"needing to be corrected\" imply that the focus is not on evaluating the interviewee, but in proving the superiority of the interviewer. It's really easy to do an \"almost correct\" solution with an off-by-one error, such as `for(int i=0; i&lt;=100; i++) printf(\"%d\", i)`, which would dump you in the 82% pile of pompously corrected peasants, yet says nothing about your programming ability.\n\n* The test doesn't actually tell you anything about whether or not the programmer is a good programmer.

I can solve this tests in correct ways that prove I'm a terrible programmer, yet that doesn't seem to be taken into account.\n\n* Interview conditions make it pretty hard to actually get a hang of someone's ability; having them write code on a sheet of paper doesn't usually make it any better.

Using FizzBuzz as an example, I know of people who would code solutions like:\n\n----Solution 1----\n\nif (i%5==0 &amp;&amp; i%3==0) {...}\n\nif (i%5==0 &amp;&amp; i%3 &gt;0) {...}\n\nif (i%5&gt;0 &amp;&amp; i%3==0) {...}\n\nif (i%5&gt;0 &amp;&amp; i%3&gt;0) {...}\n\n----Solution 2----\n\nCreate three other counters which reset when they reach 3, 5, and 15....\n\n----Solution 3----\n\nLiterally hard code the entire result set...\n", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2fwo", "qSentId": 64779, "question": "for (int i=0; i&lt; 1; i++){\n  print(\"100 to 1\");\n}\n\nthis, i think, is one of those bullshit interview questions that has nothing to do with programming.\n\nyou've got someone keyed up for an interview.  they need a job.  they've got bills.  maybe a mortgage.  maybe kids.  they need health insurance.  maybe their's is the sole income.\n\nand the author hits them with a question that deliberately leads them in a weird direction AND THEN he's got the balls to say they aren't smart enough.\n\ntell ya what, wise ass author of the article.  you get in debt or need a massive car repair or get behind on your bills AFTER losing a job AND THEN try to solve this.\n\na better interview is to put someone in a faux team setting and have them work to solve a real problem encountered in your business.\n\nbut that would prevent you from feeling so smug, wouldn't it?", "aSentId": 64816, "answer": "oh come the fuck on.

Been programming Java for 15 years. Here's what my days look like.\n\nI start by finding out what emergency's there are and drive whatever is the SNAFU of the day until we can get the customer back in business. Most often the SNAFU is due to running out of disk space, time being off on some servers or routes being gone. Rarely its an application bug, which I like, because I know how to fix those. Our \"support\" is incapable of detecting the most basic problems so its left to me because no one else seems to be able to do it. \n\nOur pipeline is so terrible that a pretty egregious bug that we know how to fix cant get deployed because we diverged the code base so drastically that we can't do a hot fix.\n\nAfter that the junior staff has questions about working with databases . They don't know about normalization or join tables so there is some explanation and background required. I feel its my responsibility to teach them as much as I can. So after going through all the issues with relational databases I also speak on schema free databases, what they are good for, where they fall down.\n\nThe next part of my day is project management. Currently for 4 different customers we are trying to drive through some software and there are a lot of moving pieces. While we do have program managers for every customer, you need a lot of technical understanding to drive the effort. Its one thing to tell the program manager we need a new java keystore with the right key and certificate and the technical know how to actually drive that through. \n\nThen I get to write some code (at this point I'm sort of exhausted) but I plow on. What I'm currently working on is trying to get an integration between our hosted software and a very big company's one off solution. There are not a lot of hints for doing this, so I spend a lot of time reading source code and trying to figure out a \"good\" way to do it rather than hacking things together. In the end, if I do my job right, it will hopefully be only a few lines of code different from what we normally do for integrations.\n\nSo to answer why programmers cant program maybe the answer is because there really aren't a lot of opportunities for guys like me to practice your stupid FizzBuzz questions that are frankly insulting. \n\nWhen I'm sitting there being interviewed, I'm asking you what your pipeline looks like, what your infrastructure looks like, who runs your infrastructure and what technologies you use and why. I have no expectations that your bullshit is any different than any other bullshit out there so I'm looking for something subjectively interesting about you. Asking me FizzBuzz questions reflects more on you than it does me and I have walked out of interviews because I don't like wasting time. \n\nFor example, after one interview where there were already so many red flags about a terrible infrastructure and coding practices and being grilled on how to iterate over lists without using Java collections, they were ready to go over my ability to develop train scheduling algorithms. I asked them, if in their business, they ever had to schedule trains. They said no and I excused myself, thanking them for their time. \n\nThere is another side to this picture. I'm frankly not practiced on stupid interview questions and sometimes I may jump through your hoop and sometimes I wont. But when your infrastructure dies I can help, when you have a customer that has nothing anyone has every seen, I can do a custom integration that gets you that sale. And I can build CRUD apps for you if that's what you really really want, but I'm sick of building CRUD apps for your [shitty dashboard](http://attackwithnumbers.com/the-laws-of-shitty-dashboard) and I'll prefer to do it the way that's easiest for me rather than your obsession with latest tools for making CRUD apps.

The nature of the world we live in is that universities do not make good programmers.  Actual programming is still a cottage industry.   \n\nSo what goes on in universities?   \n\nAcademia is very concerned with teaching you theory.  They want you to understand every aspect of computing from a mathematical vantage point.   With a 'computer science' degree you can explain  \"P=NP\"  to anyone even while talking in your sleep.  But you can't even write the most trivial of algorithms, (eg breaking a sentence into tokens separated by whitespace.)\n\nIn the 1990s I went a university where I was being pressured from all sides to take \"computer science\" through the College of Engineering, not through the College of Arts&amp;Sciences.  The reason was because engineers study how to build a computer starting from raw material up to transistors and circuit design. There was an already-existing (entrenched) program in universities for teaching about computer hardware.  Instructors and colleagues alike pressured me to be an electrical engineer. I resisted.\n\nTo be honest I didn't learn any programming in a university classroom. I already knew C before I even took my first course. When I eventually took classes for \"C language\" I breezed through them and aced them.  My capacities as a programmer were not reflected in my GPA.
