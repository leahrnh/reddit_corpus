Between the Note 4 and the Droid Turbo, I'd say that you should pick between which feature is most important to you: battery life or expandable storage.\n\nOn a separate note, I feel like I should warn you about this. Smartphones have changed a lot and evolved since the iPhone 4S came out; nowadays, most phones are made to last you less than 5 years, whether they're Androids or iPhones. Any phone will likely stop receiving official software updates after about 3 years, and the hardware will usually start to deteriorate after 2-3 years, running slower and slower. Most phone manufacturers now put out a new device every year, so that when you feel your device is getting slower or outdated (which usually starts happening around the 1.5-2 year mark), you'll go out and get a new phone with a new multi-year plan. No matter how top-of-the-line your device is when you get it, there'll always be something better coming out just around the corner.

What I am saying is that Linux is used all over the place for servers and embedded systems, and Linux knowledge is inherently useful. Knowledge of the Linux architecture, file system, and so on is inherently valuable even if you don't know any programming languages. So is knowledge of the coreutils, gcc, vi, and so on.\n\nI also think that Linux rewards experimentation and computer knowledge more than Windows. On Linux, someone who likes and studies computers can change practically anything. Someone can change their window manager, for example, which I am not sure is possible on Windows. That freedom is rewarding and I think it encourages learning. Giving a child a Raspberry Pi and encouraging them to modify it as they see fit would be a great learning experience, and not really possible on Windows with the restrictive licenses and more limited tools. When my daughter got her first computer she installed a different distro every week before settling on Mint, which is the kind of experience you couldn't possibly get on Windows. She was thrilled with the idea that she could make her computer do whatever she wanted. I had to bail her out whenever she broke something (which happened frequently), but she learned and had fun doing it. Compare that to most children who don't realize that it's possible to put something other than Windows on a non-Apple PC or OS X on a Mac.\n\nSo the point is not that children can learn programming.

Those usually use a Mediatek SoC and come with WiFi, Bluetooth connectivity and a USB host port.  \n  \nSince Intel makes mobile x86 and x64 SoCs (used in tablets, phones and the new macbook) I assume it will use a similar SoC. It will be able to run 'full' x86 (maybe also x64) programs because it also runs a x86 (or x64) version of Windows, not the less capable Windows RT for ARM.  \nBut those Intel SoC are low power and low performance. Coupled with only 1-2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage and a mobile GPU, you don't want to use heavy programs, like Photoshop, video editing tools, 3D tools (CAD, 3D modelling) or a big IDE (eclipse or so). They might run, but performance will be bad.  \n  \nThose devices are suitable for web browsing, some office stuff and light programs. I think you could do some simple programming on them (Javascript and html), maybe even some simple graphic editing/design. They might be able to run lighter games (2D games or old 3D games), but nothing new and fancy. There are capable emulators (SNES, N64, PS1, PS2...) for Android (and mobile SoC), so those devices might be powerful enough to run an emulator for an older gaming console.  \n  \nI think those devices are useful either as some kind of smart TV device or when, for example, visiting your parents and you know you have work to do on a computer, but you don't need to bring a laptop and you don't want/can use your parent's computer for it.
