The cast is top-notch, as is the direction, cinematography and set design. It feels rich and authentic enough to keep me engaged. \n\nNow, I'm *all for* slow-paced and slow-burning. I love a character drama that offers little to no plot (as long as the acting is there). The pace of this show is quite relaxing and enthralling all at once. I enjoy watching the family dynamics. That's all good and well. However, the slow-burn 'mystery' feels heavy handed - I'm too aware of the writing. Damages did the same thing, but the hook worked for me as it felt at home as the show was a more 'trashy' (I don't mean that in a bad way). \n\nIn Bloodline, the painfully drawn-out closet of skeletons feels out of place. I find my self-thinking, \"Just tell me or don't tell me, but get on with it already!\". The characters talk around 'the secret' in a way that feels completely unnatural. The way the show doles out its single story 'treat' per episode feels too deliberate and pulls me out of the story. \n\nBasically, it worked in Damages, but seems unnecessary here. I think the show would have been much stronger without the device - just tell us a story of a complicated family in Florida. The cast alone is enough to sell that. We don't need the heavy-handed plot device. \n\nThat said, I'm actually going to go watch episode 7 now, and will most likely enjoy 90% of it.
