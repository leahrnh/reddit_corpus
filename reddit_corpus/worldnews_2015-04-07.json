It's reddit, you'll get upvoted, everyone will believe that random guys who have to make due with little have some kind of magic... \n\n1)-  Assembly writing is great, but it doesn't fundamentally change what you can do.  Specifically, it doesn't give you a single bit of extra permission that you don't have in any other compiled language.  If you have a computer science optimized type of problem and you implement in assembly, you didn't change what you could or could not do.  \n2)-  If you are running the attacker's code (especially their machine code), it's good bet you're fucked already. Doesn't matter what they compiled it under or assembled it with.  This class of exploits is \"privilege escalation\", and it's pretty common to find exploits like this.  It also has nothing to do with assembly language.  Importantly, these are reported and solved pretty commonly by security researchers.  \n3)-  There's not some giant set of problems solved much faster in assembly than compiled languages (hardly even even moreso than interpreted language).  The speed up of writing to the metal is extraordinarily rarely relevant.  When it is, it's usually something like game code or low latency trading.  \n4)-  Optimizing compilers can often do things that assembly coders can't or won't (unrolling five thousand lines of loop).  They also can update for each target hardware.  \n\nThe best CS is found in the developed westernized world.  So are the best programmers, hackers, and so are the best assembly coders.  \n\nEverything about your post is fucking bullshit, from the start to the bottom, head to toe. \n\nPost links to some of this magical fucking .asm files, or stop spewing bullshit on a website that upvotes the fantastic and ignores the realistic.

You absolutely cannot condemn a nation with unsustainable debt for centuries. That's why debt reliefs exist. Greece's economy graphs today show that Greece has been in a war! That's how tragic the situation is. And the irony is that Germany of all nations insists on repaying a debt that cannot be paid!

You just can't have such a small, inconsistent resource like that as your only option for money, especially in the EU. If that's the case then I can totally see why your economy has suffered. It doesn't help that the image the rest of the world has had of you for awhile has been Golden Dawn, economic depression, and rioting. \n\nTie a weak economy to international markets and you're going to have a bad time. The US recession affected the entire world, but that's the risk of tying markets so closely. Other countries have come out fairly unscathed by the recession, like Germany and China (who might be doing better now as a result of the recession) because they had the economic strength and stability to handle it. When you have a weak economy, political unrest and violence, and tie that to an international trade confederation, ie the EU, you really have no insurance against the risks of joining a supranational state. \n\nThe EU bailed you out, but it was already weak from the Recession itself. You government agreed to pay that money back, and it's not as if there are real reprucussions for not paying back an economy you belong to right away. \n\nThe fact is Greece is doing better, but it needs to get its shit together as far as the new government goes. No one owes Greece anything at this point, and it needs to address the needs of it's citizens for once and it's economy now more than ever, rather than having pissing matches with people that already helped it once. Now they are adding insult to injury by demanding Germany pay WWII reparations that they have already finished paying out, not to mention most people still alive that were affected by WWII are dead or elderly. It's certainly not an attempt to improve negotiations and is simply more of the same narrative: putting the blame on others when Greece should have acted with deliberation and sense when it made its decisions. WWII has zero to do with Greece today and the whole thing is not very becoming of a democratic country, especially to the one country that has kept the EU strong.\n\nYou need to stop thinking that the world is against you; we are against a government that has consistently made poor, selfish decisions at the cost of it's people and stability. We\nare against a government that has driven Greece into the ground, and there's no point in making the distinction between new and old at this point. I don't want to hear about neo nazis in your parliament and rioting in your cities, or your supposedly liberal government refusing to be a part of the confederacy it joined. It's sad. I don't want to hear about how poor your country has been and how bad things have been, and how many people have been absolutely fucked over by the actions of asshole politicians in your country for the past 7 years or so. \n\nIf Greece wants to survive, it needs to begin deficit spending and enacting reforms to help the lower and middle classes, not doing whatever the fuck it is now - especially not playing games with superpowers like the EU/Germany and Russia. The last thing the world needs is a new Russian protectorate and Greece leaving the European sphere. \n\nThe EU is something I'm not totally decided on. I think it might be better for Greece to stay and begin diversifying it's economy and doing some spending. I don't see things going well for either entity if Greece leaves, though. The EU would lose some stability, but I think would survive. Greece in the other hand, is really depending on Europe at this point, and I'm not sure political differences are worth severing that lifeline.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13", "qSentId": 50695, "question": "don\u00b4t get mad for all that irony and sarcasm! i\u00b4m a german citizen and i feel with you! i\u00b4m currently unemployed, but recently wrote my phd-thesis in history. along the way i worked three years as a mortician. so i don\u00b4t think i\u00b4m the average german. but me and the people i know (inb4 dead people) know all for true, that the actual crisis is not the fault of a mysterious actor called \"the greek people\". you are in deep shit because you got under the wheels of history. but these wheels are driven in this shit by a network of powerfull, very cynical people, who are german and greek and murrican and russian and so on. personally i don\u00b4t blame \"the greek\" but this network. if the german media tells that \"the greek\" is lazy, they search for a scapegoat... and they put pressure onto the german people as well for beeing more effective.. that\u00b4s my opinion.", "aSentId": 50696, "answer": "You do not know how much it means to me to hear this from a German.

In this way the institutions and major countries that back the euro can come out relatively untouched, as it was clearly failures on a personnel level rather than institutional frailties.\n\nThe currency would suffer a hit, but without the anchor of Greek debt and repayment worries, and backed by Germany's massive manufacturing and trade base, would bounce back to health in a  relatively short time.\n\nOh, and they will never make Greece as important as Israel on the world stage, primarily because wether Greece is safe and well supported or not is not a key election issue in the USA, but a safe and well supported Israel *is* a key election issue in the USA.

Chinese tourists are terrible but they are only acting like they act in their own country, disrespectful to everyone around them, spitting and pushing in line and not giving a single fuck about anyone around them. A good example is that if a chinese person sees you running for an elavator they will either ignore you press the close door button. Another is any bus where people push to get on before people get off and often old women are left having to get off at the wrong stop.  Some of it is cultural, some of it is because a lot of chinese are a generation away from the life of a medieval peasant, most of it though is the complete destruction of common decency from years of revolution and backwards communism.\n\nThere will be a few people who disagree with me but they will have either never been to China or like me live here and are still in their patronising \"They are a developing country\" phase that fits in with their western political ideals. The Truth is that most people who have lived here long enough outside of Shanghai or HK will say the exact same thing, Chinese people don't know how to behave in public. Strangely a lot of Chinese will agree as well particularly those who have lived in the west.  \n\nThe other side to all this is how Chinese people are treated like cattle by tour providers. It's pretty disgusting and makes me angry to see this. They are overcharged to get whistle stop tours of places taken from site to site then to a cheap chinese restaurant in the middle of nowhere. There are even separate dining rooms in hotels because the owners don't want the Chinese annoying the other guests. Europe and SE Asia want Chinese tourism money but they don't want to Chinese, and that seems unfair. \n\n\nIt's a chicken and egg situation, are they treated like that because they can't behave well? or do they behave like that because they never really have to engage with people and cultures different from their own? The more China engages with the outside world the better it will be but they will only get a chance to when they move away from these stupid tours and have to deal with real people in other countries. The thing is nearly all of these tour providers are chinese owned by people who want to make a quick buck. Customer service isn't really a thing over here and good luck if you want to make a complaint. \n\n**TL;DR Chinese people can't behave in public, but it's also bad that they are treated like cattle by tour operators.**\n\n*Bonus fun story, I was in the Terracotta Army museum recently and I saw the \"Customer Comments box\" which is the first I've seen in China.

Saying it's the country's culture is pretty much not saying anything at all. Taiwanese culture is based on identical values and traditions, they only branched out in the past 60 years; yet they are much better received internationally. Even South Korea, and to a lesser extent, Japan, have a large chunk of their culture rooted in the same values, and you don't see people hating on them as much. Taiwan, SK, and Japan actually also went through similar stages of development and exponential growth, but mostly in the 70s~early 90s. Had international traveling been as developed and easily accessible back then as it is today, you might also see similar \"hate\" towards them. But fortunately, that wasn't the case back then, and they had enough \"buffer\" time for the general population to become more educated on social etiquette. \n\nAnother part of this that makes the Chinese really stand out is the legacy of the Cultural Revolution. There are actually great discussions on this issue within China currently, as more and more younger generations are getting terribly annoyed by the mid-aged and senior groups that always act poorly towards others and make everyone's life miserable. \n\nBut why the mid-aged and seniors? Well, during the cultural revolution, extreme selfish actions are often necessary for someone to climb higher in the social ladder or even just to survive, and ignorance was highly praised over education. People who did survive that time period, and especially those who had a good life in that time period, are forever left with the idea and attitude that \"selfish action brings rewards\". Today, majority of the mid-aged to senior population are survivors w/ this bad mental frame. They are also the generation that has gotten mega-rich in the past decade or so, and therefore the ones traveling around, leaving bad impression. \n\nNow, of course there are also younger people that also act poorly. They are, after all, raised by the messed up generation(s) before them. But, as the country develop, and more and more of these young people are able to learn and experience more about the world, the general trend will slowly shift towards a positive direction. As I said in the previous comment, in the next decade or so these type of education will catch up because of the country's development and things should get better, just like it did in Taiwan, SK, Japan, HK, etc. ", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13", "qSentId": 52723, "question": "\u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\u6211\u7231\u4f60\u548c\u4f60\u7684\u56fd\u5bb6 \u5b83\u975e\u5e38\u597d \u4f46\u662f\u9700\u8981\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u52a0\u548c\u8c10\n\n:\"Chinese people I love you and your country is very good but it needs to become more harmonious\"\n\nHow good was google translate ?", "aSentId": 52724, "answer": "Pretty fucking well", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13", "qSentId": 52723, "question": "\u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\u6211\u7231\u4f60\u548c\u4f60\u7684\u56fd\u5bb6 \u5b83\u975e\u5e38\u597d \u4f46\u662f\u9700\u8981\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u52a0\u548c\u8c10\n\n:\"Chinese people I love you and your country is very good but it needs to become more harmonious\"\n\nHow good was google translate ?", "aSentId": 52726, "answer": "I think the last sentence translates more to \"your country needs to change more and become harmonious \", but that's minor\n\nThe effective, simple grammar that is taught to Chinese as a foreign language students works particularly well with Google translate.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13", "qSentId": 52723, "question": "\u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\u6211\u7231\u4f60\u548c\u4f60\u7684\u56fd\u5bb6 \u5b83\u975e\u5e38\u597d \u4f46\u662f\u9700\u8981\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u52a0\u548c\u8c10\n\n:\"Chinese people I love you and your country is very good but it needs to become more harmonious\"\n\nHow good was google translate ?", "aSentId": 52728, "answer": "Somtingwong", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13", "qSentId": 52730, "question": "Look, not all Chinese are like this, I am myself one and I certainly consider all the symptoms you described as disgusting.

Saudi officials have been privately critical of the congressional prohibitions and appear to prefer to avoid contentious public debate over U.S. foreign assistance, arms sales, and security cooperation. The Saudi-funded nature of the U.S. training reflects Saudi Arabia\u2019s ability to pay for the costly programs.
