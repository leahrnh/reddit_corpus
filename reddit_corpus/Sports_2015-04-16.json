Because of this they're typically in a lower classification (although they still beat everyone in 6A that they play) which makes it easier to be dominant. A lot of people accuse them of recruitment but who knows if they do or not. They also work insanely hard. I played for an extremely dedicated and time consuming team, but the stuff we did is peanuts compared what we've heard from their players. Where on a school holiday my team would maybe get a workout and film session from 8:15-11:30 am, they apparently have had days where they were practicing/working out/watching film from 6:00 am-1 pm. One example of their discipline: they have a team policy where everyone on the game film has to stay inside the field of view of the camera. The team does 10 up-downs for every person that didn't keep up with the play in the camera's view and as a result the team once did over 220 up-downs in a row. I think they work out the day after games too, and all of that's just some of the stuff they do that 99% of teams don't.\n\nTL;DR they're stacked with talent and have great coaches, and the way they do enrollment makes it easy for people to keep transferring in and to stay in lower classifications.
