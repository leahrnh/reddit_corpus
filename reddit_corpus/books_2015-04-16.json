I have a memory of being maybe 2 or 3 where I was sitting on his lap and he read me Curious George. \nCoincidentally it was one of his favorites growing up too. My favorite was Corduroy.

You mean the tarnished, purple-dyed, millimeter-wide edge of every page? Edges of the page that contained no dictionary words or anything of (sentimental) value? Who cares? Any rational person can understand that these \"destructive\" techniques were necessary to repair the book. And, again, it wasn't a \"restoration\" as other people have called it, but a repair. This isn't some priceless antique that needs a restoration, but an actual usable item that simply could not be usable without a repair. The fact that the binding and cover needed to be replaced is proof at how extensive this book was in disrepair. If the binding is loose and the glue stale, the pages of the book starts falling out. And you can't have a book if you have a pile of loose sheets of paper. And if you're going to replace the binding, the cover needs to be replaced as well since both the binding and cover in these types of books is a single set piece.\n\nAgain, you're analogies aren't applicable here. The head and the handle of an axe comprise the entire axe, you're forgetting that a dictionary, or a book for that matter, is primarily comprised of words on a page and a dictionary is valued for those words. Not the binding, the cover, or even the tiny, purple-stained, hairlength edge of every page. No, it's more fitting of an analogy if you said the handle was replaced because it was cracked in half and the head of the axe sharpened because it was dull, which again, any grandson should be fine with if they intend to use the axe.\n\nAnd more to the point, if you intend to use an aging, dull axe with a handle cracked in half what would you to, ahem, as you put it, *restore* it without being \"destructive\"?

Some of the later stories do indeed have weird fiction undertones, the degree to which they manifest differs though. The second half is not as esteemed because it does not have as much bearing on the history of fiction as the first few stories do, but I still think they are excellent stories and deserve as much attention as the first half of the book.

My first publishing contract came at 19 which I cancelled, subsequently destroying the book. Somewhere along the way I forgot why I ever started writing.

At this point I've managed to jot down so many story notes my shirt pocket is loaded with post-its. I grab food at a Mexican cart or the 76 or some Chinese takeout. Then I sit down and catch up with John Oliver or Stewart or Walking Dead or Better Call Saul or Mad Men (thanks, AMC!) or some Mario 64. And I jerk around on Reddit. I call the fianc\u00e9e who lives long distance. And I start writing around 8pm or 9. I'll get a few thousand words in then go to bed and reddit some more.

Statistics can be easily manipulated to demonstrate pretty much anything you want them to, so you must always be careful in your use of them. Pundits and politicians are in my experience always heavily biased towards their particular side, but you do have rare exceptions that can be surprising looks not only into various schools of thought, but the workings of politics and the delicate dances and sacrifices that must always be made. Those are the stories that intrigue me and I tend to always stay away from extreme pundits and politicians that will do anything to push their agenda. I've had to \"unspin\" candidates and pundits before to see where their true motives lie, and it's tedious, jading, and extremely annoying when you have to shovel through all the nonsense they spew. \n\nThese days, if I read political books, I tend to go for memoirs that focus on the person's time in office or in the press and how that affected their views of life and politics. It shows the other side of the curtain, and if they've already fulfilled their political obligations they are freer to share things that their party may not agree with. Biographies are also a good source, especially after the person they covered is deceased and more issues can be talked about. I also find political books from countries outside of the United States to be refreshing and interesting because they either have a) multiple political parties which gives an interesting look at how other countries may benefit/not benefit at having multiple prominent political parties, or b) have different political systems which have one or no party, and if these systems are effective with certain issues and how events have shaped those systems for better or for worse.  \n\nNo political book will ever be perfect, but if you learn to unspin them and see the true motives, pretty much any political book (*sigh*, maybe even the pundits) can become interesting.
