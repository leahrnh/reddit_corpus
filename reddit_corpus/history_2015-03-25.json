The resources expended to keep the camps running (rolling stock particularly) could have been far better used transporting troops or materiale as opposed to people for extermination. The guards working the camps could have likewise been put into front line service. Don't forget, in the middle of 1944, with the war going incredibly poorly, significant rolling stock was allocated not to moving troops to the western or eastern Fronts, but to moving ~400,000 Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz for extermination. Strategically speaking, that is a horrible use of logistic capacity, add to that the fact that most of these 400,000 were put to death shortly after arrival, and the economic return is negative. Granted, this is just one example, but also consider that if the camps had been producing anything of real war importance, the western Allies would not have hesitated to bomb them (as they did all other German war industry). And before anyone disputes it, the British and Americans knew about the camps as early as 1942, and by 1944 had confirmation from numerous sources of their existence (see Auschwitz Protocol).", "aSentId": 60329, "answer": "Death means that they no longer have to be fed, sheltered or require medical attention.
