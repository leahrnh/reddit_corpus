The device is being pitched as a way to remove blood via micro capillaries without using a needle in a vein. The main reason to extract blood is for testing. Using micro capillaries with vacuum force will very likely result in shredded red blood cells. The contents of red blood cells stains the serum (non cell part of blood) red. Many laboratory analyzers will reject these samples because the hemolysis (broken red blood cells) interfere with the way analyzers read the concentrations of various tests. In the chemistry department of a hospital it is very common for analyzers to be using spectrographic (how much color is produced or how much light can pass through) methods.

This isn't going to work. I've been asked more times than I can count if my Moto 360 is an apple watch. When i say no it's a Moto 360, they have no idea what I'm talking about, a lot of these people being android users. I ask if they've heard of the g watch, the Gear watch or even the pebble. I have yet to have anyone hear if any of those. It's evident in sales too, android wear is really underwhelming at under 1m units of all combined android wear devices. They're already priced from really cheap to right around the cost of the apple watch. The apple watch preorder estimates are at 2.3m in just weeks. There many reasons for this i feel. One is android may hold a ton of market share but it's held in very low income countries, which buy sub $100 phones meaning a watch is a crazy luxury. Apple caters to the high end market who can afford a smartwatch. Apple also advertises leaps and bounds over android as a whole. Also I feel if someone bought a first gen android wear device or even one now, there's not much use case for them, they're sort of buggy and you see things like \"android wear is not responding and needs to close\". This is unacceptable on a end user level. I think apple has a much more finished product as they normally do. They're very careful about releasing half baked features where as Google isn't and a lot of times said features aren't very good and the user experience suffers. Apple also has the retail outlets with personal try ons and demos. I hate to say it but apple is doing it right and is the reason why their product sales continue to grow and same with their market cap. People buy what works and what works well and in most cases that's apple. The warranty is excellent and is available at any Apple Store which is nice. \n\nBtw I've used a ton of android devices probably 15 different flagships and maybe 3 tablets.

First by establishing a quality baseline to compete against, and second by opening people's eyes.\n\nFor android users like me, seeing all this apple watch hype has me inches away from pulling the trigger on another device. People who are jealous of their friends' new apple watch now have the motivation and desire to buy something. \n\nPeople who balk at the idea of an apple watch with less than day's battery life will see things like the Pebble which are already established, and maybe they'll be willing to give up some features in order to have their device work for a week. \n\nSo yeah, there have been a lot of half baked or half assed products out there, but with apple blowing the market open and making people take smart watches seriously, I think the end result is gonna be more amazing products for everybody.

I usually pack my phone up into my seat bag or pannier bags before leaving, then when I'm ready to start I just say to my watch \"OK Google, start a bike ride\" and it starts tracking. It's nice. A few times I've gotten lost while on a bike ride, no need to stop and get out my phone and look up directions, just \"OK Google, Navigate to ____\". So yeah I'm hooked on the smart watches now...

Wallet creates a virtual card that all your transactions are sent through so they see all transactions for *every* card.\n\nI'll illustrate.  If you use a different physical card at 3 different stores:\n\n    Store 1 &lt;--&gt; Card A  \n    Store 2 &lt;--&gt; Card B  \n    Store 3 &lt;--&gt; Card C  \n\nGoogle Wallet:\n\n    Store 1 &lt;-\\              /-&gt; Card A\n    Store 2 &lt;--*-&gt; Google &lt;-*--&gt; Card B\n    Store 3 &lt;-/              \\-&gt; Card C\n\nApple Pay:\n\n    Store 1 &lt;---&gt; one-time token &lt;---&gt; Card A\n    Store 2 &lt;---&gt; one-time token &lt;---&gt; Card B\n    Store 3 &lt;---&gt; one-time token &lt;---&gt; Card C\n\nPrivacy-minded people aren't going to use Google Wallet for obvious reasons.  Credit card companies don't like it because they don't as much information.  And merchants don't like it because they still have to process CC info for the virtual card, which means there's still incentive for their systems to be hacked.  Some consumers don't like it because they don't get store-specific card benefits (because the CC company doesn't get the store info).\n\nEven *Google* isn't totally behind it because they pay a second transaction fee on every charge, the cost to get all your transaction info, which they have to recoup somehow (get ready to press skip on a 15 second ad when paying for your coffee).\n\nIn contrast, with Apple Pay, stores like that the one-time token can't be reused so there's no reason to hack the store and no liability.  Apple is fully behind it because they get paid to provide the system.  Privacy-minded people like it because Apple doesn't get any of their purchase info, only the stores and card provider know the details.  Consumers still get store-specific card benefits.\n\nIt's like Wallet is lose-lose-lose for everybody... even Google has to pay to get your transaction info.  And Apple Pay is win-win-win.

However, it wasn't until apple pay came out that Google wallet got all kinds of new upgrades and is now insure by the FDIC or will be if I'm not mistaken. \n\nYES, I do realize that Android wear hit the market first. But again, not alot of hype and still alot of issues to be handled. \n\nI also COMPLETELY agree that apple hasn't done anything advancing with the iPhones, yet they have alot of consumers see them as doing a lot of good things. \n\nI Lastly also understand marketing but it's not just about marketing. Google makes these major advances but seems to sort of half ass it and not really commit to it. Good example is Google wallet. They used NFC and had pay options quite some time ago, but it wasn't fully developed. Since the announcement of apple pay, there have been numerous advancements to that service that probably should have been done long ago, yet they wait till apple does their thing before taking the necessary steps.\n\nAll I'm saying is that I think Google should commit better to their innovations. Yes they may seem strange to the consumer at first but the more you put into it and the more mainstream it becomes, the more receptive society is to those changes.
