The empire, after all, had been split into multiple administrative divisions since Diocletian in 285 AD, after it became clear that it was too large to be effectively ruled by a single individual.\n\nWhile popular history largely ignores Byzantium, in truth the \"Roman Empire\" continued to flourish there until the Ottoman conquest in the 14th century. Indeed, even after the western empire had collapsed it remained a vassal state of Byzantium for centuries. Culturally, Byzantium adopted little from Macedonia.
