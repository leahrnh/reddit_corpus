That gave me about an 80\" display with \"good enough when the lights are off at night\" quality for big screen movie watching.\n\n\nMy new apartment has a four foot longer bedroom and my cheapie projector doesn't have zoom, so a shelf over my bed would make the screen bigger than my wall. Plus the opposite wall has a window on it, so that reduces how much can be used for a projector screen. I can't ceiling-mount the projector either because the entire \"prime real estate\" for mounting it is blocked by a ceiling fan.\n\n\nThree options: 1: Replace the projector with a short-throw projector. Problem: Have yet to find the quality/brightness at my preferred price point. 2: Replace the projector with a long-throw, zoom, or home theater projector. Difficulty: I want to stick to LED lighting and not hot/expensive-to-replace DLP projector lamps - especially since those hot bulbs make a lot of fan noise. 3: Install a regular LCD big-screen TV in the bedroom. My living room TV is only 40 inches, but 55+ inch 1080p TVs are getting competitive especially since I won't be going to 4k any time soon because I don't buy any 4k content. Watching old X-Files episodes on Netflix does not need a 4k TV, but I want something BIG for when I experience new movies for the first time at home. Difficulty: Do I really want a massive TV dominating part of my bedroom wall? The cool part about the projector was that it did not LOOK like it took over the room.\n\n$500-$750 ideal budget. I'd need a screen, too, since the only screen I own is an \"outdoor\" screen over 100 inches - too big with the frame - and the walls are too far off \"white.\"  I already own the sound bar, Apple TV, Steam machine and cables I'd need including ceiling mounting hardware.", "aSentId": 35690, "answer": "I'd go with the TV, and here's why:\n\n1) you're not going to find a solution that also works with your lighting conditions\n\n2) I have one of these projectors - they are big, loud, and hot (even with the fan running). Not the best thing to put above your bed (IMO). You'll be fighting the whir of the fan over the audio every time you turn it on.\n\n3) Best option. No noise from a fan. No need to purchase a screen.

Cobalt oxide battery chemistry has great energy density and better voltage for running peripheral electronics like LED's without the need for voltage step-up circuits.  They aren't going to pick 3.3v variety of Lithium cells like LiFePO4 specifically because of the inferior energy density + increased weight, even if it results in 2000+ cycle life that would actually reasonably allow an internal battery.  So, instead of putting in a *replaceable* energy dense LiCoO2 cell, they fucked everything up by putting in one that requires special tools and training to replace it when it is *going* to need replacing a few years down the line with regular use.  Apple got away with this (for a number of reasons I will not get into), and Samsung now wants to capitalize on this business model hoping they wont lose the market base of intelligent consumers who are aware of this.
