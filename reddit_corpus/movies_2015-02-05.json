In fact they told me the entire plot of the movie, but when someone tells you the story it doesn't sound scary at all. It sounds cool, even for a 7 year old.\n\nBeing the movie lover that I am, I begged my parents to rent it so I can watch it. Not knowing what it is about, just that it is \"about ghosts\" they eventually got it and I sat down to watch it at my grandma's house.\n\nI no longer remember how long into the movie did I last before I ran screaming away from the living room, into the kitchen where my grandma was chopping whole chickens with a clever to make dinner, which escalated further the terror in my mushy young brain.\n\nI don't know exactly how or why, but my brain was rewired. That movie scared me so deeply that I did not sleep for nearly 2 months straight other than at some pockets of time out of sheer exhaustion. I would scream and cry endlessly if I were to be left alone and or in the dark. Here are just some of the effects (none of which existed prior to this event) this had on me for years to come:\n\nAbsolute fear of the dark. I had to sleep with the light on. Could not go outside at night. The front bumper and headlights of cars would look like faces and scare me.\nAny loud or sudden noises would scare me, even ones I know very well and knew could do me no harm. I would keep the bathroom door open so I could flush and run quickly when I am done because the sound of flushing would scare me so much.\nI had nothing but extreme nightmares.\nMovies that I have already watched before and loved, would now scare the shit out of me, like ghostbusters and little shop of horrors.\nI felt paralyzed by life.\n\nThis was the most horrific and debilitating experience of my life, and these conditions did not go away until I was 15 when I sick of being like this, a teenager who is scared of the dark etc', and decided I had to do something. With determination and time I eventually managed to completely get over this (which is a whole story on it's own), although who knows what unconscious stuff still remains from this thing. The day I was able to go back and watch this film and enjoy it was one of the satisfying I've ever had.\n\nNot sure why I'm telling you this. I guess the moral of the story is don't let you kids see scary movies no matter how much they beg, it is one hell of a trauma. Scary movies from the 80's don't even begin to compare to the horror that Hollywood has produced these days. Poltergeist is child's play compared to The Ring or Saw (hell Child's Play is child's play compared to these).\n\nedit: **TLDR** -  Poltergeist has traumatized me as a child, all better now, don't let your kids watch scary movies.

He lay upside down with the air-bags deployed when he heard a voice which he described as \u201ccalming and beautiful.\u201d This serene voice belonged to Werner Herzog who had coincidentally been driving behind Phoenix\u2019s car and had witnessed the crash. When Phoenix tried to light a cigarette, Herzog with his soft German intonation, simply said \u201cman relax.\u201d Although Phoenix replied calmly that he was relaxed, Herzog told him \u201cNo you\u2019re not.\u201d If you\u2019re ever in a similar situation with Werner Herzog then you should most definitely listen to what he says. What Joaquin Phoenix hadn\u2019t realised was that there was petrol leaking from the car. But Werner Herzog saw it. He sees everything.

Imagine for a second that you're carrying a backpack. I want you to feel the straps on your shoulders. Feel 'em? Now I want you to pack it with all the stuff that you have in your life. You start with the little things. The things on shelves and in drawers, the knick-knacks, the collectibles. Feel the weight as that adds up. Then you start adding larger stuff, clothes, table-top appliances, lamps, linens, your TV.\n\nThe backpack should be getting pretty heavy now. And you go bigger. Your couch, bed, your kitchen table. Stuff it all in there. Your car, get it in there. Your home, whether it's a studio APARTMENT or a two bedroom house. I want you to stuff it all into that backpack. Now try to walk. It's kind of hard, isn't it? This is what we do to ourselves on a daily basis. We weigh ourselves down until we can't even move. And make no mistake, moving is living.\n\nNow, I'm gonna set that backpack on fire. What do you want to take out of it? What do you want to take out of it? Photos? Photos are for people who can't remember. Drink some ginkgo and let the photos burn. In fact, let everything burn and imagine waking up tomorrow with nothing. It's kind of exhilarating, isn't it?\n\nNow, this is gonna be a little difficult, so stay with me. You have a new backpack. Only this time, I want you to fill it with people. Start with casual acquaintances, friends of friends, folks around the office, and then you move into the people that you trust with your most intimate secrets. Your cousins, your aunts, your uncles, your brothers, your sisters, your parents and finally your husband, your wife, your boyfriend or your girlfriend.\n\nYou get them into that backpack. And don't worry. I'm not gonna ask you to light it on fire. Feel the weight of that bag. Make no mistake - your relationships are the heaviest components in your life. Do you feel the straps cutting into your shoulders?\n\nAll those negotiations and arguments, and secrets and compromises. You don't need to carry all that weight. Why don't you set that bag down? Some animals were meant to carry each other, to live symbiotically for a lifetime - star crossed lovers, monogamous swans. We are not those animals. The slower we move, the faster we die. We are not swans. We're sharks.","aSentId": 4946,"answer": "It's a pretty good speech, but the message of the movie is that this is not a good way to live.

If you want to be a cinematographer, it's very useful to remember this key point:  The \"best\" cinematography always means the *most appropriate* cinematography.  \n\nBeauty isn't always the goal --and is often at odds with the \"meaning\" of a given scene.  When watching movies, try to see what is being conveyed visually that equates to \"the physical/experiential\" that well serves the narrative, the movie's themes, or the best sense of place or the subjective \"feelings/observations/thoughts\" of the characters.  You'll quickly realize that the \"point\" of great cinematography is usually not about gorgeous images, but about...um...engorged \"tactility\" or intentional \"distancing\" to provide a measured observational stance.  Ground yourself in an understanding of Film Language (and its long codified syntax) *first* --especially the correct usage of all \"tenses\" of P.O.V.

Really all so that DC could replace him with a hip young new green Lantern, kyle Raynor. It's er but my phone decided that's how it's gonna spell it so there we go. Anyway kyle becomes green Lantern and takes over for hal, and it turns out hal was actually under mind control from an evil... I guess spirit demon, so he's not really a bad guy. Mostly this was just because people didn't like hal being a mass murderer so DC retconned it. It's unlikely we'll ever see kyle as a green Lantern in a film franchise as a LOT of history has to pass with hal first, though it's not impossible. \n\nAlso somewhere along the way this guy Jon Stewart and guy Gardner became lanterns. \n\nSo hal was brought back and now there are four separate lanterns running around doing Lantern stuff. We'll almost definitely never see job Stewart or guy Gardner as lanterns in a film franchise, except maybe as cameos. \n\nBasically what you need to know is hal Jordan is classic modern green Lantern and, although kyle has his supporters, hal is the most popular and most likely to ever be in the movies.

The actors were allowed to play around in rehearsal (before filming obviously) and this allowed actors to contribute new lines not in the script - with approval, of course, for inclusion in the final cut.  For a $200M+ film, this is practically unheard of.  Especially for the actors.  A lot of the movie's quotable lines and exchanges are in fact products of what I just described.\n\nJeff Bridges makes clear in several interviews they were NOT making it up as they went along, contrary to popular opinion.  They added more to the script during the rehearsal process and seeing what would stick.  This is NOT common for big-budget films - he described it as \"almost like a $200M student film.\"  The bigger the budget, the less freedom the actors get - there's just too much money at risk.\n\nThe ones that make things up on the fly are incredibly sloppy.  Pirates 3 is the most egregious example... but the movie was going to make a shit-ton of money anyway so the risk was minimal.  Iron Man was NOT a sure thing at the time - and no studio would ever allow that movie to shoot without (at the least) a working script.  As the flagship of that movie, it needed a solid framework.  Can you imagine if Fellowship of the Ring was a sloppy godawful mess - New Line Cinemas would have taken a huge financial bath on the disasters of the following two movies.  Sequels to bombs NEVER do well - or get made in the first place.\n\nEDIT:  Same thing with The Big Lebowski, despite its much, much smlaler budget.  Every last \"um\" \"uh\" and other related stammering by the Dude was written WORD FOR WORD in the script.  People who say it's improvised on the spot have no concept of the time (and money!) to be lost if films were not planned out as much possible far in advance.

I remember refreshing /b/ all afternoon with the hope that someone would make a new meme. I was a memer back when Advice Dog was the only one and I still upvote every Advice Dog meme I see becasue of the fond rush of nostalgia it brings me. Nowadays, there are many thousand on quickmeme and other meme websites. I was a memer back before memegenerator was created (the first meme website) and I had to make them with MS Powerpoint or Paint. Speaking of meme websites, I was one of the first submitters to memebase.com and still have one of the top accounts there despite having migrated to reddit nearly 2 years ago. It was on 4chan and memebase where I cut my teeth creating memes, way before I had a reddit account and way before /r/adviceanimals[1] was created in late 2010. Back before I could get any sort of points or even username recognition, I was creating memes as a clever and easily digestible way to reflect on society, relate some story to my audience, or just be funny.\n\nDo you remember rich raven? No? I do. You probably don't remember depression dog, crazy girlfriend praying mantis, introspective pug, or friendzone Johnny either. I remember all of them.

It's her brother Lionel's. When Suzie brings it on the trip with Sam, she brings with her a French record (her favorite), from her grandmother/aunt (I can't remember which). It's significant that it's her favorite, possibly since it seems to be the only thing that is given to her by her family that she acknowledges, and given her history of theft and disconnect from her relations and from society, she probably values that very highly. I think it's  also a reference to the French New Wave, that Wes Anderson was influenced by.\n\nPeter/Francis/J. L. W.'s Belt: I think this one is closer to just an overall mood highlighted by the physical object. It could be a symbol of their father's love/approval, and Francis feels threatened that Peter thinks he is more deserving  of the belt (and the keys, and the razor, and the glasses, and the luggage) than he is. But it could also just be an illustration of the squabbling that grief has created between the brothers.\n\nMy two cents","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3s","qSentId": 7698,"question": "\u2018I\u2019m Not the Fox I Used to Be\u2019: Wes Anderson\u2019s Changing Seasons","aSentId": 7705,"answer": "Just made a great film even better.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3s","qSentId": 7698,"question": "\u2018I\u2019m Not the Fox I Used to Be\u2019: Wes Anderson\u2019s Changing Seasons","aSentId": 7707,"answer": "I wish this were legible.
