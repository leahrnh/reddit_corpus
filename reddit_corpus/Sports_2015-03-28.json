I played baseball and golf as well, but I also was wrestled for years and I can say that the mentality of mutual respect when it comes to good sparring tends to be much higher. The mentality of \"just win\" comes with many of the introductory levels of sports like baseball, golf, etc. But when it comes to sparring/MMA/wrestling, even random guys you might run across a couple of times (like a couple of sectional or regional matches) you'll have a much different rapport with, and some of the new people you end up matched up against. The kid I won my first ever match against was so tore up about it, so I went over and hung with him for the rest of the day (this was a regional thing, so basically all day), explained to him that it all comes in time, etc.\n\nThis whole mentality of \"hatred for the enemy\" only comes with certain individuals, and they don't belong in MMA/combat sports. That anger does nothing but cause problems in the ring. In the \"normal\" sports you see in high school like basketball, football, etc. a MUCH higher value is put on \"winning\", much of this being the fault of coaching. But, since it's not a combat sport, I think it's much more allowable in some people's eyes, being that it's not quite as brutal.\n\nMuch of the gyms and people who fight aren't you're average \"football level douche\" type and they're just great people. In MMA/combat-related sports, you tend to realize veryone started somewhere and you lose matches, etc. That's just the way it is. Whereas for many other sports, you might just end up \"joining up with a winning team\".
