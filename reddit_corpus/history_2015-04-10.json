Although we take many/most of our words from them, English syntax, grammar, and \"philosophy\" are far more influenced by French than anything else. An easy example is in how we pluralise words, we add an s, but in old English, there were (I think) four possible plural endings: e, en, er, and s. In this case it was actually the Vikings who made it less Germanic, simplifying the endings to make English easier. The more important part is in our syntax. German (which I use as an example of because it's the only non-English Germanic language that I have any speaking knowledge of) uses cases to change the purpose of a word/sentence. They change the article of the noun to alter it's meaning. In English and French, we use verb tense to change the purpose of a word/sentence, hence the abundance of tenses in each (as well as there being effectively only one case in each). Our syntax is also French-based, we understand our sentences by the subject, and aside from adjective placement and some articles, use the exact same syntax as French. German is verb focused, and sentences follow the verb accordingly, the conjugated verb in an independent clause always being second and in a dependent clause always being last. In addition to this, Germanic influence on English has been declining ever since William the Conquerer, we even used to have a dative case (who vs whom). French is a far greater influence on modern English than Old Saxon.\n\n                                                              /rant\n\nEdit: please correct me on any misinformation/wrongness", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh53", "qSentId": 66413, "question": "I strongly disagree with the top comment.

He was killed in the Battle of The Thames. During negotiations for the Treaty of Ghent which ended the war, the British first demanded a neutral \"buffer\" native american state that would've effectively blocked westward expansion. American delegates refused, and the British didn't get their buffer state in the final negotiations.\n\nFlorida was a bit of an indirect gain. The Creek War is usually considered part of the War of 1812, due to them taking place at the same time, and the Red Sticks seeking help from the British (and helping the British during Admiral Cochrane's Invasion). Jackson fought the Red Sticks, a traditionalist faction of the Creek, and defeated them at the Battle of Horseshoe bend - forcing them to cede some 23 million acres of land in Southern Georgia and central Alabama. A little while after the war, Jackson invades Florida (then Spanish) to effectively demonstrate that Spain can't hope to control the area with such a small armed force. Spain sold Florida the next year.\n\nWhile not *officially* ending impressment, due to the war against Napoleon being mostly won, the British rescinded the orders in council that led to the impressment of Americans.
