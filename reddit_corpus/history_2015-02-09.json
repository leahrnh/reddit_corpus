The biggest Star in the accident was an Argentinian Player, Eliseo Mouri\u00f1o, who came frome Boca Juniors (one of the most important soccer teams in South America, maybe the world) he came to Chile to this small club, because he was invited to play in Green cross for a friend who already played there. This friend before the game injured in a game, so he didn't flew with the rest of the team and it supposed that Eliseo wasn't going to travel neither, because he wasn't able to play because he hadn't all the papers signed, but he travelled anyway because the managers of the teams invited him to travel to know the beautiful south of Chile. \n\n\nEdit2: The players and managers of the team flew in two separate flights, one of the people of the Coaching staff insisted in make the travel back in train, but the rest of the team laughed of him.

","aSentId": 46787,"answer": "There is quite a bit of debate on this topic, and depending on who you ask you will get different answers.\n\nTo truly answer this then you need to understand the species debate. This is a bit of a long winded thing, but suffice to say the question is if morphological differences denote a species, or if we should use purely the viable offspring definition. Now, obviously we can only see the morphological differences in fossils; and only know about offspring from the DNA (which shows Europeans have around 7-12% derived from Neanderthals and is believed to be from interbreeding). The issue with all this being that humans and Neanderthal's have been assessed as different enough morphologically to be different species (hence *Homo neanderthalensis*). But genetically having viable offspring (their genetics survive in today's Europeans) would mean they are of the same species and should be *Homo sapiens neanderthalensis*. This classification would muddy quite a lot of paleoanthropological classifications of other hominids as the assessments have, by necessity, being made through the morphological definition.\n\nThen you need to understand that there are different beliefs about human origins, that affect what people will say. There are effectively three theories: Out of Africa, Assimilation, and Multi-regional. \nOut of Africa discusses *Homo sapiens* origin in Africa and then the spread into the rest of the world, replacing (murdering/out competing) all other hominids.\nMulti-regional discusses an early species from Africa (*Homo erectus*) that spread around the world and gradually evolved towards *Homo sapiens* whilst maintaining gene flow through these distinct geographic populations ultimately creating the geographic variation we see in humans today.\nAssimilation is somewhere in between in that *Homo sapiens* originates in Africa and then spread out and through a process of interbreeding produced hybrid species.\n\nBefore we got the genetic evidence the Neanderthals sudden extinction 30 000 years ago was highlighted as evidence that *Homo sapiens* replaced them. \nWith the genetic evidence, and some fossils (the recent Israel mandible, Lagar Velho child) supports hybridisation. There have also been recent studies (my dissertation included) which have indicated that Neanderthals whilst appearing different morphologically, are actually statistically similar to humans.\n\nI'll give you a quick run down of evidence: Humans and Neanderthals certainly coexisted for ~100 000 years; there is arguably evidence of cultural exchange; there is certainly genetic exchange; the Neanderthal morphological form certainly ceased to exist 30 000 years ago.\n\nMy opinion: We were two sub-species *Homo sapiens sapiens* and *Homo sapiens neanderthalensis*. We lived alongside each other exchanging trade etc. Ultimately the Neanderthal culture became untenable (mammoths hunted to extinction? we went to war?) and they went extinct whilst the survivors genes were swamped in humans and the morphological traits faded.\n\nTl;Dr Certainly, there is evidence of human/neanderthal interbreeding and absorption. But the form definitely disappears suddenly ~30 000 years ago.
