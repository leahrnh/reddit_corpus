The harmonium is a cave-dweller. A more gracious creature would be hard to imagine.\" - *A Child's Cyclopedia of Wonders and Things to Do.*\n\n&gt;The planet Mercury sings like a crystal goblet. It sings all the time. One side of Mercury faces the Sun. That side has always faced the Sun. That side is a sea of white-hot dust. The other side faces the nothingness of space eternal. That side has always faced the nothingness of space eternal. That side is a forest of giant blue-white crystals, aching cold. It is the tension between the hot hemisphere of day-without-end and the cold hemisphere of night-without-end that makes Mercury sing.\n\n&gt;Mercury has no atmosphere, so the song it sings is for the sense of touch. The song is a slow one. Mercury will hold a single note in the song for as long as an Earthling millennium. There are those who think that the song was quick, wild, and brilliant once - excruciatingly various. Possibly so.\n\n&gt;There are creatures in the deep caves of Mercury. The song their planet sings is important to them, for the creatures are nourished by vibrations. They feed on mechanical energy.\n\n&gt;The creatures cling to the singing walls of their caves. In that way, they eat the song of Mercury. The caves of Mercury are cozily warm in their depths. The walls of the caves in their depths are phosphorescent. They give off a jonquil-yellow light. The creatures in the caves are translucent. When they cling to the walls, light from the phosphorescent walls comes right through them. The yellow light from the walls, however, is turned, when passed through the bodies of the creatures, to a vivid aquamarine.\n\n&gt;The creatures in the caves look very much like small and spineless kites. They are diamond-shaped, a foot high and eight inches wide when fully mature. They have no more thickness than the skin of a toy balloon. Each creature has four feeble suction cups - one at each of its corners. These cups enable it to creep, something like a measuring worm, and to cling, and to feel out the places where the song of Mercury is best. Having found a place that promises a good meal, the creatures lay themselves against the wall like wet wallpaper. There is no need for a circulatory system in the creatures. They are so thin that life-giving vibrations can make all their cells tingle without intermediaries.\n\n&gt;The creatures do not excrete.\n\n&gt;The creatures reproduce by flaking. The young, when shed by a parent, are indistinguishable from dandruff.\n\n&gt;There is only one sex.\n\n&gt;Every creature simply sheds flakes of his own kind, and his own kind is like everybody else's kind. There is no childhood as such. Flakes begin flaking three Earthling hours after they themselves have been shed. They do not reach maturity, then deteriorate and die. They reach maturity and stay in full bloom, so to speak, for as long as Mercury cares to sing.\n\n&gt;There is no way in which one creature can harm another, and no motive for one's harming another. Hunger, envy, ambition, fear, indignation, religion, and sexual lust are irrelevant and unknown. The creatures have only one sense: touch.\n\n&gt;They have weak powers of telepathy. The messages they are capable of transmitting and receiving are almost as monotonous as the song of Mercury. They have only two possible messages. The first is an automatic response to the second, and the second is an automatic response to the first.\n\n&gt;The first is, \"Here I am, here I am, here I am.\"\n\n&gt;The second is, \"So glad you are, so glad you are, so glad you are.\"\n\n&gt;There is one last characteristic of the creatures that has not been explained on utilitarian grounds: the creatures seem to like to arrange themselves in striking patterns on the phosphorescent walls. Though blind and indifferent to anyone's watching, they often arrange themselves so as to present a regular and dazzling pattern of jonquil-yellow and vivid aquamarine diamonds. The yellow comes from the bare cave walls. The aquamarine is the light of the walls filtered through the bodies of the creatures. Because of their love for music and their willingness to deploy themselves in the service of beauty, the creatures are given a lovely name by Earthlings.\n\n&gt;They are called harmoniums.\n\n--**Sirens of Titan**", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh4i", "qSentId": 8031, "question": "I was fortunate enough to see him speak in 2004.

I have no interest in any other Vonnegut books after that.", "aSentId": 8058, "answer": "For me, realizing that I loved Vonnegut was a lot like realizing I loved The Big Lebowski.  I see so many parallels.  I vividly remember the first time I watched The Big Lebowski.  I was confused.  I had heard on and on about how great it was, how it was the funniest movie my friends had ever seen, how it was a cult classic.  So, I watched it.  And I didn't get it.  I mean, I \"got\" it.  I understood the jokes.  I just didn't think they were that funny.  I didn't think the story made very much sense.  It didn't seem profound, it seemed stupid.\n\nWell, eventually, I watched it again.  And, hmh, what do you know, I found myself laughing out loud a few times.  I started to learn the absurdity of the story was the joke.  I started to understand that the jokes weren't normal jokes with punch lines.  In other words, I was looking in the wrong places for the humor and the message.\n\nAnd then I watched it again, and I couldn't stop laughing.  But the strangest thing is, I didn't know why I couldn't stop laughing.  I didn't exactly get what was so funny\u2014I only knew that something was.\n\nTo date, I've probably seen The Big Lebowski twenty times.  Every time I watch it I notice something that makes it even more hilarious.\n\nVonnegut, like The Big Lebowski, is strange because it's hard to pin down what is so great about it.  I think they're a lot like inside jokes you have with your friends.  They don't make sense from the outside looking in.  They aren't funny.  But once you're in on the joke, it's damn near the funniest thing you've ever watched / read.  So, it's pretty polarizing.  \n\nWith Vonnegut, the characters are secondary to the ideas.  Vonnegut's writing is just commentary on the human condition viewed through the lens of a conventional novel.   If you don\u2019t like social commentary, it probably isn\u2019t for you.  But if you read it like a novel, for the plot, it seems nonsensical--at worst, it seems bad.  But as vehicle to discuss ethics and human nature and poverty and war, there really isn't anyone better.\n\n\"So it goes\" isn't an expression of the character not caring, it is an expression of the frustration one feels when presented with the unfair dilemma that is life.  It's basically positing the questions: \"Is this is?  Is this the best we can do as humans?  Should we accept this?  Or can we do more?  Can we be better to each other?\"  You only get the context of the quote if you read more of his catalogue.  Vonnegut's writing as an exploration of that idea: that bad things happen to good people, and that we should put more effort as a society into being good to one another.\n\nIn closing, I'll leave you with one of my most up-voted comments in my reddit history about what makes The Big Lebowski so great.

I see so many parallels.  I vividly remember the first time I watched The Big Lebowski.  I was confused.  I had heard on and on about how great it was, how it was the funniest movie my friends had ever seen, how it was a cult classic.  So, I watched it.  And I didn't get it.  I mean, I \"got\" it.  I understood the jokes.  I just didn't think they were that funny.  I didn't think the story made very much sense.  It didn't seem profound, it seemed stupid.\n\nWell, eventually, I watched it again.  And, hmh, what do you know, I found myself laughing out loud a few times.  I started to learn the absurdity of the story was the joke.  I started to understand that the jokes weren't normal jokes with punch lines.  In other words, I was looking in the wrong places for the humor and the message.\n\nAnd then I watched it again, and I couldn't stop laughing.  But the strangest thing is, I didn't know why I couldn't stop laughing.  I didn't exactly get what was so funny\u2014I only knew that something was.\n\nTo date, I've probably seen The Big Lebowski twenty times.  Every time I watch it I notice something that makes it even more hilarious.\n\nVonnegut, like The Big Lebowski, is strange because it's hard to pin down what is so great about it.  I think they're a lot like inside jokes you have with your friends.  They don't make sense from the outside looking in.  They aren't funny.  But once you're in on the joke, it's damn near the funniest thing you've ever watched / read.  So, it's pretty polarizing.  \n\nWith Vonnegut, the characters are secondary to the ideas.  Vonnegut's writing is just commentary on the human condition viewed through the lens of a conventional novel.   If you don\u2019t like social commentary, it probably isn\u2019t for you.  But if you read it like a novel, for the plot, it seems nonsensical--at worst, it seems bad.  But as vehicle to discuss ethics and human nature and poverty and war, there really isn't anyone better.\n\n\"So it goes\" isn't an expression of the character not caring, it is an expression of the frustration one feels when presented with the unfair dilemma that is life.  It's basically positing the questions: \"Is this is?  Is this the best we can do as humans?  Should we accept this?  Or can we do more?  Can we be better to each other?\"  You only get the context of the quote if you read more of his catalogue.  Vonnegut's writing as an exploration of that idea: that bad things happen to good people, and that we should put more effort as a society into being good to one another.\n\nIn closing, I'll leave you with one of my most up-voted comments in my reddit history about what makes The Big Lebowski so great.  It applies almost exactly to Vonnegut as well.\n\n\"It's genius because it's so philosophical.
