That doesn't make creationism any more or less true, hence my position that circle jerk concern trolling is usually a distraction from the losing side to move the discussion away from facts into a tone argument. \n\nAlso, ironically the MORE popular a position is, the less likely it is to cause a circle jerk outrage tide. Most of the things I've personally seen people accuse Reddit of circlejerking over are actually quite contentious, such as belief in god or Americans' practise of genital mutilation. In that sense, complaints of circlejerking are actually usually attempts from individuals from a majority culture to suppress a minority opinion, no different from people in a specific Subreddit suppressing information that goes against their community's standards.

This is not really a concern for the Russian state, but is a big concern for Russian companies. \n\nA positive trade balance means more foreign currency is flowing into the country than is leaving. This provides currency for foreign debt service. Otherwise, Russian companies have to buy it with rubles that are worth less and less, hurting their bottom lines worse and worse.\n\nThere is not much short-term danger of a state default because very little Russian sovereign debt is foreign denominated. But if the economy gets worse and worse, it is always possible that the state will lose the ability to easily service the debt with tax income.\n\nWhile this is going on, Russia continues to issue new bonds both to raise needed funds and roll over old debt. These new bonds take into account the large amount of ruble inflation and the growing danger of eventual default, so they are much more expensive to Russia, they carry much higher interest rates (over 13% last time I checked).

With the West's increasing influence in Ukraine and numerous gas pipeline proposals to go through places like Syria and Iraq to get to Turkey and thus to Europe, Russia started working on the South Stream pipeline late 2012 early 2013 and would have bypassed Ukraine by going through the Black Sea to Bulgaria. This was interrupted in 2014 by the events in Ukraine and Russia taking Crimea.

Only when a crisis can diminish the day to day life of Russians will it warrant action.  As long as there is food supply and housing there will be no true cause for action.

Instead of seeing the escort/prostitute as another person willing to provide a service, one might think, \"oh, this women is a degenerate (a whore), why should I care for her well being?\" It's that false moral high ground that people take due to societal pressure which is dictated through the government as being wrong (religious reasons are a part of it, but it's still the government who dictates the idea of it being wrong in this case). As soon as something is labeled illegal, the chances of one who practices in that illegal realm will also do other illegal things is pretty high, due to the fact of the initial response and the idea of getting caught, and mostly shunned by society as a whole.

If I had my choice in providers (I don't due to the sheer nature of legality at this point), and one provided very thorough STD testing and demands condom use for every session, even though it was more expensive, it would be way more desirable for me to use that service instead of the one that is unknown. And don't forget that people still acquire STDs outside of the sex trade, and being STD friendly/STD positive might be desirable in the market as well.\n\nWhen you understand that societal norms are actually created through government force and not the other way around is when you can see the picture clearly.

The British are better than the rest of Europe but there's always the \"outsider\" feel even for those who are 2nd generation. I'm always amazed at how in denial many Europeans are of their colonialist and imperialist history and how detrimental it has been to the rest of the world, and more importantly their inability to take this into account when they start lashing out at immigrants who \"can't assimilate\". The US may be more \"openly\" racist, but Europe is definitely more racist within.

There are no deep-seeded cultural traditions that prevent practicality from being squashed by those said traditions... Also, because NA is so big, if you don't like living w/ other people, you can literally just move away to the middle of fucking nowhere and lead a nice prosperous life made practical by the \"do-it-yourself\" independent mindset culture.

From the outside looking in, this is why many people in my culture (Iran) deep-down view, or at least understand, *why* the US as the #1 in the world: because they work hard. Working in university is seen as a necessity. Working in high school is seen as a very positive thing. No matter how shitty or small the job. Now, is this a good thing?

In Latin, there are tu/vos as second person pronouns, and in the 1100s, monarchs across Europe decided they wanted a more formal pronoun, so they gave vos more power instead of tu. \n\nThis actually crossed over into English because of the Normans, which took Old English thu/ye (which was simply you/y'all to them, no formality intended) and turned them into thou/you (informal/formal). \"God bless ye merry gentlemen\" is older than this, so it literally means \"God bless y'all merry gentlemen.\" \n\nIn English, the informal dropped over time (except for apparently the Quakers) and left us with our only pathetic singular second person pronoun without a plural partner. Gee thanks, French. \n\nIn Spanish, they inherited tu/vos from Latin and they pretty much became interchangeable with time. Note that they both use the standard second person conjugations. Since they are interchangeable, vos+otros has the same formality register as tu. The going thing at the time to express formality was to say \"Your grace\" (vuestra merced), and therefore refer to them in the third person instead of the second, since, you know, you're not really talking to their grace directly. So \"vuestra merced\" became \"usted\" (gub'nah), and still uses the third person, leaving everyone confused. \n\nAnd that's the history of how English and Spanish both said screw you to the T-V distinction, and used their own dang words to express formality.

The guy's obsessed with death. It's become a bit of a running joke among the diplomatic community there that every time he's invited to give a speech he will invariably begin rambling on about death and how it lurks for us all. Essentially, he's an extremely depressing public speaker.\n\n2. He has a fairly archaic world view. What I mean is that everything goes through a very 'proletariat versus bourgeois' world view. He seems to be under the impression that everything will be solved once the class struggle is resolved. Climate change, gender issues, foreign policy, all of this is secondary to the class struggle. Additionally, he's somewhat...sexist? This is understandable considering his age, but regardless, if I recall correctly at a conference for women's rights he began preaching the importance of a women's domestic role over all else. Not exactly very tactful.\n\nApart from these there's the whole education and security issues mentioned in a comment above. Uruguay used to be extremely safe and while it ain't exactly Caracas yet, I recall not feeling safe at night like I used to last time I visited. Not to mention his numerous foreign policy blunders (calling FIFA 'hijos de puta' for banning Suarez is undignified for a head of state), which is embarrassing considering he's supposed to represent the nation. This is all so incredibly frustrating when talking to foreigners because of the impression that he's some kind of paragon of virtue above the filth of politics prevalent  in other countries. Yes, he is extremely humble, and that certainly is something to admire. But he's not infallible, and as someone who dislikes him it's irritating to hear nothing but praise.

Without slavery, the former slaves could live meaningful and productive lives. Without husbandry, cattle don't exist. If abolishing slavery meant killing off all the enslaved, it would be a lot more complex of an issue. May still be the worthwhile thing to do, but that's again because people are different than other animals. If it was possible to have human slaves that were happy and well off, then again, the morality of slavery would be a lot more complex. It isn't though, because people are people, and have desires, and yearnings that animals aren't capable of.\n\nFor example, humans also have the capacity to yearn for freedom in a way that many animals don't. A steer, or a hog, does not yearn to be free. Yes, it needs sufficient space to be comfortable, but freedom for them means death. \n\nA human has the capacity for abstract thought. An animal doesn't. The rules that govern what is \"right\" or \"wrong\" for them are not the same as the rules that govern humanity. For that matter, the rules that govern what's \"right\" or \"wrong\" for a steer are not the same as those that govern say a killer whale. We can't make a general conclusion based on a specific instance, and we certainly can't conclude what's \"right\" for an animal based on what's \"right\" for humanity. \n\nProper husbandry is beneficial to all parties concerned, and that is very much not the case with slavery. One can not practice slavery in such a way that it isn't abusive to the slaves.\n\nAll that said, I don't mean to imply that there aren't good reasons to be vegetarian. There are, and a lot of them (\"I don't like eating meat\" being a particularly excellent one...). I just don't buy the conclusion that vegetarianism is morally or ethically superior, or even \"better\" overall. By all means, choose what you want to eat for yourself. \n\n&gt;...because If I could do it, so can the world.\n\nSorry, but I'm summarily rejecting this argument. I don't think it's remotely fair to draw that conclusion from your experience. Again, I don't think the world should *want* to be vegetarian, but even if we set that as a goal, I don't believe for a second that it is achievable. The human experience is very tied up with our husbandry, and has been since as long as we've really called ourselves human. IMO it's a beautiful and life affirming part of the human experience, or at least it could, and should, be, and that a world with proper husbandry is so very much better off than a world without.\n\nFWIW, I'm actually not a big meat eater. I could do just fine without meat. I'd very much miss my animal fats (especially assuming we're lumping dairy in with \"meat\" (which I think is fair, because it's all the same issues)), but coconut oil is pretty awesome too, and I could get along just fine without my beloved butter and lard. It's a bit odd that I'm in this specific field, because it's really produce that I love, and gets me super excited. I just think that our meat production is one of the more pressing issues of the day, and it's one I've found myself in a position to do my very small part in trying to improve. My only point here is that I personally am not all that attached to eating meat, and that desire is so very low in my reasons for doing what I do.\n\nThough that said, good meat is pretty delicious... I'm not saying that I don't enjoy it, very much so even, just that there are many other things I enjoy, and even more so.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13", "qSentId": 28762, "question": "The unequivocable advantage of vegetarianism requires that we eat non-tillage crops.

You can be either, but not both, to at least maintain a modicum of morality in my opinion. \n\nI would not consider Japan and China quite comparable to most African and Middle-Eastern countries from where refugees come now. Both were able to prosper in a period of peace, lacking internal strife, which is not the case in the Middle-East and Africa, and, perhaps more importantly, both weren't colonised for decades to centuries.
