Our expectations were low, if I'm being honest.  We expected some silly little comedy that would run out of apocalypse jokes six episodes in.  The hour long pilot last week piqued my interest.  I wanted to like Phil Miller, but he is just such a gross jerk!  and Carol Unpronounceable Last Name is daffy but lovable.  They are both childish.  Phil's childishness manifests with his limitless energy and potential for creative destruction and Carol's with her bright eyed optimism and stubborn refusal to fall victim to Phil's anarchism.  \n\nThe second episode is what got to me and changed my opinion of the show. \nSpoilers follow, but hey, it's a sitcom:\n\n In the second episode, Carol has told Phil they are responsible for repopulating the world, but she will only have sex with him if they are married.  Carol sets off to plan her wedding and gives Phil one task: Get the rings.  Which of course, he fails to do.  \n\nAt the appointed time, he arrives at a decorated church in his dirty khaki shorts, tee shirt and track jacket.  Carol is in a lovely gown with a bouquet and has pre-recorded a wedding ceremony on a boom box.  Carol hides her disappointment with Phil's sloppy attire and lack of flowery words, but when they get to the part about the rings and Phil can't produce them, she breaks and runs out of the church.  Phil returns to the house and finds she has decorated the house, baked and decorated some sort of cake made out of god knows what, but decorated like a real wedding cake complete with bride and groom toppers that resemble Carol and Phil.  Phil's even has a bushy beard.  \n\nPhil realizes he has crushed Carol's dream.  And, to be honest, I teared up crying.  She is also the last woman alive  and like every girl, she had dreams of a lovely wedding and a charming groom.  Even if it is pretending, she wanted and worked hard to make the day special and Phil smashed those dreams.  It was heartbreaking to see him realize how badly he hurt her and seeing her sitting alone in the middle of a craft store in her wedding dress among the remains of all her hard work to make the best of the situation around her.  This was a marginally funny, but very poignant episode and frankly, I'm enthralled with where this is going.  \n\nTL; DR - Love Forte and Schaal, love the writing, cried a bit.

To me, it just seems like they are trying to cut into the cake, but they forgot to bake it.  Stories like this need buildup, and unfortunately the writers of Gotham appear to not understand this.  My hope is that it will get better over time, but right now I feel like I could stop watching at any point, and wouldn't miss anything. \n\nEdit:  Also, this is me just being a nitpicky bitch at this point, but does anyone else absolutely hate the art direction of the show?  One thing I loved about the Nolan films was that Gotham felt like a real city, but with this show, everything seems a little surreal, very similar to the Burton and Schumacher films.  It's obviously supposed to take place in a modern time period, but for some reason, everyone is dressed like they are living in the 70's.  Obviously, this is merely a taste thing, but it's just one of many reasons I just do not like the show. ", "aSentId": 23915, "answer": "Have you seen the eyeball scene?

It hits my sweet spot of constantly something happening due to the bad guy of the week, and overarching plots and usually pretty interesting characters. \n\nMy issue is just that its gone on too long. The last few seasons have been okay, but its the same banter over and over, DiNozzo is a good with the ladies, Gibbs is old, Ducky rambles yada yada, its not new or funny and hasn't been in forever. It used to be one of my favourite shows, back when there were story arcs I cared about, the meat puzzle and Ari in early seasons, the directors past in mid seasons, Tony/Zivas thing etc, but with Ziva leaving one season and not wrapping anything up they haven't done anything with the show in such a long time. \n\nIf you like procedurals, NCIS does it the best I'd say. Its got the CSI stuff, but its more quirky than actual CSI, you've got the strange goth girl, the hot woman, the old tough leader, the polar opposite guys, the two ME's etc. It really hits a lot of highs there, but the problem is simply the length. 12 seasons and there has been only 3 cast changes for the main team Kate For Ziva in s2/3 then Ziva for the blonde chick in s10/11. Having the same people on the show breeds staleness.\n\nTL:DR - The show has had the main cast the same for so long, 3 changes of the same character (Ziva/Kate/Blonde Chick) and none of the rest of the team, they added McGee early on as part of the team and since then only the directors have changed. The development of the characters stopped ages ago, there's no relationships or anything to get invested in and the banter got boring about half a dozen seasons in as it never changes and plays on the exact same things.
