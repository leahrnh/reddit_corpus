The scorched doors were a controversial point: there were attempts to stop them by protesters, but the police prevented this from happening. Was it confusion? Was there conspiracy? It wouldn't be the craziest thing to happen in Mexican (or world) politics.\n\nMexico is a funny country, we were able to depose of a de-facto 90 year old dictatorship hidden as a democratic government without a revolution. It's well understood that democracy is not something a government respects, but something that is imposed by the citizens on governments. People are panicking because they think that Mexicans are going to go into revolution, but in reality they were merely reminding the government that it's the citizen's choice who gets to be in power, no matter what any other organism says. The mid-term elections coming up this year will allow the political shift that will, hopefully, balance things enough again. Otherwise a more dramatic political shift will occur in 3 years during presidential elections. Right now there's a strong movement for smaller parties and independent candidates, if politicians care about their system they will cave to the people's desire to avoid such a system to appear.\n\nMexican democracy was built under extreme hardship, the kind the US has not lived. The IFE system was built to allow for full democracy in a system were the president had full control. Things like the Florida controversy in the Bush election do not fly in Mexico and people are more than wary about it: they are downright paranoid. Right two controversies exist:\n\n* You can still (illegally) buy the votes of people by hiding as swag, which is a big issue. Not much has been done over this because this is extremely hard to verify.\n* Locally the power of the IFE at state level varies and some states have been better at corrupting the local organization than others. They are creating a new national organism called the INE, it's controversial if this will be better or not, pros and cons. It's mostly seen as a move from the parties to weaken regulations over them, but the side-effect is that it has given more power to independent candidates.

What you may not have considered is the fact that Bond was shooting in the UK and rewrote the script to take advantage of the new Mexican incentive. In effect, moving a large portion of the production from the UK to Mexico. In retaliation, the UK could have planted the article to apply pressure to the studio to keep the production in the UK and turn away from the Mexican incentive. \n\n", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13", "qSentId": 573, "question": "MM?

Without the major bosses at the top paying all the local underlings with drug proceeds, the underlings take control themselves.  They'll increasingly focus on extorting local business, kidnapping for ransom and end-user dealing.  All of that produces less money and inherently includes more violence.  Combine that with a large number of heavily armed ex-cartel gangsters with few other opportunities, and I could see violence actually increasing.

Circumcision-related mortality rates are not known with certainty; this study estimates the scale of this problem. This study finds that approximately 117 neonatal circumcision-related deaths (9.01/100,000) occur annually in the United States, about 1.3% of male neonatal deaths from all causes. Because infant circumcision is elective, all of these deaths are avoidable.

They did everything they could to assure people could get out alive.  Not everyone did, sadly, but they won't sit idly by.  They were already meeting this week about what to do to stop these very actions.  \n\nThe people here are scared but they're also very strong headed.  When they had their revolution they didn't get the chance to piggy back on a wave of support because others had done it and succeeded.  They were the first to stand up and demand a change.  When that change wasn't what they wanted they stood up yet again and demanded change again.  \n\nIt's not going to be a simple solution and it's not going to come overnight but having lived here for a little bit (July 2014) I've gotten to know a lot of Tunisian people and they won't let their government sit by and let this go unanswered with some sort of action.\n\nMy wife is upset and is telling me that it's bad and believe me, it's bad.  It's bad because they killed tourists and this country thrives on tourists and the terrorists know if they can make this a scary place they can have a foot in the door to take it over.  The government will not just let that happen.\n\nWhen explaining my optimism to my wife I told her that maybe because I'm just desensitized to the whole situation.  Not that the events aren't horrific but I told her \"This is just a mall shooting where I come from.  This is just a theater shooting.  In the US we get this shit on the regular so maybe I just don't grasp how big of a deal it is\".  And maybe I still don't but I know that right now, the Tunisian people are gathering people in the center of the city to  protest/rally against terrorism just as they did in France.\n\nSo can I really say that with confidence after today's events? Yes and I am not just trying to dismiss it.

Even if they wanted to be identified as being part of their host nation, they will almost never be accepted. They will always be identified as being part of where their parents are from not where they lived their entire life. So they are left with only one group for their identity and its their religion. You see this all the time in most immigrant communities, especially if they live in an integrated community, where their \u201cethnic\u201d identity is founded around their religious community. When wars break out in the Middle East, they are narrated as religious struggle, and since these second, third generation kid\u2019s sense of identity is founded on religious community, they feel that they are also an integral part of the religious struggle. Lot of older second/third gen don\u2019t seem to really participate, because they themselves have a new identity based around where they work or their family.

It works as an equalizer...the hard workers work hard, then the government comes in and taxes the fuck out of their income to redistribute to the lesser earners or non-earners. In turn, workers have no incentive to work hard because they can take the handouts and continue to live comfortably, Whether it is out of laziness, resentment, actual ineptitude, physical or mental disability, playing the system, etc...it doesn't matter. The even playing field has effectively removed the reward of hard work. Anybody who has taken a basic economics class can tell you that socialism is an optimistic yet unobtainable dream. I'm not arguing that it *wouldn't* be great if it could work...I'm arguing that it simply *can't* work. \n\nMy problem with it is that if some of the people figure that they don't need to work to get what they need, then the rest of the people realize they aren't going to get what they work for, nobody has any incentive to work hard at all. In order for socialism to work, you need cooperation from everyone within the society, and that's just something that will never happen. Have you ever had to work on a group project and you had a lazy slacker in your group that you and the other members had to pick up the slack for? YOU work extra hard and you all end up getting a good grade, but the lazy slacker received that same good grade and did not learn any sort of lesson. Next group he's in, since it worked out so well for him last time, he's going to pull the same shit. Now imagine trying to do that on a national level, but with a whole shitload of lazy slackers, and this group project never ends. There comes a point in time where the hard workers in the group decide that it's not fair that they work so hard and the slackers get the good grades, so they work a little less hard on the group project. When one person does this, the rest of the \"class\" can pick up the slack, but as more and more people feel as if they're the only ones working hard, they get discouraged, and they too begin to slack.

Customers in the city are typically less informed of how nature works.\n\nThe issues the supermarkets were having with less informed customers were that blemished food would be ignored by customers that would only pick the most visually appealing food because after all, all the produce was the same price. Without continual re-stocking over time this would create food sections that contained a higher percentage of \"blemished\" food than unblemished. This in turn would render a supermarkets fruit and vegetable section less appealing, running the risk of losing customers to competition. As a result supermarkets took a more pro-active appraoch to filtering food. If one supermarket does this and attracts more customers then all the local supermarkets follow suit. They make more money pre-emptively filtering blemished produce from reached the store than selling it and risking bothering uninformed customers.\n\nIn the US it's reached the point that large supermarket conglomerates have taken the strategies that worked elsewhere to their smaller market locations, but my experience in other places in Europe was the further you get from cities, the more informed the customers were about what produce was OK/not OK and the less likely that visually \"unappealing\" product would be filtered out.\n\nHowever that in turn creates a niche market for supermarkets that offer blemished products for a reduced price. One chain of supermarkets have started opening more locations near us and they advertise themselves as offering imperfect produce at a reduced price.\n\nDespite the above there's always the chance that a piece of truly rotten fruit sneaks through the cracks, and sometimes you'll pick up a piece of fruit only to see it's not only rotten but also a few of the ones underneath are too.
