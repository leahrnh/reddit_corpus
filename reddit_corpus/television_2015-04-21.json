Their 'job', in that it was their choice to do it, was showing the objectively funny nature of politics to people. Stuff that is so stupid that you have to laugh at it. Their job wasn't to tell people to go change any of this, that's a choice the people and the citizens have to make for themselves.

It doesn't tell you what to think, it shows you things, and lets you laugh at them if you want to. \n\n...and dude, it's America. The citizens as much as know their vote means absolutely nothing. You can put your vote into a certain representative and they don't give a fuck and a half about what they said they'd do or what they want to do, they do what their lobbyists pay them to do. Everyone in the US understands that their vote is so hugely partisan and so totally not controlled by the people anymore, it's like feudalism- their upper class makes choices. They don't.
