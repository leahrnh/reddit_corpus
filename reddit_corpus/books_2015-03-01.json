Albeit games are normally geared toward young adults , kids often play them too. Within those games are oftentimes words that are \"rare\" too. \n\nFor example , a kid plays Warcraft or Age of Empires or a similar RTS. Not only do they get exposed to fantasy lore and real life historical civilizations. They're exposed to contextual words like trebuchet , catapult, fortress, palisades, towers, crossbows, battering rams, headhunters, wyverns, barricades, etc. Words they will never come across in real life yet they'll know it and what they do. Come history class , they'll be well prepared with what medieval warfare was like. Perhaps jump starting a career in engineering , military, creative writing, etc. \n\nOn the other hand , RTS games would expose them on an advance level, economics , strategies, and teamwork. It'll give them an insight on supply and demand, pooling resources, specializing in your strengths and quickly exploiting your opponents weaknesses. Learn to strategize and choose best plans and back ups. And learn to communicate and work with others. \n\nGetting back on topic , it also exposes anyone to new words, double entendres, subtly, different meanings of those words, etc. I personally have learned more words and have been prepared better for school and writing back when I went from videos games than reading newspapers or books, although my interest gained from interactive medium led me to pursue reading more books on those subjects. \n\nNow that I'm older, I don't get why video games were looked so down upon as a society when I was a kid. They're, I think , the best medium to tell a story or entertain. Because you're not just a observer but an active participant. It's more immersive and interactive than any other , and it's on the cheaper end too. I understand most games are mindless and etc too but they do have their educational aspects too. \n\nRecent example - I was watching someone playing ... I think it was called \"The ship\"? Or whatever an older game and in there the bad guy used the word. ABATTOIR. If I never saw that I still wouldn't know what an abattoir (slaughterhouse) and now think when a kid learns that and writes a paper on concentration camps in highschool and refers , Dachau as an abattoir of sorts for humans.

He takes a relatively unquestioned concept (quality) and goes over it with a fine toothcomb.\n\nPhilosophy does't have to be about discovering something profound, sometimes it can be merely the exploration of something that we encounter everyday, but don't think to contemplate properly.

This list is very dubious.\n\nFirst of all, I'd like to clear out something regarding the presumed authoritativeness of the source: librarians. With all due respect, these guys are not philosophers, literary critics, philologists, writers, etc.. They are specialized in archiving, record keeping, librarianship and similar. Their job does not entail comparative reading of impressive numbers of books, and I'd assume most read in average volumes compared to the general population, perhaps many of them even less (sick and tired of handling books all day professionally). Their job isn't establishing the literary or philosophical (or any other form of) value of books - as this list proves aplenty.\n\nTherefore the fact that a reading list was created by librarians means nothing in itself. No more than a list suggested by, say, doctors or other categories of the intellectual persuasion.\n\nOn to the list, considering the lofty goal - books not to miss before one dies - the *Bible* and *The Alchemist* are immediate red flags. One could easily (and advisably, it could be argued) miss both, and have lost nothing! Then there's *Life of Pi*. And *The Time Traveller's Wife*. *Winnie the Pooh*? Really? Would not reading these generate such a grave loss of a lifetime? What about Dante's *The Divine Comedy*, for example? Or Milton's *Paradise Lost*? Or countless other masterpieces by any standard that are notably missing and that would likely constitute a far greater loss to a lifetime of reading than *Pride and Prejudice*.\n\nThe list should be in fact titled \"Which **fiction** books should every adult read...\". I would argue there are more non-fiction books that someone really should not miss in this life than there are fiction.
