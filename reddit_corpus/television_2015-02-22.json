I debated not watching it at all because of how old I was. That would surely have been a mistake, as I learned midway through season one.\n\nThis show did something that I hadn't seem before. In addition to the heroes's journey, it gave us the villain's (Zuko at the time of season 1) journey. I was confused at first. We got to see Zuko go from an exiled villain to a hero in his own right and one can easily see Avatar with *him* being the main character. And then you watch his story and Aang's story combine in season 3 in an amazing way.\n\nThis show was too good for Nickelodeon, and the way they treated it in season 3 was disgraceful.

Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes and dreams! You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion!\n\nOr...\n\n&gt; All you ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by. And someone who knows how to steer ships using stars. You finally got some of those rivers you'd wanted, and they led to the sea. These are dangerous, pirate-infested waters, and you cautiously send rat-infested ships across them, to establish lucrative trade at far-off merchant-infested ports. \nFirst, you will take over some islands, as a foothold. The natives seem friendly enough, crying their peace cries, and giving you spears and poison darts before you are even close enough to accept them properly. When you finally reach those ports you will conquer them, and from there you will look for more rivers. One day, all the rivers will be yours. \n\nand...\n\n&gt;Times have been hard.

The ravine is great; you get lots of sun, and you can just drop garbage wherever you want. In your free time you've taken up begging. Begging is brilliant conceptually, but tricky in practice since no one has any money. You beg twigs from the villagers, and they beg them back, but no one really seems to come out ahead. That's just how life is sometimes. You're quietly conquering people, minding your own business, when suddenly there's a plague, or barbarians, or everyone's illiterate, and it's all you can do to cling to some wreckage as the storm passes through.

Showing lots (and I mean lots) of scenery and many different locations are difficult in a play making (in my experience) the story seem a little more static and centrally located. CGI literally isn't a thing in plays yet, creating a huge deficit between movie visuals (in certain genres) and play visuals.\n\nYou just don't have these differences with live concerts, in fact concerts *add* to the experience: they take the sound from the music (not significantly diminished IMO, they can still add computer noises to a live performance or even voice sync) and add visuals to it (fireworks, fog machines, lasers, crowd surfing celebrities).\n\nNo, in order for \"plays\" to pick up the same role in the movie industry as live concerts have in the music industry they need to do two things:\n\n1. they need to create as good or better a visual and audio experience as the movie. That means no location restricts, the character needs to be able to walk down a block, in and out of stores, an jump out of an airplane with seemless transitions between scenery. Somehow CGI needs to be ported into reality so that we can have orcs an dragons and green sunsets and dogfights and space battles.\n\n2. they need to add to the experience similar to how concerts add visuals and celebrities to the music. This would be easier, you could add interaction between the audience and the cast. You could add smells. You could add weather, like wind or rain effects. Etc.\n\nTo do the first though, I don't think that will really happen until we get one very big thing n the entertainment industry: virtual reality. Once virtual reality becomes widespread we can actually combine the freedom of location, scenery, and CGI with a live action cast.

I've worked in a post production company, that is basically a middle man between the content producer and the foreign cinema chains and TV networks. Things haven't dropped in price AT ALL because of technology. Why? Because it's the status quo of the film industry. The post production company gets on the golf course with the producers, wines and dines them, and makes sure they use them as their servicing agent. Cinemas, TV networks etc have to go through the servicing agent to buy DCPs, artwork, trailers, and materials in different quality and at different FPS/resolution/specification. The company I worked in tried to change the industry, by actually charging prices that reflect the services, but we were basically bullied and muscled out by snakes that control the entire pricing structure in the industry.\n\nYou want to know why film has such massive overheads in middle management? Try this:\n- \u00a360 for a DVD with trailer materials... That's right, burning a DVD that takes five seconds and sending off to the post office.\n- \u00a31500 for a DCP, which costs \u00a3460 to produce at most.\n- \u00a3100 for access to an online server to transfer sound/dubbing materials, which costs \u00a330/month at most to maintain.\n\nThe film industry is fucked, and it deserves to die as it stands. We tried to change the status quo, and failed miserably, because at the end of the day, it's all about who you know, what golf club you belong to, and whose son you are.\n\n300%-500% profit margins are not the exception.\n\nI'm glad Netflix is shaking things up.

Shomi was a way for Rogers to move content from its free channel 100 Rogers on Demand service over to a service people would actually pay for, and all they had to do was fill out the content a bit. Crave is designed to keep you locked into a traditional cable package and consider online TV to be an add-on service, not a replacement for traditional TV service.\n\nAs well the goal for both of these services is to lock up streaming content rights that they already own for broadcast to prevent new competitors from popping up, or Netflix from expanding its programming. \nFor example since Bell owns CTV which airs a bunch of CW shows from the States, it is a way to expand that relationship and again push out a competitor like Netflix, since it gives Bell Media more bargaining power as more money is involved. It also keeps brand awareness on Bell since you consume both the traditional and the on-line version of the media through their branded service.\n\nMy conclusion from watching their moves with both services is that they aren't interested in a competitive on-demand landscape and will likely not be aiming for the type of mass market appeal Netflix has.

Tons of things get worse the more popular it is. Why? it's not that the creators are trying to maximize profits (at least not always.) it's that they attempt to make everyone happy. The key thing is to make something that makes you happy.\n\nHell dude, I am a game developer. Lets pick apart the most common game development cycle. Prototype-&gt;Crowd Funding-&gt;Alpha-&gt;Beta-&gt;Release.\n\nPrototype: You focus on a couple of main core mechanic or feature of your game and get it in front of people who are either investors or crowd funding sites. If you are lucky you will get funded. At this point you have spent maybe 2-8 weeks creating a prototype completely for free and probably doing something on the side to get paid. So far you have gotten 0 profits/revenue.   \n\nYou then get funded and you ideally get what you asked for on kickstarter or investors but a lot of these people think that it only costs 20k a person to live a year and that a kickstarter for a game should be under a 250,000 dollars unless you are a well known studio. So typically you ask for way less and hope you go way over your request. Lots of game studios get killed because of this. Well typically that requires at least a team of 4 but for more featured games it takes around 20 people. If you are making a multiplayer game you need backend developers, game developers, a web developer or two. 3D artists, animators, sound guys, Riggers for the animations. Everything and everyone costs money. On top of that you are going to need a couple of servers. So around 100 dollars a month at least with a few copies of software like Maya, Visual Studio and etc so thats a few dozen licenses around 10,000 dollars total. When all is said and done you are ready to start development.   \n\nSo after you support your studio for 4-5 months you can finally release an alpha! Oh joy everyone is going to be so happy that it's going to be exactly like they all thought it would be when you pitched the prototype. Except you made the prototype alone and everyone has their own opinion. So the artists did the art slightly different from what you were thinking but its still awesome. The sound guy put his small twist on it because nothing replicates from brain to paper like it should and the programmer made the physics like real life but you didn't realize that cars turn differently than what you thought. So finally the alpha is out and everyone just starts bitching. \"This isn't finished\" \"This isn't exactly how you pitched it\" \"This doesn't look correct\" So what do you do? They paid for the game. You tell them to shut up and wait until it's done then they ask why they are even in the alpha anyways. You change it to how they want it then you get people bitching about what you are bitching about.\n\nSo for beta. That's when you feature lock. The alpha is for getting every single feature you want in your game. Period. The beta is for balance adjustments, tweaks and glitch fixes. This is the time that usually gets shaved off because who really needs a beta when you can release a tad buggy. And usually by that time the original backers are screaming their faces off \"IT'S BEEN 9 MONTHS. I MADE A BABY IN THAT TIME! WHAT DID YOU DO?!\" and \"9 months is what Cativision takes to release the Dog's of Duty Campaign! What's taking this small game so long!\" So just fucking release it and get those people off your backs and start on the patches.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh6e", "qSentId": 18566, "question": "&gt; There is always youtube and etc. People will always be creative.\n\nYouTube went to shit years ago, pandering to 16-year olds and 800,000+ gaming/let's play channels.\n\nIt's always the same cycle: creativity and innovation at the start, and once it's popularity becomes mainstream, a slow death of pandering to the lowest-common denominator to maximize profits.\n\n", "aSentId": 18569, "answer": "Depends on the type of youtube channels you watch..no one is forcing you to sit and evaluate lets play channels", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh6e", "qSentId": 18550, "question": "There is always youtube and etc. People will always be creative.", "aSentId": 18571, "answer": "Yeah but YouTube people will never make game of thrones.

I already know it becomes about his ego. I am aware he gets back into Meth cooking because Jesse can still cook his Meth. I am saying that it did not start as that. And he turned down the old partners offer because he hates them for what they did to him. I recommend you go back and rewatch the first season. Walt is a lovable, caring dad who constantly gets abused and pushed around. Hank makes jokes at his expense in front of his family, he works at the car wash where the manager is a dick to him and so is his student, so when he turns down the offer, you understand that this is a dying man who doesn't want the former partners who he feels cheated by to feel great about them paying for a dying Walt's treatment. When he goes into cooking, he is very scared and is lost. And throughout the show, Walt became more and more egotistical and selfish. But the show would never let you forget that this started because a dying man wanted to give his family security. Walt is prepared to die when he goes into cooking. And even in the end he goes back to followthrough with his original purpose. And gets his ex-partners(who you also are shown why he hates them, when they go on TV and say he had little to no involvement in the company which the name is fucking half Walt!) he makes them give the money to his kids. The show is reminding us of Walt's noble purpose that created the evil and sad man that Walt is later in the series. Walt definitely knows who he's become. We can remember the face he makes after he realizes what he's done when he takes his daughter he kidnapped out of the car. Walt was turned into a monster. But the show was designed to make you like him by giving motivation that everybody can understand. Being told you have little time to live, wanting the provide for your family, and because he was constantly walked all over by everyone around him. Walt is the surprising hero, but is overcome by adrenaline and ego. He could never go back to his life because he had already come to terms with dying. I can imagine it would be very difficult to have accepted death and to be told it wasn't going to happen. And a LOT of ex-cancer patients have the same problem.\n\nI am not saying it wasn't about his ego. I am saying it became about his ego more and more throughout the series. But it started with noble purpose. The show is titled, Breaking Bad, meaning Walt started as good. And a good man cannot just be about his ego. It is about how Walt slowly breaks and breaks. He started as a Dr. Walt and Mr Heisenberg.(Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde might be spelled wrong) But in the end couldn't go back to being Walt. A good man with good intentions.
