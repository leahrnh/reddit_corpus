War's a horrible, terrible thing that's more down to luck for survival than any skill.  I get pretty keyed up when people talk about wanting violent revolution in the US because I've seen plenty of footage from Ukraine, Syria, etc.  That's real war where both sides are similarly armed, with similar capabilities.  The wars we've been involved in the past 14 years are nothing compared to that.  As a result the US has gotten a skewed perception of what war is like.\n\nBUT! (there's always a but!) there's times when it's the only way to resolve issues in a manner satisfactory to everyone.  There's always some asshole who feels like forcing their will on someone else.  Germany winning WW1 would have been a horrible thing for the European continent, for various reasons.  \n\nSure it should have been avoidable but it didn't happen that way.  The splintering of the empires ended up being a good thing for countries like Poland, who'd been carved up in the late 18th century.  At the same time the partitioning and industrialization of Poland under the Russians/Germans benefited the Poles long term.  \n\nSo then we come to WW2, where after the horrors of WW1 everyone desperately wanted to avoid war.  Appeasement kicked in as an attempt to avoid another war.  Didn't work out because again, some parties wanted war.  Eventually became unavoidable.  After the war we found out exactly how bad German occupation was and the costs that went along with it.\n\nAnyway, I do understand your point and the point All Quiet made.  Armies are made up of individuals, all with their own personalities, hopes, dreams, and family.  The unavoidable personal impact of war is what makes it so terrible.  People get killed.  People get maimed.  Those hopes and dreams get snuffed out by a few ounces of lead.  Lives get ruined because of what's experienced.  It's fucking terrible.\n\nIt's still got to occur sometimes because occasionally there's things that can't be rolled over for and a country has to violently defend itself.  Should Ukraine really roll over for Russia?  Should the Alawaites/Shia in Syria have just let the Sunni majority take over when they'd just seen how minorities were treated in Iraq?  They feel they're fighting for their survival, the same way the Sunni feel after years of horrible shit Assad did.  \n\nGovernments stay in charge because people feel that overall the governments benefit the society of that country.  The responsibility that comes with being in charge of a country/military are insane.  Should a country's leadership really just sit back, think of the pain and suffering of individual soldiers when they feel that failure to fight will cause more pain and suffering for the country as a whole?\n\nThe flip side of that is sometimes the government isn't looking out for the people, just themselves or business interests.

My stance is not correct, and niether is yours.  There is really no right answer, because the answer all goes down to philosophy.  A utilitarian may agree with war on the premise that the net sum of civilian deaths in war may be less than no war (even though deaths occur both ways).  I'm not utilitarian in that there is much more to this than killing.  This whole thing is about differences in ideologies and about corruption and ignorance.  ISIS likely believes they are the good guys bringing back the true values of Islam and bringing a utopia.  They are not inherently evil, just misguided.  \n\nOne thing you must realize is that everyone is a condition of their environment.

But I'm pointing out inaccuracies so I guess it's natural for you to get defensive.\n\nYou wrote, \"equality wasn't even a concept amongst white people. \"\n\nIt was. Part of my post is a rebuttal against that assertion. \n\n1. I didn't base it solely on the Constitution. I pointed out a lot of writing of the time reflected the idea of equality.  \n\n2. I was VERY clear that parts of the Constitution and the B.O.R. are *examples* of the Founding Fathers application of the idea of equality. Was it fully applied to everyone? No (pointed that out, btw). But did it eventually lead to a larger understanding of equality that includes everyone. Undoubtedly. Do we still continue to wrestle with the application of the ideas of equality for everyone? Yep. Will we for a long time to come? Without a doubt.\n\n3. And I even pointed out that it wasn't applied to the less fortunate. \n\nI specifically rebutted 2 points:\n\n1. That \"equality wasn't a concept\". It was, indeed, a well-documented concept widely written about at the time and for centuries prior to the Founding Fathers. And not just equality for wealth land-owners.\n\n2. That the Founding Fathers only cared about wealth land owners. While some most certainly did (something I also wrote), the reality is that the founding documents of this country (written by them) don't support your statement both in intent and in application. Not all Founding Fathers were wealthy landowners or lawyers. And there were certainly a lot of voices and opinions around that helped shape the beginnings of the country. Advocates for 'equality' were among them.\n\nI'm not blind. Not at all.

Likewise, the government cannot take any action without voter/congressional approval, because they do not yet have the power. \n\nI read a statistic today that said that internet speeds have increased 196x over the last 15-years. That's absolutely phenomenal. In the last year alone, speeds increased 21% on average. Do you really see this as a broken system that needs \"fixing\"? Of course not. The system works great right now. You should stop trying to mess with it, because you're going to invite potential disaster. Take a look at the kinds of things that are authorized in Title 2, and tell me if you want those applied to the internet. \n\n&gt; You're against network neutrality, so that corporations can charge you to deliver content, but you're ok with the status quo of the NSA eavesdropping on all internet traffic it can coerce out of providers?\n\nNSA eavesdropping is obviously an entirely different issue. However, you should think about the fact that the NSA was also given a *very narrow* range of powers under legal statute. Over time, they interpreted that legalese to grant them the ability to do what they want. In the case of Title 2, there is not even a legal statute limiting the government's ability to implement all provisions of Title 2. The only thing limiting that power is the discretion of the President. Obama won't be in office forever. \n\nAlso, it should be noted, all of your basic concerns about net neutrality were ameliorated with a recent Republican-backed bill. However, it did not allow expansion of FCC-regulation of the internet, so it was shot down by Democrats. \n\nhttp://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/01/republican-net-neutrality-bill-would-gut-fccs-authority-over-broadband/\n\nIf you really cared about the internet, you'd want to restrict the government's control over it to the same (or greater) extent that you want to limit ISP control over it. In other words, you'd support a similar compromise bill to the one above.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13","qSentId": 20514,"question": "I was being facetious, laughing at the idea that there's a concerted effort out there to target human rights.

Or are Russian army forces or special ops teams actually carrying personal military ID and passports?","aSentId": 21008,"answer": "&gt;What's the most logical reason for the ID's to be there?\n\nBecause they are private citizens acting on their own initiative. If they did not have those papers, how could they return to Russia? Official troops don't need passports to return to their bases.\n\nThis is assuming they are not outright fakes.\n\n&gt;how did Ukraine come into possession of legitimate ID's of Russians\n\nThere are hundreds of thousands if not millions of dual citizens in Ukraine. A hell of a lot of Ukrainian nationals have a Russian passport.\n\nYou know, like an ex-Pat American living in the UK would still have an American passport.\n\n&gt; Or are Russian army forces or special ops teams actually carrying personal military ID and passports?\n\nThat is the most *unlikely* explanation of all. You do not carry identifying documents into combat, specifically to prevent them being used to gather intelligence (or being held up in press conferences) if they fall into enemy hands.\n\nIt's a \"no-brainer\". Any army worth it's salt confiscates identifying documents before sending troops into combat.

It was an agreement between CCP and the British government, which suggested such course be taken after CCP takes over.\n\n2) The suggested course of action had a much longer timeline, planned and written. However a number of people decided that they know better and want it right now at this instance, which is very naive and childish to say the least.\n\n3) They were allowed a higher degree of freedom of expression within Hongkong, they decided to exercise that right outside of HK. No shit they are gonna get in trouble. This is China's internal political situation, bringing in India or any other country shows huge lack of understanding of the situation. If they did this within HK it probably wouldn't have been seized.\n\n4) As someone else in the thread pointed out, China also stopped similar merchandise that could have caused trouble for Obama. So it's not a suppression towards HK specifically, it's their very conservative way of handling politics. Bad or not, they have been consistent and this should not be a surprise.

I also did stage building work and those are long hours to... but not week in week out. 2-3 days max. And afterwards a day asleep to recover. And I was back then I healthy young man (yes really although I admit it was a long time ago).\n\nIf you asked me back then to do your gf's work pattern. No fucking way and not just out of entitlement, I just wouldn't have been able to handle it, nowadays it would kill me or my family would do it for me. When does she sleep? Go out? Eat? Relax? Have fun? Sleep? \n\nThat you don't find any japanese sources for inemuri, it often takes outsiders to obverse a societies oddness.\n\nFor instance no Dutch person ever would comment on the old practice to sweep even scrub the pavement in front of the house.

The commute is only about 30 minutes. She usually catches up on sleep on days 6 and 7, and we usually spend her one day off watching a movie or doing other relaxing things. \n\nYou can imagine that she lost a bit of weight since she started this job - she has dinner at 12, which infuriates me, but she seems okay with it. I'm happy to say that I could convince her to switch jobs in the near future.\n\nThanks for the kind comment sfc1971. I like what you said about the pavements.

They hold on to it until they're at a point that they feel it's too much for them to bear, and until their quality of life is simply not there any longer.

So I didn't feel the need to explain the slow code since I was replying to someone that already did, my bad on that one. Also I didn't reply to the comments since for past 3hrs I was in my labs class and I will be doing a big Edit to cover these replies to save time again my bad.\n\nSo a slow code is essentially a Blue code which means that someone is crashing and needs resuscitation; but the difference is with a slow code is that everyone around that would respond to it goes just slow enough that they will not be able to resuscitate in time.\n\nNow a lot of you feel this is terrible and shouldn't be done and is \"murdering\" the patient and often done without consent of the family this is however very untrue. Most slow codes is due to fact the patient had expressed to die before they went under in case of certain events to their nurse and doctor. But once the patient themselves can't say anything power of attorney is turned over to someone else usually a family member.\n\nThe family now is coming to the scenario with a couple of things blinding their judgement 1. Unknowing the patients true feelings or final sentiments of how they should be treated. 2. Not knowing the full ramifications of loved one's condition (look some people can't be saved this isn't a movie where they wake up from a 10 year coma people). 3. In denial about survival rate or wishes of loved one because they themselves want them to live but haven't come to terms with it.\n\nNow these people are health care professionals will try everything to make a person live but they also know when a person is most likely going to die a week or two later just full of agony or just not waking back up at all. So when they see the family come in grieving, their patient in pain and suffering beyond belief and may not even be there mentally. They do this out of a mercy and respect for a general human beings life. When a dog or pet is suffering horribly we put it down, in the movies when the young recruit got his lower half of his body blown off our hero the Sergeant puts a bullet in his head to end his suffering. Both of these scenarios people agree with and it truly is no different in the hospital; just because they are in a facility meant to save lives surrounded by hundreds of professionals that when to school for years to save lives too, does not mean that some just can't be saved and they just see it there suffering and suffering until it is over and some people just don't like seeing those sweet princes writhe in agony while their loved ones watch eyes full of tears and disillusioning themselves. \n\nSo those brave few in society make the decision that others can't make, the ones that have sacrificed years of their life learning to help those in trouble and even more years doing so. The ones that were there with your loved ones the day the entered the hospital working inhumanly long shifts and under huge stress to insure that every single one leaves that hospital stronger and healthier before. Connecting on a personal level with their patients even though they know most wont make it. But yet they do it day in and day out most never receiving the thanks they deserve. Decide that they wish to send the sweet prince of gently into the night are they really so heinous and to blame for the death of your loved one I think not.\n\nNow that is out of the way I do think people would be more on board with Doctor assisted suicide because the route of all this is a lack of education and objective thinking when the time to decide comes. So even though family should have last say (unless patient has said otherwise) I don't trust that they are the right ones to make that kind of decision if they don't understand the situation. So by just even knowing about the slow code I think most people could start making the right decisions for their loved ones or like how some suggest they would change their opinion if they shadowed a nurse or doctor in long term care for just a day.\n\nIf  you don't believe me read some of the many insightful comments from people that had first hand experience with it.\n\nTl;dr: Educate yourself about slow code, long term patient care, and people personal stories about how it has helped them.

What is easiest (by easiest I mean cheapest, most convenient) often becomes what is practiced. \n\nSo unless you are putting in place a framework upon which these pressures are demonstrably excluded and decisions are always guaranteed to be initiated by the patient and no-one else, and I don't see how you can which is why I asked what you had in mind, I don't know if we should be so quick to put in place a system that allows for these eventualities, however slim you may think they are. \n\nTo me the easiest way to subvert such outcomes, however plausible or implausible you see them, is to have a system that cannot be manipulated to allow for such an outcome. I guess what I'm saying is, and I've thought about this a lot, although I am open to hearing alternative arguments, is that it is more ethically justifiable to allow suffering in life than to allow for the possibility that life becomes a price tag and death a cheap alternative.\n\nI know this sounds like a fallacious slippery slope, and maybe it is, but I just think we have to examine what we ultimately value, because that is what determines our allowances. I have to stand by my own convictions that life must be the most inherently valued thing in our society, more than convenience, money, or whatever else. I know this is not what you are arguing for in physician assisted suicide, but I'm saying you have to allow for the possibility that it devolves into physician (or by proxy familial) *initiated* suicide. Because if we don't ultimately place the value of a human in their life itself, then it becomes something else; the value they bring to society, their measurable contributions, etc. And what do we do with these \"useless eaters\"? If you don't believe that the old and vulnerable and weak in our society will ultimately be exploited, manipulated, and discarded, then I don't know if you've been paying attention to human history. \n\nSorry for the lengthy reply, and I may have totally misrepresented your position, if so then believe me I'm sorry!

And you're obviously not working through this, as you already have an opinion that won't be changed. But that's ok. I really really understand your point of argumentation. That the simple possibility of abuse makes it probable that abuse will happen. \n\nSo there's this law that could help some people and like many laws, there will be people who abuse it. It's like, we produce painkillers and their legal. Some people become addicted but many people will just successfully ease their pain (and I get why this example is flawed, but maybe you understand the point?). Ultimately the law is what we make of it. It lives and fails with the people who live under it. \n\nI'm also very worried about abuse because I realise it's possible. But we're had the possibility of assisted suicide here for years and so far, it has never been mainstream enough for people to adopt the point of view that anyone who is suffering should just man up and end it instead of complaining. Even though it has been legal for a long time now, it's still seen as a real alternative to Palliative care except by the people suffering. It's still rather rare that people choose that solution and the eligibility process is strict. So far, it seems to work here. We don't have the situation where a ton of people are just regularly pressuring their grandparents into suicide to save costs for assisted living. But I understand that it might not always like that. And it might not be like that everywhere. Cultures are different. Some handle it one way and some another. If there's a shift of assisted suicide towards a mainstream option, I might find it hard to maintain the right to choose for those suffering. But right now, after years of experience, your dystopia has not yet happened here and people have a very reasonable approach.\n\nI guess the way a society deals with assisted suicide depends a lot ob how they view and treat old and sick people in general. If we treat our parents with respect, we won't ask then to die to save money (of course there are always some people .....)\n\nAnd on the value of life. I value life inherently for the precious and (in the scale of the Universe) rare thing that it us. Life is so complex and never seizes to amaze me. But I also value human beings. And I have seen people suffering so much, that they choose death over life. Imagine the amount if suffering that takes. I haven't been in their shoes, but empathy helps me respect their decision. Most people are afraid of death. It takes an enormous process to abandon this fear. The suffering I've seen ...... Some people deserve to make that decision for themselves. It is not our right to take that from them. We are not in their shoes. In some cases I value their right to decide higher than life.\n\nAs I said, it's a tough subject. I definitely see both sides. In my profession, I have been more exposed to suffering and I have so far never ever  encountered outside pressure on a patient. I always felt that the patient took that decision against the will of their family and they had to come to terms with that decision. So, while I completely understand your point (and might share it, had I lived a different life), my experiences have conviced me of the importance for patients to ultimately choose their end.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13","qSentId": 25123,"question": "You don't.

","aSentId": 26076,"answer": "Well, first of all I don't see a neurodevelopmental disorder like autism as falling into the same category as a psychiatric disease such as clinical depression.  But you make a good point--if someone with profound autism (but still considered to be of sound mind) wanted to end the suffering caused by their disorder, there very well might be a case to make that their disorder merits assisted suicide.  That such a person would feel so badly about their disorder to begin with, however, is something I think we should address as a society before we start considering allowing doctors to end their lives...\n\nBut I would like to address this point:\n\n&gt; In addition, I don\u2019t see how the desire for suicide when you are dying from cancer should be seen as separate from that illness.\n\n...As I have stated above, the significant difference here is that suicide is the endpoint of the untreated disease process of mental disorders such as clinical depression.  That's what makes depression a different disease from cancer: suicide in that case is means of ending physical pain that cannot otherwise be alleviated.  For mental illness, suicide is more often a resort for people who are simply unable, due to the progression of their disease leaving them in an unsound mental state, to see that there is a potential means of ending their suffering that allows them to continue living.  Is it always?  Maybe not, but having seen first-hand the mistakes they routinely make with people suffering from mental illness, I don't leave it to the judgement of doctors to be able to discern the difference between a sound decision to end mental suffering and a cry for help from a sick person.  At this point the science of treating this type of mental disorder is, in my opinion, too imprecise for that.  And I suspect that there are a lot of doctors who would agree on that point.\n\nAt any rate, I am very happy to hear that you were able to find a successful treatment for your disease, and I don't mean to demean your experience or the conclusions you have drawn from it.  However in my experience, which most recently involved spending three weeks last summer at the hospital bedside of my father who was suffering from a fully catatonic mental breakdown stemming from a combination of clinical depression and schizoaffective disorder, I don't believe that it's ever appropriate either to give up on these patients, or to accept that they have done so.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13","qSentId": 26069,"question": "If that were true then there would be no euthanasia for people suffering from mental illness, since other than dementia patients the  \"untreatable\" mental illness is completely mythological.\n\nAlso if that were true, then those patients would not be considered to be in sound mind, lucid moments or not.

It is highly possible that if assisted suicide becomes more common and accepted those who are elderly or terminally ill will feel some degree of pressure to 'get on with it' to unburden their families of the difficulties involved in taking time off work to visit in the hospital and care for them.\n\nI worry that this could be abused by family members who have a financial stake in the death of the person who is ill and could pressure them in some way to resort to physician assisted suicide. My concerns are even graver if euthanasia comes into play- if family members are allowed to make the decision about when the ill person is killed.\n\nI have concerns that even though the current ruling states that no doctor will be compelled to perform an assisted suicide that this will not apply once it becomes more ingrained into society. Right now the college of physicians and surgeons of Ontario are debating a policy about professional obligations and human rights which would require doctors to prescribe birth control pills and make referrals for abortions. And perform these procedures if it is \"urgent or otherwise necessary to prevent imminent harm, suffering, and/or deterioration\"  Regardless of my belief that people should have access to birth control I do believe doctors should be able to follow their consciences and if assisted suicide is deemed 'urgent or otherwise necessary to prevent imminent harm suffering or deterioration' then doctors could be compelled to participate.\n\nMy deepest concerns involve what this will change in our society when it comes to discourses surrounding disabilities and what constitutes a life worth living. I am concerned that people who are elderly and in need of a great deal of daily care might come to feel as though they are burdens rather than human beings with dignity and worth. I am concerned that people will come to feel more shame regarding deterioration of mental faculties and bodily functions. \n\nI am concerned that this will disincentivize research into pain control and quality of life issues for those who are terminally ill, elderly or suffering.\n\nPlease understand that I have relatives who I love who I have watched deteriorate from alzheimers.

","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13","qSentId": 26710,"question": "Here  is the case, I just read it: http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1657039/supreme-court-ruling-on-assisted-dying.pdf\n\nYou have to keep in mind, **this is not a decision by Canada.** This is a decision by the Supreme Court of Canada, which is handful of judges who are appointed.\n\nThe Law Itself:\n&gt; The appropriate remedy is therefore a declaration that s. 241(b) and s. 14\nof the Criminal Code are void insofar as they prohibit physician-assisted death for a\ncompetent adult person who (1) clearly consents to the termination of life; and (2) has\na grievous and irremediable medical condition (including an illness, disease or\ndisability) that causes enduring suffering that is intolerable to the individual in the\ncircumstances of his or her condition. \n\nThe a competent person is a capable person.  **The test for capability is a very low threshold test**.  In Canada you can die for your religious beliefs or for stupid decisions, so long as you can appreciate that you will die.  It is a very very low threshold test.  Canada traditionally does not recognize vulnerable persons that well, if someone is basically non-functional from mental illness, or unconscious, they are uncapable.  People with severe mental illness can be capable persons.\n\nIn Canada, the definition of an adult varies province by province, it is generally 18 or 19, so this legislation will do nothing for people who are under that age.\n\nSo yes, if there is someone with HIV in Canada, that does not want treatment because they believe that drugs are the work of evil pharmaceutical companies, they can easily be found to be capable and the law states that they do not need to get treatment to forcefully improve their quality of life, yes it is required that a physician be found to kill that person if that person can appreciate that they will die when seeking assisted suicide from physician to physician.  This is a serious problem the judge has ignored citing that physicians can figure it out.\n\n&gt; In our view, this is not a proper case for a constitutional exemption. We\nhave found that the prohibition infringes the claimants\u2019 s. 7 rights. Parliament must\nbe given the opportunity to craft an appropriate remedy. The concerns raised in\nFerguson about stand-alone constitutional exemptions are equally applicable here:\nissuing such an exemption would create uncertainty, undermine the rule of law, and\nusurp Parliament\u2019s role. Complex regulatory regimes are better created by Parliament\nthan by the courts. \n\nCanada already does allow for patients terminally ill who worsen or do not improve, with consent, to be discontinued treatment by physicians from a previous Supreme Court decision.  You can already be allowed to die by natural causes or the disease itself while retaining your dignity with palliative care.\n\nThe only safeguard to protect vulnerable patients is the judgement of the physician, or until they find another physician who is sufficiently bad enough to kill a potentially vulnerable person: \n\n&gt; As the trial judge noted, the individual assessment of vulnerability\n(whatever its source) is implicitly condoned for life-and-death decision-making in\nCanada. In some cases, these decisions are governed by advance directives, or made\nby a substitute decision-maker. Canada does not argue that the risk in those\ncircumstances requires an absolute prohibition (indeed, there is currently no federal\nregulation of such practices). In A.C., Abella J. adverted to the potential vulnerability\nof adolescents who are faced with life-and-death decisions about medical treatment\n(paras. 72-78). Yet, this Court implicitly accepted the viability of an individual\nassessment of decisional capacity in the context of that case. We accept the trial\njudge\u2019s conclusion that it is possible for physicians, with due care and attention to the\nseriousness of the decision involved, to adequately assess decisional capacity. \n\nOne Judge made this decision.  Canada is screaming that she is ignoring the serious risks at play and too readily relying on it being \"possible\".\n\n&gt; The resolution of the issue before us falls to be resolved not by competing anecdotes, but by the evidence. The trial judge, after an exhaustive review of the evidence,\nrejected the argument that adoption of a regulatory regime would initiate a descent\ndown a slippery slope into homicide. \n\nMeanwhile Canada had come to a different conclusion.\n\n\n\nParliament, which is a body of people elected by the Canadian people, have worked extensively to legalize doctor-assisted suicide (which falls under euthanasia or 1st degree murder, traditionally).  But the effort has been difficult due to a lack of safeguards and if this will be abused.\n\nOne of the judges found the safeguards to be sufficient, despite evidence indicating the contrary.  Canada is criticizing the legislation.\n\n&gt; Canada says that the trial judge made a palpable and overriding error in\nconcluding that safeguards would minimize the risk associated with assisted dying.\nCanada argues that the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that the level of risk was acceptable\nflies in the face of her acknowledgment that some of the evidence on safeguards was\nweak, and that there was evidence of a lack of compliance with safeguards in\npermissive jurisdictions. Canada also says the trial judge erred by relying on cultural differences between Canada and other countries in finding that problems experienced\nelsewhere were not likely to occur in Canada. \n\nThe judges decided that Canada's case was not sufficient to reject the Judge's decision.  Huh?\n\n&gt; At trial, Canada went into some detail about the risks associated with the\nlegalization of physician-assisted dying. In its view, there are many possible sources\nof error and many factors that can render a patient \u201cdecisionally vulnerable\u201d and\nthereby give rise to the risk that persons without a rational and considered desire for\ndeath will in fact end up dead. It points to cognitive impairment, depression or other\nmental illness, coercion, undue influence, psychological or emotional manipulation,\nsystemic prejudice (against the elderly or people with disabilities), and the possibility\nof ambivalence or misdiagnosis as factors that may escape detection or give rise to\nerrors in capacity assessment. Essentially, Canada argues that, given the breadth of\nthis list, there is no reliable way to identify those who are vulnerable and those who\nare not. As a result, it says, a blanket prohibition is necessary. \n\n\n&gt; Canada also argues that the permissive regulatory regime accepted by the\ntrial judge \u201caccepts too much risk\u201d, and that its effectiveness is \u201cspeculative\u201d (R.F., at\npara. 154). In effect, Canada argues that a blanket prohibition should be upheld\nunless the appellants can demonstrate that an alternative approach eliminates all risk.\nThis effectively reverses the onus under s. 1, requiring the claimant whose rights are\ninfringed to prove less invasive ways of achieving the prohibition\u2019s object. The\nburden of establishing minimal impairment is on the government. \n\n\nRead the full document.  There are serious reasons why this is limited.  It makes me frustrated that a small collection of unelected judges can freely make laws, rather than leave the decisions to parliament to carefully craft laws.\n\n**TL:DR:**  This is not a black and white issue.  Parliament has been working for a very long time on this legislation and the Supreme Court has rushed to enact something that is disregarding the dangers of the vulnerable against Canada's concerns.  I hope the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons will require doctors to not follow this legislation until the Canadian people can enact a law that protects the vulnerable, and we can eventually allow people the choice of assisted suicide so they are not forced to take their own lives prematurely while they are still capable, while protecting the vulnerable.","aSentId": 26711,"answer": "If we use the last few pieces of legislation put in place by parliament we should all be very very afraid.

But is it?\n\nIn deciding whether to respect an actor's will, we typically ask whether that will is rational. For example, we probably would not respect a healthy person's wish to saw off his arm because there is no circumstance in which such a desire seems rational. Applying the same analysis to the euthanasia context leads us to the following question: Is it ever rational to prefer being dead to being alive, no matter how meaningless and intolerable the latter might seem? \n\nThere is a strong argument to be made that the answer is no. Death, as far as we know, is absolute nothingness. We have no conception of it. In fact, the state of being dead is by its nature impossible to imagine. It is not clear how someone can rationally claim to prefer something that is impossible to cognize. \n\nThe strongest argument for preferring death to life goes something like this: \"Very soon, I will be dead. My present suffering is intolerable. My expected suffering will be even more intolerable. Whatever being dead is like, it must be better than the misery of being alive.\"\n\nThe problem with this line of thought is twofold. First, it is not clear what is meant by \"intolerable.\" The only thing that is absolutely and truly intolerable is that which the body cannot physically sustain (i.e., that which is physically unsurvivable). Everything else is capable of being tolerated/survived, provided one's will is strong enough. Think of survivors of the most gruesome torture that had no foreseeable end. \n\nSecond, even if one adopts a less stringent definition of \"intolerable,\" it is not coherent to say that death is \"better\" than anything. Death, as I said, is absolute nothingness. It has zero value. Death is so valueless that it is impossible to imagine what being dead would be like, unless we resort to some delusional and self-serving notion of the \"afterlife.\" As long as (and only if) the brain is still capable of cognizing experience, even at a very basic and demented level, we have reason to continue living. Death might relieve \"intolerable\" suffering, but nothingness is worse than the worst suffering. Or, non-experience is worse than the worst form of experience.\n\nOne might say that there is no point in living once one's personality and identity have gone. That even if we are capable of crude experience at that point, the experience will not be ours. But I am not sure why this would concern anyone. If the experience will not be ours, why worry about it? That experience will be the experience of the new demented \"person\" who will occupy our old physical shell.

The problem is that they don't have a good constitutional basis for overriding the legislature on the issue.\n\nTo say \"a right to life\" means you have the right to end your life if your life isn't satisfactory to you is a logical non-sequitur.  I am just as qualified as any judge to discuss logic.  It is a logical leap that was made only to justify an end.... The judges wanted to legalize suicide for their own personal, political, or moral reasons.  They crafted a convenient argument to justify their decision.\n\nYou may agree with the judges' decision, but I do not.\n","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13","qSentId": 27101,"question": "Dick Cheney has been invited for a test run.","aSentId": 27102,"answer": "Wow, so current!

Dumping this amount is pretty damaging to the benthos (macroinvertebrates that live on the floor). Bacteria are good at biodegrading oil aerobically, but much less so anaerobically. If the oil is buried very shallowly, (&lt;2cm) bacteria can access it relatively easily, and degrade it. When we say \"oil\" that's a very general term for a conglomerate of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which degrade at different rates, since they differ in size, and complexity, from benzene (technically not polycyclic) to benzo-[a]-pyrene (not likely to be found in this oil). Bacteria will degrade these hydrocarbons into smaller chains, but they really won't degrade the larger chains if they're buried.\n\nI spent 4 years doing research at a creosote spill, which should have been a superfund site, and wrote a thesis on exactly this type of thing.

The bigger picture of why we have a government and legal rules governing the actions of a firm is because it forces us all to play by rules any given individual might prefer to break, but we are all better off following. A nice simple metaphor would be rules in Football preventing players from maliciously attacking one another; if one player can and get away with it, it improves their team's chances of winning, but they are overall happy the rule exists.\n\n3.)  This is based on humans innate desire to have more (pursuit of profit), and the view that we use law to prevent firm actions society thinks are unproductive and/or does not want to see. So within this framework, it is justified for a firm to optimize profit, as it is implicit in this statement that it must do so whilst following the rules of the game, which attempt to formalize ethical preferences of a society. So in this sense a company's sole purpose is a statement that has implicit in it a complex set of constraints.\n\n4.) Saying our' sole purpose is to procreate' is a strong and unfounded assumption. So even assuming your conclusion logically follows, your assumption isn't obvious by any measure. 'Sole purpose' is a strong statement, which means it's literally our only purpose. Hence having meaningful relationships, raising children, spending time with your brother, etc, are all assumed to be meaningless. If our sole purpose is to procreate, we would just be in a huge human clusterfuck orgy all the time.\n\n5.) But let's take a more forgiving reading of your usage of the phrase 'sole purpose.' In this case we won't attack your assumption, but instead your conclusion. If we say your 'sole purpose' is to procreate, and assume you meant something like 'to have children and pass on genes' (as opposed to the strict meaning of what you said), we should consider how you would best achieve that goal. For example, by not being locked up in jail or executed, but instead being able to care and provide for your child, you stand a better chance of succeeding in procreating. If you rape a women you have a very very small chance of her becoming pregnant, not having an abortion, and having a child. Much much lower than if you were to work on finding a willing partner who wants to try and have multiple children with you. Moreover, if you were to rape a women, you would consider this is a bad idea because of legal systems that punish you. This has some parallels to a firm wanting to maximize profits, but does not engage in immediate and wanton theft, because they know the government would punish this. Again, it is a statement that has implicit in it a set of constraints as a function of legal rules and institutions.\n\n\nNow, you might be tempted to respond to this by saying that legal institutions do not always line up perfectly with what is ethical, and that sometimes a firm trying to maximize profits results in bad outcomes. To this I have two replies: 1.) This might be true, but it's not what you said. You made an awful syllogistic argument about rape, which is silly and wrong. And 2.) The most efficient market and legal systems assume firms will try to maximize profits and benefit, and create a set of rules/laws that allow them to pursue this singular goal such that they ultimately do not commit any unethical actions by following the law (US actually is generally good at this, most firms do actually benefit society more than they cost society through unethical or violent actions, but obviously the system isn't perfect, but I never suggested it was).","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13","qSentId": 27669,"question": "So if our sole purpose is to procreate, then am I justified in raping whomever I want?","aSentId": 27672,"answer": "It's tough to assess the counterfactual. We have to find out whether the foundation of our postulates has other logical consequences. In this case, we'd need to know whether whatever it is that would give us that sole purpose would change the nature of justification. If our purpose was different, then something more fundamental to purpose must also be different, in order to permit the different meaning of purpose. And maybe that more fundamental thing would have some bearing on justification.\n\nI don't know what would make it true that \"our sole purpose is to procreate\", but once we do, we might have an easier time figuring out what justice, or justification, would mean.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13","qSentId": 27669,"question": "So if our sole purpose is to procreate, then am I justified in raping whomever I want?","aSentId": 27674,"answer": "If you pay fees &amp;amp; taxes on the rape and submit a proposal of the rape to future victims, then yes.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13","qSentId": 27675,"question": "If you pay fees &amp;amp; taxes on the rape and submit a proposal of the rape to future victims, then yes.","aSentId": 27676,"answer": "Thanks for the laugh.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13","qSentId": 27590,"question": "This is literally what a company's sole purpose is ","aSentId": 27680,"answer": "This is utter bullshit.\n\na \"Company\" has absolutely no \"Purpose\" other than what is directed by that company's leader.\n\nIf that leader makes it their purpose to rape and pillage everything and anything, then that is the responsibility of the leader to reap the benefits AND whatever else they earn by doing this, be it criminal charges or a lynch mob.  \n\nEvery time someone says what you are echoing it makes it sound like they were only living up to their responsibilities as the leader of an entity that cannot exist if he doesn't act in that manner, and they are not guilty for whatever amoral behaviors the adopt in that conquest.

Corporations have a board, and the purpose of the board is to maximize shareholder profit. The board appoints executives. These executives are measured by their ability to maximize shareholder profit. If they fail, the board will replace them, and if they fail consistently, the shareholders will replace board members. This is overly simplified, but it's the basics.\n\nSo when you say \"A 'company' has no 'purpose' other than what is directed by that company's leader\", what you're saying is \"A 'company' has no 'purpose' other than what is directed by its shareholders\". But shareholders are investing for profits- they want stock prices to go up, stocks to split, dividends to be issued, etc. So shareholders are always directing the company to increase profits- there are a million ways to do that, but that's what the executives are in charge of. So the executives are working to increase profits for the shareholders, as appointed by the board, as appointed by the shareholders- the 'leaders'.\n\nCompensating for negative externalities requires regulation and legislative restriction.

Additionally, now we have a situation where we have a SHIT TON of clumped up oil on the seafloor, suffocating the bacteria that is supposed to clean it up. Its like getting coated in mud, and getting in the shower, and wondering why the shower drain backs up. You clogged it, motherfucker. \n\nIts weird, when I was a kid I never understood the hullabaloo about Exxon Valdeez, as in why it was talked about years upon years after the cleanup had ended. As an adult, a Louisiana resident, and just an American who appreciates the natural beauty of our nation, I'm fucking livid. I'd love nothing more than to see anyone involved with the decision to use Corexit put on trial for crimes against the environment. Seriously, put them in jail for injuring the *one planet we have*.\n\nEDIT: I was gilded, apparently!

The next most populist-type politics and followers would be in Argentina, and even they don't subscribe to an \"ism\" the way many Venezuelans do with the whole Revoluci\u00f3n Socialista Bolivariana thing. It could be said that Argentina's politics is covered by a certain nationalism, yes, but it still doesn't come close to the intensity of Venezuela's policy. Frankly, that's just how Argentinians are, and Kirchner and Co. play it.\n\n\nI'm not sure what you're referring to with Colombia at *all*.

Brazil is a whole different kettle of fish, and I could talk about it at length, but it'll make me cranky to do so... Dilma and Lula are and were active supporters of Ch\u00e1vez and Maduro's nationalistic and protectionist economic tendencies, though not to the same extreme, and I think they knew that selling it would mean certain political suicide. Their constituency does not usually have an in-depth knowledge of economics. I realise this will offend many, but PT (Dilma and Lula's party) has a very clear-cut constituency- the most lowly-educated, low-earning part of the population. They buy votes with promises of certain social protections, and ensured increases of minimum wages (in line with inflation and not with any increase in productivity- hence our stagflation). Hell, I saw a campaign sign from Dilma about putting in an extra bus lane in some random bairro. *That's* the level of campaigning they do. Economic matters do not even make up a part of their campaigning- the protectionism of Brazilian industry was never something PT included in their campaign- it's just a result of their government's inability to create a competitive economy due to making it subordinate to highly unsustainable social and labour policy.
