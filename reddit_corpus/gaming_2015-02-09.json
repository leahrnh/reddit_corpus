No doubt they do that kinda easily by having a short list of habitable planets combined with records and  sleeper agents. How they'd find hidden facilities that are off the books I have no idea though (like virmire), I guess they just hope it doesn't happen.

The universe's scope was certainly expansive, but it also felt pretty dull and lifeless.  Sure, you had a million different planets to explore in the Mako, but the missions were all just re-skinned copies of each other.  \n\nSpending 10 minutes struggling to maneuver the Mako across an impossibly rocky world (that looks strikingly similar to the impossibly rocky world you were just on) in order to clear out a pre-fab base full of enemies (that looks striking similar to the pre-fab base full of enemies you just cleared out) didn't make the universe feel alive to me.  It just made it feel padded.\n\nAnd that's all without even mentioning wonky shooting mechanics (which felt unrefined and phoned in) or the god-awful inventory management system (not that that's at all important in an RPG).\n\nNone of which is to say that Mass Effect 1 is a bad game.  But Mass Effect 2 retained the likable characters, compelling story, and excellent writing while refining the actual, you know, *gameplay* into something far more fluid, refined, and fun - even if it didn't revolutionize how 3rd person shooters are played.  \n\nMeanwhile, while there certainly aren't as many planets to explore, the ones that are in the game all feel so much more unique and memorable than just about any of the non-storyline worlds from ME1.\n\nMass Effect 1 provided the template.  But Mass Effect 2 trimmed the fat, fleshed out the core experience, and added a layer of polish that was sorely lacking in its predecessor.  It's basically everything a sequel should be.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh03","qSentId": 24156,"question": "Or like a Leviathan.","aSentId": 24189,"answer": "Yeah I don't think it really looks like a reaper...

Three fourths of the game could be described as a cakewalk and then suddenly the end had a spike of difficulty but nothing you weren't prepared for.  Then it was over.  No sandbox or skirmish mode.

Even the thing about getting an intern to head the team and write the story now is just becoming unnecessarily provocative of the consumer base. \n\nI think that the smugness of responding to people's anger at him is what allows PM and his kin to pull this shit. On the Steam forums, two community managers have quit, the mods are barricaded behind ghost edits and the developers only drop in to pick their battles at rebutting overly-emotional statements.\n\nBut on Reddit, the attitude is markedly different. Godus was released on Kickstarter years ago, not recently, as such it was a time when things like FTL or other solid projects were in full swing. Having a go at someone just because you might have had better informed attitudes will only make sure that these stories of fraudulent behavior don't make it here on Reddit but are instead confined to Steam - which is what PM wants. \n\nThe 22Cans forums are down. Emails are bouncing. They're locking down their hatches. There are really weird shills trying to turf the discussions. Reddit is being judgmental. PM is making paper money banks twenty-twenties.  \n\nThe only reason why he responded with a video and this became a thing is because RPS ran an article on it. Keep that in mind and let PM serve as an example to KS and Steam that this Early Access shit isn't working in its current way.

It was pure convenient coincidence that these articles rolled out today too (which may have been from a tip I sent RPS last week about this buuut who knows). \n\n**Edit:** Something to clarify here: this isn't standard Molyneux hype shit and it's less than what was hyped. This is instead Molyneux presents one thing (i.e. PC version) and backs the fuck off that to push another thing (i.e. mobile freemium version). \n\nThe bullshit technicality he's playing off of is that they mentioned a mobile version at all, but this simply doesn't hold, especially given his use of his legacy to market it (which were all primarily PC titles) at a time when other industry figures (e.g. Tim Schafer, Chris Roberts, etc.) were doing the same. That he seems content to neglect the context in which he was pitching Godus and deny that it was mobile first (and freemium at that) is simply a testament to Molyneux's utterly lacking character. \n\nWhere before you might have said that was obvious, due to the quality of his games never matching up to his hype, here you have a clearly demonstrable case of the quality not even mattering, his behavior and statements speak for themselves. Molyneux's a scummy businessperson first and a charismatic salesperson second, he's only a games person last because that's the suit he stumbled into. It's one thing to sell you on hype, everyone in the entertainment industry tries to do that, but it's another entirely to sell you, say, an Alien prequel then scrap it for a self-contained scifi story like, you know, Prometheus that barely holds together upon scrutiny. \n\nAmusingly enough, Prometheus and Godus have those two things in common, they look nice enough depending on your tastes, but they're severely absent of substance and make you wish they'd stuck to the original pitch more.","aSentId": 25397,"answer": "I was following their updates keenly.

RTD is a special, non-consumable Burn Card that, when in an active slot, will randomly draw another card from your deck every 1:30 and substitute it instead. That card will then be consumed, but the RTD won't draw another one until its timer runs out. So with 3 RTDs you can basically be machine-fed cards at random every time you die, not just 3. Some cards are OP AF, but my understanding is that they were added after launch.

I think this would have been more serviceable if they targeted people who enjoyed pre-GO CS, pre-F2P TF2, and the old guys who liked Quake but feel overwhelmed by the breadth of content newer games have to offer. Basically, people there for the gameplay and not for an endless stream of unlocks. Everything there served its purpose.\n\nYou still can kinda swap scopes and attachments on the guns, giving them different playstyles. My personal favorite (and the one really outlandish option) is to put the 2.4x DMR scope on the LMG - which kicks so bad the dot bounces all the way from the top of the sight to the bottom every shot. Somehow I'm extremely effective with this, much to the buttmad of other players in the lobby.\n\n5 maps and 2 modes seems small, even for launch. You talking about the beta? I know now it's got somewhere around 10 maps with the base game and so many playlists you almost need a scroll wheel to see them all.

The world has changed a lot in the last decade and eSports are one of many new things that were not around a few years ago. Their popularity is rising rapidly and viewing figiures, globally, rival many mainstream sports. I do not see how dedicating yourself (if you can fairly say that, he is 15 and has his whole life ahead of him still) to a game is any different to a person dedicating their life to any other hobby, whether it be another more convential sport or bricklaying. He has found something he is good at and has managed to make good money as a result. It's not about validation of the time you spend doing something. It's about competition. It's about being the best at something. Players were competing in Dota since before prize money was even around. I also can't stress enough how much a new player simply cannot just pick up Dota 2 and be good at it. It is enormously complex and strategic and requires a very serious level of understanding. I also don't see how you could draw the conclusion that it's foolish to play for money. What's foolish is me having a 9-5 where I make a hell of a lot less than this kid!
