If these loans are guaranteed by the person and can't be discharged, that makes them secured loans.\n\nSecured loans should have very low interest rates. Yet we have student loans with 6-13% interest rates that are still protected from bankruptcy.\n\nThat makes no sense.  For a loan to be protected from bankruptcy, it needs to have rates similar to a home loan.(probably even less because you can file bankruptcy to get out of a home loan and clean the slate)  Why do home loans have low rates?  Because the loan is backed by the house so if the person defaults, the bank just sells the house and doesn't lose any money.  House loans therefore have low risk and thus the bank shouldn't be charging a high interest rate.\n\nWhen student loans can't be discharged, that means they are secured in the same way and thus should have low interest rates.  If a person defaults, the bank just garnishes up to 30% of their wages.  The bank won't even try to garnish enough to pay off any principal, they love collecting 13% until you die.  You will pay them back 4-5 times over your lifetime without having the principal drop a single cent.  Then they write off the principal as a gift against your estate so if you have any assets, the government will levy taxes owed against them.  (this is a tax write off for the loan company of 35% of the balance)\n\nA lot of student loans could be paid back if interest rates didn't skyrocket the loan balances over time and balloon debts to the point that a person may pay them off in 60-70 years with their current earning ability.

It's assholes who think they are immune to the consequences of their actions that ruin things for everybody. ", "aSentId": 10168, "answer": "I was in a fraternity at Michigan State for a few semesters, we were in a nearly identical situation.  On a ski weekend trip some of the brothers had absolutely ravaged the place they were staying - luckily (I suppose) it was a smaller trip than the UM one, so the damages were closer to $20,000 as opposed to the ~$400,000 caused in this incident.\n\nDespite that, however, the three brothers that were identified by basically everyone else who was on the trip as being by far the most destructive simply refused to subject themselves to harsher consequences than anyone else who was there.  Everyone knew who they were and what they did but their rationale was that since the other people on the trip failed to stop what was happening they were just as responsible.  Which is, of course, absolutely ridiculous and infantile.\n\nTurns out, the months went by and the $20,000 continued to go unaccounted for.  Semesterly dues were raised for all brothers in an attempt to get at least some of the money paid off, but this - coupled with the aforementioned trio's refusal to pay - simply caused half of the other brothers in the house to just stop paying dues entirely, or to stop paying them on time at the very least.  Two years after the incident Nationals finally stepped in and ordered a chapter review.  Over half the house - myself included - opted to simply move to alumni status because we didn't feel it was fair to have to go through a several-hour interview to prove we belonged in the house that we'd already proved we belonged in.  The remainder of the brothers did go through the review and are now enjoying further increased dues, a half-empty house, and what essentially amounts to a babysitter from Nationals supervising virtually everything that goes on in the house now.  The three brothers responsible for the majority of the damages elected to switch to alumni status but luckily Nationals denied them that priviledge and they were deactivated.\n\nThe best part is, the majority of that stuff happened during my pledge term and the semester prior to it, and of course being pledges we had absolutely no idea what was really going on (the brothers tried to keep it pretty hush-hush, for obvious reasons).  So I got initiated, enjoyed one semester of tremendous tension and rifts between various groups of brothers, and then became an alumni.  It was really sad because when I was a pledge, before shit really hit the fan, things were really great in the house, and we (my pledge class, that is) were the last pledge class to be subjected to the traditional pledge hazing but we never got the opportunity to see it pay off.  (When Nationals came in for the chapter review and heard about the hazing tendencies, suffice to say those ended right fuckin' quick.)\n\nAll of that could have been avoided if those three slapdicks had just manned the fuck up and taken responsibility.  The funny thing about it is that all three of them were from very well-off families and I absolutely guarantee their parents would have contributed to pay off the debt.  They just didn't want to do it because they apparently felt that they really were being discriminated against unfairly.  Fucking ridiculous.

In the UK students are given a student loan which is basically a \u00a31100 lump sum up in 3 instalments over the year.

These people are being 'enabled' by the government.\n\nThe 'well off' kids who aren't given money are then the ones who 'suffer' (ie. have to get a part-time job or take out a bank loan), especially those in families who had multiple kids etc but earned above a certain amount. But I digress. The point is most kids are flush with cash to party etc. Some more than others, but the average 'well off' student and the average 'bursary student' probably had comparable amounts. People were rarely twats (and definitely not to this level), but when people were obnoxious / entitled, it wasn't because they were from well-off backgrounds. \n\nAnyway, this isn't really why I made my post - it's more because it appears to be constantly assumed that a majority of well off kids who are fortunate enough to not have to bust their asses off are self-entitled.

Africa is so massive that it's hard to get trade goods to the interior, through all of the different tribes. They also have a very low population density there, contributing to the existence of many separate factional groups rather than one dominant one (like the Han Chinese). Central Asia is poor for similar reasons - too far from the ocean for cheap trade, inadequate fresh water supply, and thus a low population density. \n\nI think the Persians and Arabs would also probably be a lot more successful if not for their religion.

I really hope you don't think that people hating you because you're a \"perceived social standing\" is a high school mentality. That's just life. \n\n&gt; Let's be real\n\nOk. Fraternities are about the connections. The only reason they matter is so that you can go to college and do all the mindless initiation and rites of passage, and then come out making more money than everyone else who didn't do them.

Underage drinking for example doesn't suddenly only become a problem when someone in a frat or sorority does it.

They raise more money for charity on average than anyone else on campus and are the largest network of volunteers in the US.\n\nAs for the connections thing, people make it out like you're gonna join a fraternity and magically get a job out of it. That's not true. Most freshman who join aren't thinking about job connections. What do you think is in it for guys who join new fraternity chapters that have no alumni to help them out with jobs? When I rushed I rushed because I wanted to become involved on campus and I met a group of guys who were welcoming to me and who I really liked. I realized that if I joined their organization I could meet people and make friends as well as get involved in the chapter's other endeavors. \n\nAs for saying negative things about people who aren't in the group, most of the frats on my campus don't treat unaffiliated students negatively or any differently aside from maybe a couple of groups of guys with big egos (who are the minority in our Greek community). Believe me, we get a lot more unwarranted shit for being IN the organizations than anyone gets for not being in one. \n\nAs for the traditions, they are part of what separates us from simply being a club. We hold them dear to us as a part of our identity, and they certainly aren't mindless. Some of my most unique and meaningful experiences have been related to fraternity traditions - specifically the ritual, which I consider a privilege to have seen and be involved with every semester. \n\nI understand why news stories like this, and personal negative experiences with fraternities can be off putting to people, but I will still oppose hating or judging people you've never met based on their membership in a social organization.

To state that rather than it being a problem with fringe groups it is instead a problem with the entire structure in general is, in my mind at least, a very large generalization that doesn't take in the facts of the matter.\n\nTo be honest, each chapter of each fraternity is different, so it is impossible to generalize them all as bad.  I joined a fraternity last semester at my University and can speak first hand as to how each one truly is different from the rest.  We have multiple fraternities on campus, and each serve a different purpose so to say.  We have the cliche party frat full of douchebags that everyone on campus hates.  We have the frat that is known for its partying who everyone tends to get along with.  We have my frat, who are most known to be laid back and somewhat charity oriented.  We have the 'snooty' frat full of the rich kids.  We have the cliche sorority full of bitchy girls who will only fuck you if you wear letters.  We also have a sorority full of some of the sweetest girls I've ever met.  The list goes on for both sides, and it is hard to keep track of what each frat and sorority are like.  To assume that all of the greek life is secretly evil and party centric is a damn brash generalization in my mind.\n\nThe thing you have to remember is that all people are different in the end.

Most kids can't have these types of parties because it would be too expensive to pay for alone. When you have 70-100 guys + their dates + 1000's of dollars in alcohol and drugs fucked up shit is bound to happen. I'm not saying fraternities aren't to blame, but the system as whole isn't broken or a problem. There are a lot of Greek Chapters out there who do a lot of good and don't get into trouble. It has a lot to do with the Chapters leadership. Often times there will be new executive board at the beginning of each year/semester depending on the organization.

Both are designed to protect someone - teachers and defendants, respectively. For the justice system, people get pissed off that 'obviously guilty' people use this to avoid getting prosecuted.\n\nThis brings us to the philosophical question - what is more important? Currently we can't design a system that is perfect in catching only those who are guilty, so we're left with (broadly) to options: a system that catches all the guilty people and some innocent people or a system that catches some of the guilty and none of the innocent.\n\nObviously this isn't a perfect world so regardless of which we pick, some guilty will go free and some innocent will get caught in the crossfire. \"It is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer\" This is the basis of our legal system, to a large extent. The teacher's union is also the same - protect the innocent at the cost of protecting the guilty occasionally. The union is designed to protect teachers and give them bargaining power so they can be treated fairly and not eliminated because \"well he's a guy teaching kindergarten!\" and other bullshit.\n\nFor firing a teacher, the idea with the union is that you have to jump through the hoops that ENSURE the firing was done for good reason and not just because someone dislikes a teacher or other invalid reason. Sadly, I feel this idea has been corrupted to a certain extent because it's apparently near-impossible to fire a teacher for violations as absurd and obvious as this. This drags us to a new issue - how do you get the union to reform its policies on firing a teacher? You're asking the union to give up power they fought for and asking them to trust everyone to not abuse lesser regulation on firing and ONLY use them to get rid of problem teachers. If someone at your job asked if you were okay that they make it easier to fire you so they could get rid of problem employees in your field, would you feel better that your coworkers would be more competent or feel less safe because it'd be easier to fire you? Most would feel less safe not happy that they're trimming the dead weight.\n\nThat's the real issue - how do we make a system to evaluate and fire grossly incompetent teachers while giving that system oversight to ensure that good, innocent teachers are protected from the same system? And once designed, how do we convince the union to accept it? If you can figure those issues out, you should seriously be getting involved with government education agencies or teachers unions to fix this mess - they could use your help!

According to a Midrash, the Torah was created prior to the creation of the world, and was used as the blueprint for Creation.[3] The majority of Biblical scholars believe that the written books were a product of the Babylonian exilic period (c. 600 BCE) and that it was completed by the Persian period (c. 400 BCE).[4]\n\nLots of possibilities there.\n\nWho wrote the Gospels?  When?  We really aren't sure.  Are all the 'letters of Paul' really written by Paul, or even the same person?\n\nEven if we had exact names and dates for every book of the Bible, nothing in terms of 'scholarly research' can ever prove that their words are divinely inspired or perfectly correct.

I'm not saying they do - I've never heard of this happening before.\n\nThat District Attorneys refuse to prosecute, and that sentencing judges assign lesser sentences, to police officers who have committed criminal acts, is a wholly different matter. \n\nI don't know why you are sarcastically repeating my differentiation of a police officer and a non-police officer, as if it is some sort of insult or description of superiority/inferiority, when it is literally just a differentiation, for the purpose of clarity in my post - to more clearly explain when I'm referring to someone who is a police officer, versus when I'm referring to someone who is not a police officer.\n\nSimilar to if we were discussing race, I would make it a point to note race in my posts, to ensure I was communicating clearly.\n\nAs for assuming the action will be seen as inappropriate [by individuals who are not police officers] - are you asserting that this is not the case, in a significant number of cases?\n\nWhy do I stipulate 'by individuals who are not police officers' in the above question, I'm sure you'll bring up.\n\nBecause if there's an officer-involved shooting, where a suspect was shot and killed - say, someone running at the officer with a knife, or driving a vehicle at an officer, or being of significantly larger physical stature and menacingly approaching a smaller/weaker officer or cornering them, even if unarmed.\n\nThe common perception is that many, if not all, of these are unjustified. Why not shoot the weapon out of their hands? Why not shoot them in the leg or shoulder? Why not tase them or pepper spray them?\n\nThese are questions asked out of ignorance of how these different levels of force work, and when/how they are properly employed.\n\nFor instance, in the first example - you have an individual apparently attempting to charge you with a lethal weapon, presumably with the intent of seriously injuring or killing the officer with that lethal weapon. Lethal force is an appropriate response to lethal force. Yes, there are other factors that can complicate this particular situation, but generally speaking, this would be an appropriate response. \n\nAs for shooting them to wound/disable, or shooting the weapon out of their hands - I can see from your posting history that you seem to be reasonably familiar with firearms, so I'm hoping you can understand how foolish these suggestions are. If not, I can explain.\n\nWhy not tase or pepper spray them? The margin of error is too great - if one or both of the prongs fail to hit the target, or if the individual is wearing clothing that prevents them from making effective contact, the Taser is worthless. Pepper spray is a chemical irritant - while it sucks, it hurts, and it causes tearing up, it does not prevent you from charging someone, tackling someone, and stabbing someone. People also can have a complete or near-complete immunity to pepper spray, be it because of a physiological abnormality, or because of the influence of any number of drugs or chemicals in the body. Furthermore, pepper spray has a very limited range, ability to effectively aim, and does not have an incapacitating effect. \n\nWhy not use the officer's baton, or unarmed self defense techniques? The individual is attacking the officer with a lethal weapon, and it is not reasonable or appropriate to *expect* the officer to respond with unarmed fighting techniques, or with what amounts to a small club. Thankfully for the sake of preserving life, it does happen effectively from time to time, but it is not effective enough to be considered an appropriate response to the situation.\n\nThe safest and best option left to this officer is to counter this attempt to injure or kill them with lethal force - A taser may miss or not work, pepper spray won't work *enough*...Incapacitation by virtue of high-speed metal projectiles is significantly more reliable and effectively employed, to eliminate a threat.\n\nAnd that's all the officer is doing - eliminating a threat. The unfortunate reality of this is that the best way to eliminate a threat, when using a firearm, is to aim center-mass - it is the biggest, most easily hit target, and it is the target with the best chance of halting the attacker. Is it preferred that the attacker survive their injuries - if indeed they are incapacitated? Absolutely. But it's also very likely that they won't. The officer is not 'aiming to kill' or 'trying to kill' the attacker - the officer is trying to *stop* the attacker, and unfortunately the two are accomplished in essentially the same manner.\n\nThe second example - driving a vehicle at an officer. A vehicle, when used as a weapon, is a lethal weapon - it can easily kill or cause severe and serious injury. Why not just jump out of the way? The suspect driving the vehicle wasn't *trying* to hit the officer, after all, they were just trying to get away! \n\nIf jumping out of the way is an option, then there's room to do so, and other factors must be explored to see if this is a justified use of force - was the individual appearing to actively aim for the officer? Was the individual previously acting in an aggressive and resistant manner? Are there any other factors that would cause the officer to reasonably come to the immediate conclusion that lethal force was the best and most effective solution to the situation?\n\nIf jumping out of the way is *not* an option, then, again - we have an office being charged at by a person with a lethal weapon, even if that person 'did not intend to harm the officer, but was just trying to get away'. The officer is taking reasonable steps to eliminate a threat before he is grievously injured or killed by this suspects intentional or incidental attack.\n\nThe third example - a suspect with significantly larger physical stature, or even known to be exceptionally skilled in unarmed combat. It can very easily be reasoned that an unarmed attack from an individual could be lethal force. Is it much more likely, and much more preferred, that the officer, in this situation, employ less-than-lethal measures to halt the attacker? Absolutely. But, again, this is not always feasible. Perhaps this individual is charging the officer, like above - the same difficulties would apply. Perhaps this officer works in a department where they are not provided with appropriate less-than-lethal tools. Perhaps this individual is so close that we essentially run into the same issues, anyway. It's less likely that this would end up being a justified use of lethal force, but it is not at all impossible.\n\nThese are all things that the majority of people who aren't police officers consider or realize - and it boils down to, much like anywhere else in life, outside and ignorant observers armchair quarterbacking what should have been done or could have been done, often with extreme ignorance, unfounded conclusions, and poor assumptions of the particulars involved.\n\nAs for no reports being available until the investigation ends - this is the case with *any* criminal investigation. If I'm investigating someone's car being keyed, or if I'm investigating a murder...Details are not to be released to the public until the investigation has concluded. It is irrelevant if the alleged subject in that investigation is a police officer. \n\n'Not saying anything bad about another officer' - no, because doing so without grounds for such utterances is unprofessional, inappropriate, and possibly even subject to criminal or civil action. Just as much as it would be to say bad things about someone who is not a police officer.\n\nI fully understand what 'non police officer' rights are - they're the exact same as police officer rights.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3l", "qSentId": 13458, "question": "I don't understand why the unions' stance is protect at all costs no matter the facts.

That's like saying, \"What's so hard about building a rocket? You just do it. Simple.\"\n\nNo. There are a large number of people involved in dismissing a police officer for misconduct.\n\nHis supervisor(s) must appropriately document and reprimand him for this misconduct (If they are even made aware of it), to start with. This is difficult, because a poorly performing officer can easily be reassigned to another precinct, another section, or otherwise placed under a different supervisor. In the interest of impartiality, this new supervisor will often let this officer start 'with a clean slate'. Until their misconduct starts up again, and this supervisor annotates it and reports it appropriately...And then *his* supervisor recommends reassignment, *again*.

Scaled and escalating disciplinary action. Event-oriented re-training (You used excessive force? Ok, we'll re-teach you what appropriate use of force is).\n\nThe officer continues to engage in misconduct or other unsatisfactory behavior. Let's skip past all the times when he's given more rehabilitative reassignments or minor disciplinary/corrective action - because, hey, maybe it's been several months, or even years and multiple job positions since his last incident. But let's assume we're immediately escalating to the next step.\n\nAt this point, there's likely a pretty cut-and-dry mandated suspension, perhaps while an Internal Affairs investigation is conducted. This suspension will probably be with pay, because, again, Union and Department policy, and giving the officer the benefit of the doubt and presumption of innocence.\n\nIA concludes that there was no *provable* misconduct. This doesn't mean the officer acted appropriately, it just means that the *allegation of inappropriate conduct cannot be conclusively proven*.\n\nSo the officer is allowed to return from suspension, and resume normal duties. Possibly with another rehabilitative reassignment or corrective training, but, again, let's skip past that.\n\nThis happens a few more times. Presumption of innocence - which is the standard for the United States the last time I checked - reigns supreme, and, again, Internal Affairs, or even external agencies, can't *prove* misconduct. And, hey, why not give the officer the benefit of the doubt? Can you really conclusively say, with no legitimate proof, that any or *all* of these allegations are true? Sure, there's a lot of coincidence in that he's so frequently complained about, but coincidence doesn't prove anything.\n\nBut, ok, he finally fucks up again. Much worse this time. Now he's suspended without pay, and Internal Affairs can prove he actually did something wrong. Maybe he's charged, maybe he's not. That's up to a District Attorney, not the cop's supervisors. \n\nLet's say he's not, because what DA or city/county/state wants to drag their department's name through the mud - and presenting the image of not having their officers' backs - over something as relatively inconsequential as whatever Officer Jackass did.\n\nSo, he's reprimanded. Maybe he's demoted. Maybe he's given additional punitive suspension without pay. Maybe he's given a punitive reassignment.\n\nLet's move on, again. Time passes, more alleged incidents and actual incidents occur. Finally, it's something as severe as last time. The department is done with this guy, they're going to cut sling load on him, and drop him like third period French.\n\nBut here comes the Union. \"No,\" they say, \"You can't fire Officer Jackass. Because [Insert reason here].\" \n\nWhat's that reason? Who knows. Allegation that he's the target of a vendetta of his superiors, allegation that he's simply not been properly supervised or trained, allegation that IA was biased and conducted an improper investigation, threats of exerting political pressure or using their influence with the rest of the police officers for that department to make things difficult for the department leadership. Any number of things. \n\nSo the Department backs down. And they suspend him without pay, again. Or, hey, maybe with pay this time, because the tongue-lashing the Union gave them left them smarting a little.\n\nSo, come a few Mondays later, Officer Jackass is back with the force. Doing what he does.\n\nUntil one day, after god knows how many times through this circus, he finally pisses off enough people, or does something so severe that it cannot be overlooked, and he's dismissed or forced to resign or retire. He's probably not charged, because, again - Union pressure, and the very real effect it might have on the trust and performance of their good officers (You know, the other 90-95% of the force).\n\nAnd all of this is assuming he doesn't have a poker buddy, or an uncle, or a cousin, or a dad, or a friend, or someone he went to the Academy with, or what-the-hell-ever, in a position of power - whether they be simply rich and influential, a politician, another higher ranking member of the department or governing body, whatever.\n\nThis is, too, not accounting for the very strict damage control - in the interest of public image, as well as in the interest of the presumption of innocence of the officer - regarding the incidents the officer was involved in. This is going to cause the vast majority of his peers to not have a clue what he's done, or even if he's done anything, and it gives him and his friends and supporters plenty of opportunity to spin the public opinion (Within the department's rank-and-file) in favor of Officer Jackass.\n\nThat damage control and favorable opinion, is going to cause other officers to overlook, out of ignorance of the totality of the circumstances, what would otherwise be relatively minor and inconsequential infractions. Something that his partner or coworker, Officer Lightyear (First name 'Buzz') corrects with a, \"Dude, Officer Jackass...You can't do that. That's just not OK,\" rather than reporting it to their superiors to be the final nail in Officer Jackass's coffin - because, hey, as far as Officer Lightyear knows, Officer Jackass just made a small error in judgement, or got a little overzealous in the heat of the moment - he's not a bad guy.\n\nIt's not as simple as \"They're a bad apple?

Throw them out,\" in the world of law enforcement, any more than it is anywhere else.\n\n&gt; Got a bad cop? Let them go. Simple.\n\nExcept it's not that simple. That's like saying, \"What's so hard about building a rocket? You just do it. Simple.\"\n\nNo. There are a large number of people involved in dismissing a police officer for misconduct.\n\nHis supervisor(s) must appropriately document and reprimand him for this misconduct (If they are even made aware of it), to start with. This is difficult, because a poorly performing officer can easily be reassigned to another precinct, another section, or otherwise placed under a different supervisor. In the interest of impartiality, this new supervisor will often let this officer start 'with a clean slate'. Until their misconduct starts up again, and this supervisor annotates it and reports it appropriately...And then *his* supervisor recommends reassignment, *again*. Wash, rinse, repeat.\n\nBut, you know, say that all of these complaints of misconduct are substantiated (Rather than empty cries of racism because the officer ticketed someone of a different race, or police brutality because an officer was forced to taze or pepper spray someone), properly reported, and properly documented.\n\nThen there's the, undoubtedly Union- and Department-mandated attempt to correct the officer's behavior. Scaled and escalating disciplinary action. Event-oriented re-training (You used excessive force? Ok, we'll re-teach you what appropriate use of force is).\n\nThe officer continues to engage in misconduct or other unsatisfactory behavior. Let's skip past all the times when he's given more rehabilitative reassignments or minor disciplinary/corrective action - because, hey, maybe it's been several months, or even years and multiple job positions since his last incident. But let's assume we're immediately escalating to the next step.\n\nAt this point, there's likely a pretty cut-and-dry mandated suspension, perhaps while an Internal Affairs investigation is conducted. This suspension will probably be with pay, because, again, Union and Department policy, and giving the officer the benefit of the doubt and presumption of innocence.\n\nIA concludes that there was no *provable* misconduct. This doesn't mean the officer acted appropriately, it just means that the *allegation of inappropriate conduct cannot be conclusively proven*.\n\nSo the officer is allowed to return from suspension, and resume normal duties. Possibly with another rehabilitative reassignment or corrective training, but, again, let's skip past that.\n\nThis happens a few more times. Presumption of innocence - which is the standard for the United States the last time I checked - reigns supreme, and, again, Internal Affairs, or even external agencies, can't *prove* misconduct. And, hey, why not give the officer the benefit of the doubt? Can you really conclusively say, with no legitimate proof, that any or *all* of these allegations are true? Sure, there's a lot of coincidence in that he's so frequently complained about, but coincidence doesn't prove anything.\n\nBut, ok, he finally fucks up again. Much worse this time. Now he's suspended without pay, and Internal Affairs can prove he actually did something wrong. Maybe he's charged, maybe he's not. That's up to a District Attorney, not the cop's supervisors. \n\nLet's say he's not, because what DA or city/county/state wants to drag their department's name through the mud - and presenting the image of not having their officers' backs - over something as relatively inconsequential as whatever Officer Jackass did.\n\nSo, he's reprimanded. Maybe he's demoted. Maybe he's given additional punitive suspension without pay. Maybe he's given a punitive reassignment.\n\nLet's move on, again. Time passes, more alleged incidents and actual incidents occur. Finally, it's something as severe as last time. The department is done with this guy, they're going to cut sling load on him, and drop him like third period French.\n\nBut here comes the Union. \"No,\" they say, \"You can't fire Officer Jackass. Because [Insert reason here].\" \n\nWhat's that reason? Who knows. Allegation that he's the target of a vendetta of his superiors, allegation that he's simply not been properly supervised or trained, allegation that IA was biased and conducted an improper investigation, threats of exerting political pressure or using their influence with the rest of the police officers for that department to make things difficult for the department leadership. Any number of things. \n\nSo the Department backs down. And they suspend him without pay, again. Or, hey, maybe with pay this time, because the tongue-lashing the Union gave them left them smarting a little.\n\nSo, come a few Mondays later, Officer Jackass is back with the force. Doing what he does.\n\nUntil one day, after god knows how many times through this circus, he finally pisses off enough people, or does something so severe that it cannot be overlooked, and he's dismissed or forced to resign or retire. He's probably not charged, because, again - Union pressure, and the very real effect it might have on the trust and performance of their good officers (You know, the other 90-95% of the force).\n\nAnd all of this is assuming he doesn't have a poker buddy, or an uncle, or a cousin, or a dad, or a friend, or someone he went to the Academy with, or what-the-hell-ever, in a position of power - whether they be simply rich and influential, a politician, another higher ranking member of the department or governing body, whatever.\n\nThis is, too, not accounting for the very strict damage control - in the interest of public image, as well as in the interest of the presumption of innocence of the officer - regarding the incidents the officer was involved in. This is going to cause the vast majority of his peers to not have a clue what he's done, or even if he's done anything, and it gives him and his friends and supporters plenty of opportunity to spin the public opinion (Within the department's rank-and-file) in favor of Officer Jackass.\n\nThat damage control and favorable opinion, is going to cause other officers to overlook, out of ignorance of the totality of the circumstances, what would otherwise be relatively minor and inconsequential infractions.

There is perhaps some truth in that, but the more realistic versions is that the unions are providing a general level of legal representation and the school districts are not given the money and resources to push for a termination in cases where the evidence is not sufficient to avoid a court case.\n\nI knew of a teacher who had some girls file sexual harassment claims against him... while the school was busy negotiating an earlier set of sexual harassment charges (these things, by law, need to be handled in private... but... small towns...). While it was \"well known\" that he'd done it, he refused to let them fire him without a formal complaint, and a formal complaint would open them up to a court case over whether it was justified or not. Instead, he was given a \"leave of absence\" and during his leave, his position was \"reduced\" only to be reopened a year later.\n\nBecause he wasn't fired, he was still eligible for pension, but the school decided that it was more important to get him out of the school than to let him spend the next two years harassing more girls while the courts fought over whether the testimony of a fifteen year old could be trusted.\n\nSo yeah... crappy stuff happens.

Adrenaline is a hell of a drug and basically unless the shot does enough damage that they cannot physically move (like destroying a bone in the leg), they won't go down. The human body is incredibly adept at suppressing pain and anyone confronting a cop is probably already full of adrenaline before they are even shot. The lower lethality is irrelevant because it can still kill and it doesn't incapacitate. It fails the two things it is meant to do... it doesn't ensure survival and it doesn't remove the threat\n\n2. It could be a threat to someone other than the officer. Also, try this... extend your arm straight out, then move it 90 degrees as fast as you can... fractions of a second and the only part that is in the same spot is likely your shoulder. Or go watch someone running. Aiming takes time, if someone is running at you, you don't have the time to hit arms or legs, they are constantly moving and they're targets that on a really big person are a few inches across, an expert marksman couldn't guarantee making that shot even without the high stress situation... and if it fails to hit or incapacitate, you just missed your only chance to effectively subdue the threat. \n\n3.

Bob sat down in a chair, also carved of wood, which also came from trees God created. He opened up his computer, made of materials God had made and making use of electricity which God had invented and which man, using the mind God had blessed them with, had figured out how to make into a computer.\n\nBob opened up his Reddit page, and was able to speak with other users, all of whom used similar chairs and computers which came from things God had made. Then Bob logged into r/atheism and made a post entitled: \"God is an Evil Misogynistic Bully and a Maniac and Christians are Stupid for believing in Him.\" He wrote: \"God sends people to hell. Plus he ordained wars in Old Testament. That proves he's evil.\" Everyone sang his praise and said \"Well done Bob. What an intelligent and enlightening post. God is clearly a genocidal maniac for telling people to go to war\"; they did this by typing on their computers, which came from things God had made. An hour later Bob saw that America was going to war with ISIS in the news. \"I'm proud to be American,\" he said, \"they fight against the bad guys.\"\n\nBob wrote \"The Charlie Hebdo cartoonists are heroes of free speech for not worrying about whether they offend the religious.\" An hour later he heard a Jamaican song with lyrics making fun of homosexuals. \"What disgusting homophobic bigotry!\" He cried, \"these lyricists should be arrested.\" As usual his fellow atheists all agreed.\n\nBob also posted depictions of the crucified Messiah to hold them up to the general laughter and mockery of that sacrilegious bunch. Later on in the day Bob noticed a Christian comment: \"When it's so obvious God exists, why do people insist on being atheist?\" Bob said: \"Prove it.\" The Christian made the usual arguments- everything pointed to an intelligent creator. Bob laughed at this. \"That doesn't prove anything. Even if there is a God he is obviously evil.\" The Christian spoke about how he had once been an atheist himself, but decided to pray to God one day, and God had answered him by giving him a sign. It was only a feather with one side white and the other black which his sister had found in a wood and given him: some days earlier the Christian had said: \"Look God, if you exist, just give me a sign. Anything. Give me a feather. White, black, I don't care. Give me a feather.\"\n\nBob laughed at this: \"What a retard. Look, a feather! That proves god exists! This is just the kind of idiotic logic that gets in the way of science. And by the way, science disproves God, so get educated\" and provided him with a link to some site that provided information on evolution. All the atheists praised this as an intelligent and enlightened response. So the debate went on, and Bob dismissed everything the Christian said as either coincidence, a lie, or a delusion. Finally the Christian said: \"Just pray to God. Just try it. Ask him to come into your heart. The Bible says \"seek and you shall find.\" Bob refused. Nevertheless when the debate ended Bob couldn't help feeling a little uncomfortable over the next few days about some of the things the Christian had said. What if there was a God? What if there was a hell? If there was Bob knew that he would be going there. \"Alright,\" Bob said to himself, \"I will prove God doesn't exist! God, if you answer, that proves you're God. If you don't, then it's your fault I don't believe in you. Give me ten billion dollars before I finish speaking, and also have me made president.\" Five seconds later Bob said: \"Well, God didn't answer my prayer. That proves God doesn't exist.\"\n\nFrom then on Bob became more confident in his atheism. He began to type things like: \"If God exists, may he kill me right now.\" Then he would wait until the next day, and reply under it: \"Still alive. Obviously God is weak and also a fool.\" This joke always amused the atheists. Whenever a Christian said \"ask God to come into your heart\", Bob could now say: \"Oh yeah? Well I did pray, and was sincere, but got no answer. Clearly, God doesn't exist. And if he does, I haven't seen any evidence for it, so it's his fault I don't believe in him.\" God never struck Bob dead like Bob constantly asked him to do; Bob grew fat and merry on all the blessings God poured into his lap rather than punishing him... but this only made Bob ridicule God all the more. One day Bob's 90-year-old grandmother passed away and some Christians said \"she went to heaven\", but Bob said: \"If God existed, this proves that he is a tyrant!\" Overall, Bob lived a long, happy life, coming peacefully to his deathbed at the ripe old age of 88, and as he began to pass away he lost his voice and ability to communicate. Suddenly there appeared to him in the room, standing behind his family, a hideous man with a face like the face of the Devil. He came up to Bob. None of Bob's relatives seemed to notice this figure- he was invisible to all except Bob.\n\nThe demon began to mock: \"Why are you so afraid? Why do you sweat? Haven't you said all your life that science disproves us? I am the one who whispered into your ear and led you into the life of being an atheist: I am the one who robbed you of your salvation. Soon you will die. Then I will bring you to hell, you moron, and we'll see whether it exists or not!\" Bob wanted to scream, but he could only let out the faintest, most quiet groan. \"Go on! Tell them what you see! Warn them! Aww, you can't. You can't because you're too weak and pathetic to even speak, though you spoke a lot before. Soon you will go to hell, and burn for all eternity and all time, each day worse than the last, forever: burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn!\" \n\nBob passed away, the last thing he heard was \"burn\", and although he died in horror and terror, it didn't show on his face; his family said he passed peacefully. \"I may be an atheist,\" his daughter said, \"but I still like to think of dad as watching over us from above, smiling.\"\n\nBob was dragged down to hell, then Satan himself came to him: \"Well done, servant.\" Bob, somewhere among his confused and contorted screams and sobs blurted out something that might have been: \"but I never believed in you...\" Satan: \"And I will punish you for it. But you did what I wanted, and that makes you my servant. Don't believe me? Well then I will prove it. Here is your scientific evidence...\" then Satan suddenly sprang forward and raped him. Bob was no longer a brave, proud atheist boasting about how intelligent he was and making fun of crucifixions, making clever comments while surrounded and pampered by his atheist peers: now he was a pathetic, begging, weeping, squirming, panicking child, and as Bob winced and cried and screamed, the devil shouted into his ear: \"This is how I will show you that you are in my power! Do you want more scientific evidence to prove it?\" ; \"no more! Please no more!\" However Satan only roared: \"You are not yet properly convinced! You must have more!\" and Bob let out a scream and a moan of tortured humiliation as the devil became unimaginably more vicious, his nails scratching Bob's eyes.\n\nEventually Satan had done, and Bob lay white and shaking on the rock, too wrecked to move or to speak, only whimper like a dog. But it did not end there: Satan now handed him over to some demons and Bob let out a new wail of despair that rang out anew as he was violated again. As they brutally gang-raped him they shouted: \"What's wrong, Bob? It doesn't exist! You're only dreaming! And what a nightmare! Preach your science to us, Bob! Tell us about how clever you are for being an atheist- yes, we all deeply respect how clever you are! And we want to hear what you have to say!\" if Bob whimpered and screamed they would beat him viciously and furiously and demand that he speak, and yet if Bob managed to wail in a shaky, pig-like squeal: \"S-s-science! N-no s-such th-thing as h-hell!\" the demons only became even more angry and offended than ever; and if Bob shouted: \"I confess! You exist!\" it only made them worse: \"The little f@ggot thinks we will stop because he confesses? What, Bob? Do you think we are your slaves, to stop because you tell us to? What an insult! We'll teach you a lesson for treating us like that!\" In his horror, Bob shouted: \"Oh, Jesus!\" ... That was a mistake; the worst thing Bob could have done. No sooner had the name of Christ left his lips than the demons screamed, frothed, gone rabid in absolute fury, and became twice as terrible as they had been before, taking it as a personal insult: so he was raped again for several hours more.\n\nThe torture continued until long after Bob was already utterly traumatised and completely broken, and then at last he was cast into the lake of fire like that rag doll of a raped, bleeding, traumatised, atheist f@ggot-whore that he was, and knew torments there that he had never imagined could exist- not even while he was being raped. Bob shouted: \"This proves God is evil! It's God's fault I didn't believe because HE DIDN'T GIVE ME EVIDENCE!!\" As he shouted these things, he heard someone shouting similar, and recognized the voice of none other than good old Christopher Hitchens! So they both shouted together, but, as you can imagine, neither of them take any comfort in these words. Well, Bob kept shouting \"this proves God is evil!\" and \"this is all God's fault!\" along with his relatives... and when all the other silly atheists come to join him there, they all shout much the same, but no one ever pays them much mind.\n\n...

He opened up his computer, made of materials God had made and making use of electricity which God had invented and which man, using the mind God had blessed them with, had figured out how to make into a computer.\n\nBob opened up his Reddit page, and was able to speak with other users, all of whom used similar chairs and computers which came from things God had made. Then Bob logged into r/atheism and made a post entitled: \"God is an Evil Misogynistic Bully and a Maniac and Christians are Stupid for believing in Him.\" He wrote: \"God sends people to hell. Plus he ordained wars in Old Testament. That proves he's evil.\" Everyone sang his praise and said \"Well done Bob. What an intelligent and enlightening post. God is clearly a genocidal maniac for telling people to go to war\"; they did this by typing on their computers, which came from things God had made. An hour later Bob saw that America was going to war with ISIS in the news. \"I'm proud to be American,\" he said, \"they fight against the bad guys.\"\n\nBob wrote \"The Charlie Hebdo cartoonists are heroes of free speech for not worrying about whether they offend the religious.\" An hour later he heard a Jamaican song with lyrics making fun of homosexuals. \"What disgusting homophobic bigotry!\" He cried, \"these lyricists should be arrested.\" As usual his fellow atheists all agreed.\n\nBob also posted depictions of the crucified Messiah to hold them up to the general laughter and mockery of that sacrilegious bunch. Later on in the day Bob noticed a Christian comment: \"When it's so obvious God exists, why do people insist on being atheist?\" Bob said: \"Prove it.\" The Christian made the usual arguments- everything pointed to an intelligent creator. Bob laughed at this. \"That doesn't prove anything. Even if there is a God he is obviously evil.\" The Christian spoke about how he had once been an atheist himself, but decided to pray to God one day, and God had answered him by giving him a sign. It was only a feather with one side white and the other black which his sister had found in a wood and given him: some days earlier the Christian had said: \"Look God, if you exist, just give me a sign. Anything. Give me a feather. White, black, I don't care. Give me a feather.\"\n\nBob laughed at this: \"What a retard. Look, a feather! That proves god exists! This is just the kind of idiotic logic that gets in the way of science. And by the way, science disproves God, so get educated\" and provided him with a link to some site that provided information on evolution. All the atheists praised this as an intelligent and enlightened response. So the debate went on, and Bob dismissed everything the Christian said as either coincidence, a lie, or a delusion. Finally the Christian said: \"Just pray to God. Just try it. Ask him to come into your heart. The Bible says \"seek and you shall find.\" Bob refused. Nevertheless when the debate ended Bob couldn't help feeling a little uncomfortable over the next few days about some of the things the Christian had said. What if there was a God? What if there was a hell? If there was Bob knew that he would be going there. \"Alright,\" Bob said to himself, \"I will prove God doesn't exist! God, if you answer, that proves you're God. If you don't, then it's your fault I don't believe in you. Give me ten billion dollars before I finish speaking, and also have me made president.\" Five seconds later Bob said: \"Well, God didn't answer my prayer. That proves God doesn't exist.\"\n\nFrom then on Bob became more confident in his atheism. He began to type things like: \"If God exists, may he kill me right now.\" Then he would wait until the next day, and reply under it: \"Still alive. Obviously God is weak and also a fool.\" This joke always amused the atheists. Whenever a Christian said \"ask God to come into your heart\", Bob could now say: \"Oh yeah? Well I did pray, and was sincere, but got no answer. Clearly, God doesn't exist. And if he does, I haven't seen any evidence for it, so it's his fault I don't believe in him.\" God never struck Bob dead like Bob constantly asked him to do; Bob grew fat and merry on all the blessings God poured into his lap rather than punishing him... but this only made Bob ridicule God all the more. One day Bob's 90-year-old grandmother passed away and some Christians said \"she went to heaven\", but Bob said: \"If God existed, this proves that he is a tyrant!\" Overall, Bob lived a long, happy life, coming peacefully to his deathbed at the ripe old age of 88, and as he began to pass away he lost his voice and ability to communicate. Suddenly there appeared to him in the room, standing behind his family, a hideous man with a face like the face of the Devil. He came up to Bob. None of Bob's relatives seemed to notice this figure- he was invisible to all except Bob.\n\nThe demon began to mock: \"Why are you so afraid? Why do you sweat? Haven't you said all your life that science disproves us? I am the one who whispered into your ear and led you into the life of being an atheist: I am the one who robbed you of your salvation. Soon you will die. Then I will bring you to hell, you moron, and we'll see whether it exists or not!\" Bob wanted to scream, but he could only let out the faintest, most quiet groan. \"Go on! Tell them what you see! Warn them! Aww, you can't. You can't because you're too weak and pathetic to even speak, though you spoke a lot before. Soon you will go to hell, and burn for all eternity and all time, each day worse than the last, forever: burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn!\" \n\nBob passed away, the last thing he heard was \"burn\", and although he died in horror and terror, it didn't show on his face; his family said he passed peacefully. \"I may be an atheist,\" his daughter said, \"but I still like to think of dad as watching over us from above, smiling.\"\n\nBob was dragged down to hell, then Satan himself came to him: \"Well done, servant.\" Bob, somewhere among his confused and contorted screams and sobs blurted out something that might have been: \"but I never believed in you...\" Satan: \"And I will punish you for it. But you did what I wanted, and that makes you my servant. Don't believe me? Well then I will prove it. Here is your scientific evidence...\" then Satan suddenly sprang forward and raped him. Bob was no longer a brave, proud atheist boasting about how intelligent he was and making fun of crucifixions, making clever comments while surrounded and pampered by his atheist peers: now he was a pathetic, begging, weeping, squirming, panicking child, and as Bob winced and cried and screamed, the devil shouted into his ear: \"This is how I will show you that you are in my power! Do you want more scientific evidence to prove it?\" ; \"no more! Please no more!\" However Satan only roared: \"You are not yet properly convinced! You must have more!\" and Bob let out a scream and a moan of tortured humiliation as the devil became unimaginably more vicious, his nails scratching Bob's eyes.\n\nEventually Satan had done, and Bob lay white and shaking on the rock, too wrecked to move or to speak, only whimper like a dog. But it did not end there: Satan now handed him over to some demons and Bob let out a new wail of despair that rang out anew as he was violated again. As they brutally gang-raped him they shouted: \"What's wrong, Bob? It doesn't exist! You're only dreaming! And what a nightmare! Preach your science to us, Bob! Tell us about how clever you are for being an atheist- yes, we all deeply respect how clever you are! And we want to hear what you have to say!\" if Bob whimpered and screamed they would beat him viciously and furiously and demand that he speak, and yet if Bob managed to wail in a shaky, pig-like squeal: \"S-s-science! N-no s-such th-thing as h-hell!\" the demons only became even more angry and offended than ever; and if Bob shouted: \"I confess! You exist!\" it only made them worse: \"The little f@ggot thinks we will stop because he confesses? What, Bob? Do you think we are your slaves, to stop because you tell us to? What an insult! We'll teach you a lesson for treating us like that!\" In his horror, Bob shouted: \"Oh, Jesus!\" ... That was a mistake; the worst thing Bob could have done. No sooner had the name of Christ left his lips than the demons screamed, frothed, gone rabid in absolute fury, and became twice as terrible as they had been before, taking it as a personal insult: so he was raped again for several hours more.\n\nThe torture continued until long after Bob was already utterly traumatised and completely broken, and then at last he was cast into the lake of fire like that rag doll of a raped, bleeding, traumatised, atheist f@ggot-whore that he was, and knew torments there that he had never imagined could exist- not even while he was being raped. Bob shouted: \"This proves God is evil! It's God's fault I didn't believe because HE DIDN'T GIVE ME EVIDENCE!!\" As he shouted these things, he heard someone shouting similar, and recognized the voice of none other than good old Christopher Hitchens! So they both shouted together, but, as you can imagine, neither of them take any comfort in these words. Well, Bob kept shouting \"this proves God is evil!\" and \"this is all God's fault!\" along with his relatives... and when all the other silly atheists come to join him there, they all shout much the same, but no one ever pays them much mind.\n\n...

Overfeeding falls under tort law on the assumption that the parents are not feeding for the purpose of harm.   \nCriminal law is for cases that are clearly harmful anti-societal acts. Murder is a crime because, presumably, if you don't stop it the murderer could keep on murdering, possibly extending to you. You also should note that the concept of child abuse under Common Law is relatively new, and some of it's precepts are ill-defined since parental judgement is seen in most instances to trump state edict.  \nExtending criminal law to encompass additional instances of parental judgement could be expanded to infinitude. Should a state make parents not force their kids to do homework, since that can lead to stress disorders? Should they not be allowed discretion to give them soda, since establishing an early habit of eating sugary foods can lead to diabetes later in life? No.   \nIf you want to go deeper, Common Law, legally, only extends to children because of an argument made in the 1870's that children, being part of the animal kingdom, are entitled to basic protections.

However, this 8 man dept. that covers 6 blocks has enough time to write 90% of the obstructed view tickets in the entire state of Colorado. According to the local news station that did the story, they write over 8k tickets for window tint violations, cracked windshields, and crap hanging from your rear view mirror. The average fee is $90. Now, that's $720,000 in revenue. How are they too busy to even ask my neighbors if they saw anything?

Hell, knowing where everyone was at any moment will solve crimes, amiright?\n\nYou still haven't answered why property crime is laughed at by the police. They couldn't even be bothered to send an officer 3 blocks to take a report. I had to give it over the phone.

I am all for it. \n\nThen again, I am a 30-something white woman who lives in a suburban, affluent town where I regularly see the same police officer in my neighborhood (Bruce - nice guy - lives in the neighborhood). I don't know if I would be as much for it if I were a late teens, early 20s Hispanic or black male who lives in an urban, poor neighborhood. \n\nI think the major problem is that some departments have poisoned the well, so to say.\n\nWe [my town] don't have major problems with police brutality or anything of the like. The biggest issue we have is teenage vandalism and DUIs. The cops don't manhandle you out of your car when you get stopped for speeding or running a stop sign. You don't get slapped with trumped up charges and my police department doesn't have a policy of shoot first, ask questions later. But that's because most of us are affluent enough to be able to afford a good criminal defense lawyer if a police officer decided to act badly. Hell, most of us probably know a criminal defense lawyer because he lives a couple of houses down from us.\n\nI get that if you're in an area with more violence, the police might respond more violently. I am sure police in poor, urban neighborhoods are alert at all times - I saw that myself when I lived in College Park, MD. If you have a general mistrust between the population and the people who police you - or worse yet, if the people who police you aren't from your neighborhood - then I can see the privacy concerns. They are not your neighbors, they are not people you're on first name basis with, they are not people you wave to when you see them driving by.

You're a common carrier if you transport goods (in this case bits) for other people. Railroads are common carriers. Ferries and cabs are common carriers. The phone system is a common carrier. \n\nBeing a common carrier brings with it some obligations, including charging the same price for moving goods unless they require special handling (e.g., explosives) and being open to everyone who wants to use the service (e.g., no \"We don't stop for AfricanAmerican\" policy for taxis). \n\nThe FCC is allowed to regulated common carriers to make sure they live up to their obligations. The reclassification restored Internet access as a type of common carriage, undoing the Bush administration's reclassification out of Title II.

What, if any, action should be taken to ensure this \"net neutrality\" is the main point of contention over broadband, or high-speed Internet access, regulation.\n\nAs the market for broadband continues to evolve, there are those who feel that any consolidation and diversification of broadband providers into content providers has the potential to lead to discriminatory behaviors which conflict with \"net neutrality\" principles. On the other hand, there are still others who think no new regulations are needed, and if enacted could slow deployment of and access to the Internet, as well as limit innovation. They feel that any further regulation would go against the long-time policy to keep Internet as free as possible from any further regulation and I tend to agree with this viewpoint.\n\nThe Internet has been unregulated since its inception and the American people want it to continue to be unregulated. I am hesitant to support anything that could limit competition of any kind and have always felt it is best to have and allow as much of it as possible.\n\nLess competition effectively raises the cost to consumers as has been shown in the cable television industry where very little competition takes place. The practice of continuously raising cable costs to consumers is wrong and is evidence of the need for competition.\n\nAs you may know, in 2005 two major actions dramatically changed the regulatory landscape as it applies to broadband services, further fueling the \"net neutrality\" debate. Both a June 2005 United States Supreme Court decision, National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Association v. Brand X Internet Services, and an August 5, 2005, FCC decision led to the classification of broadband Internet access services as Title I information services. This classification thereby subjects them to a less rigorous regulatory framework than other services classified as telecommunications services. \n\nAlso in 2005, the FCC issued and adopted a policy statement of its own outlining their four principles to \"...encourage broadband deployment and preserve and promote the open and interconnected nature of [the] public Internet...\" These principles are: that consumers are entitled to access the lawful Internet content of their choice, run applications and services of their choice, connect their choice of legal devices that do not harm the network, and competition among network providers, application and service providers, and content providers. FCC Chairman Martin has stated that these principles will be incorporated into any and all policymaking activities of the FCC.\n\nAgain, thank you for contacting me about these issues. If you, your family, or friends need any assistance in the future, please do not hesitate to contact my office.\n\nWith kindest regard, I am    \n\n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n  Yours truly,\n \n  JOHN J.
