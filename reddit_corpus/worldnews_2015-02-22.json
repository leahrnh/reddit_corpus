Now the problem with this is the timing. At the time he was really more of a nobody and had corruption charges against him and Anatoly Sobchak, the guy who was actually running the show at that point. Putin showed that he had loyalty to Sobchak throughout the charges and was then looked at by Yeltsin and promoted to head of Federal Security Services as a stepping stone into power once Yeltsin left. Still, was pretty much an unknown rising to power because of his connections and loyalty. So he runs for president and it looks like he will most likely not win. Then there are a series of bombings of residential apartments in Russia. Putin blames Chechnya and from his post goes about with a plan to strike back and rallies support from the people and eventually gains the popularity to win the now delay elections. Can't have elections while the bombings are happening, so Yeltsin delayed them. Now one other part to mention that draws us back to where we are now with your comment, one bomb didn't go off. After the investigation it was shown this bomb was similar in size and placement to the other bombs. In addition, it was military grade explosives and linked back to the FSS. You know the department that Putin ran? He said it was a training exercise and he was not responsible for the other bombings, but rather Chechnya was even though there was no evidence of this.

Vietnam and Afghanistan are the two big examples - local militias are able to fight endlessly with foreign money and weapons and no ability to go home and live in peace, foreign troops get tired and face growing protest at home.\n\nWhere proxy warfare was effective, it was the result of the aggressor financing a rebel movement or government in the target region and bringing them to power. Examples include Korea and the Libyan-Egyptian civil war, and typically result in two nations, one allied with each side, once both sets of militia believe that they are under attack by foreign aggressors.\n\nRussia's primary geopolitical strategy is to maintain a 'buffer' of friendly countries around them. During WW2 and the Napoleonic Wars, Russia got wrecked by fighting in their own lands. By having allies around them, they can create an excuse to join a war against an aggressor before the fighting is on their doorstep.\n\nRussia's goal is not the annexation of Ukraine nor the return of Yanukovych to Kiev, but the creation of a West Ukraine and an East Ukraine so that the buffer zone can be preserved. That involves having the civil war escalate and continue until both sides are totally incapable of thinking of each other as the same people anymore.\n\nThis terror attack serves that end, increasing alienation between East and West Ukraine.

The several authors of the DSM-IV responded to her, pointed out that they had already addressed her concerns, pointed out that she was taking points of the DSM-IV out of context just to make a false point, and basically made her look like an idiot for using unrealistic, hypothetical examples instead of real science.\n\nHow could such an article have been published?

I work with sustainable transportation and reducing car-dependence but have received money from the car industry for some projects. Why? Because out of 5 funding sources they were the ones that accepted my application. Nothing spurious about that and I don't care where the money comes from. They have actually been some of the best sponsors since they didn't require a lot of additional BS administration and paperwork during the project, whereas you can set aside 10% of a research grant just to deliver progress reports with some public funds.\n\n* In terms of research grants $1.2 million is not a lot of money. The funding alone is not really a problem and can't be used as an argument against the quality of research. I certainly don't deny anthropogenic climate change, but I understand the feeling of having your research interests overlooked again and again by public research grants and needing to seek funding elsewhere.\n\n* There is nothing shady about promising deliverables. Nothing at all. All publications in a research project are called deliverables, no matter the source of funding. It means you have promised to publish your results (to *deliver* a report or article is a target *deliverable*), not that you have promised what those results will be.\n\nNow, that doesn't mean Willie is in the clear, it just means that NY Times are mixing real concerns with nonsense and bringing in the wrong issues for 80% of the article. His research should be evaluated based on the data, methods and explanatory power, all of which are criticised by many experts in the field. The only two things that really matter in this article are that he failed to disclose his funding sources for 8 papers and that the impact of his findings is criticised by his peers.

All models are wrong, it doesn't matter if it's a climate model, an investment model, or a simple pulley and string model. Models take complicated problems and try to simplify them into quantifiable sets to make predictions. Due to the variables ignored, these predictions are never perfectly correct. As far as I understand, the current oversimplification with climate models is due to the lack of processing power. All climate models average large areas together to treat them as homogenous cells. With current petaflop machines these cells need to be very large due to time and budget considerations. I've heard some people say we'll need to get to exaflop before the cell sizes get small enough for their artifacts to be minimal. Another issue is the unknown-unknowns. How much energy is being adsorbed into oceans? How much is in ice-water phase shifts? How much is in increased wind speeds? How much is in nematode migration?\n\nSo, are the models to be ignored because they don't perfectly match measured trends? Should they be ignored because they might not have every variable in them? If all models are wrong why do scientists, financiers, businessmen, mathematicians, artists use them? The answer is simple. Models don't answer questions, they point in the right direction. They minimize risk. For climate we know how CO2, CH4, and water vapor interact with various wavelengths of radiation. We know that the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere and oceans has been rising as a direct result of human activity. We know there is an apparent correlation between CO2 and temperature in paleoclimatic proxies. And the models point in the same direction as reality. \n\nA good parallel is oil exploration. We're drilling holes in the ocean floor deeper than 35,000 feet based on limited data-sets. The information we use has either very poor coverage or very poor resolution. Since we're missing huge amounts of information, our models have huge flaws in them. These holes cost hundreds of millions to over a billion dollars to drill and all too often we don't find what we're looking for. Since our models don't always hit 100% accuracy should we just go home? So should we stop drilling for oil or should we use our models as guides to minimize risk?\n\nYou can pull apart any model to show it has flaws. They are flawed by definition. The question is if they are too flawed to be of use. I'll leave with saying I wish oil exploration models were as accurate as climate models.\n\ntl;dr.

Hurricane and other wind driven extreme events are expected to lessen (and have). A SHITLOAD of land is expected to become airable crop land over the next 80 years as the farm belt moves toward the poles.\n\nThat's making a lot of assumptions. First of all, moving towards the poles means a shift in day/night length, which affects the kinds of crops that can be grown.\n\nSecondly, plants growing faster is a misnomer. Some plants will grow faster. Some will eject a lot more pollen too. So that's a minor discomfort to those with respiratory conditions. More importantly, temperatures become too hot, plants won't have a proper growing season - a lot of them need frost. Related to that, it's more likely that weather conditions will continue to destabilize; winters will become colder, summers hotter, and false-winters (like the one we had here in Seattle this year) will increase.\n\nGreat! You might say... Warm winter weather! Awesome for more growing!\n\nExcept usually those periods are followed by a cold snap, will kill all of the plants which grew too early. (Which affected a bunch of crops this year, increasing food prices).\n\nMix in drought, and you do NOT have a winning situation, no matter how rosily you try to paint it.\n\nThe ethanol mandate was not a good solution to global warming. No-one thought it was, except the corn industry. It was an unsustainable solution from the start - the math didn't work out AT ALL. \n\nBut hey, don't worry - even if we fix our side, China still has to fix theirs.

", "aSentId": 37742, "answer": "I see this a lot with westerners, I really do not mean this in a harsh way, but I find that it's very hard to explain a different culture to come people. \n\nYou are projecting your own morals and cultural norms onto another culture. You can't fathom a culture where their *fundamental* beliefs are so different to your own. Maybe a different example would work. In many parts of the middle east, women are happy when their sons blow themselves up in markets. In their eyes, it is an honor. Other mothers are almost envious, them being the mother of a martyr and all. \n\nThis to you, an American, is inconceivable. A mother who is happy when her own child dies? Even sending her son off to die with a smile. \n\nYet that happens there every day. \n\nNow back to the rape part. Your sister was a victim of a sexist douche who objectifies women. These people exist everywhere. Many people in America might even agree that her clothes were distracting, hell, I can attest that some women's clothes are distracting to the point that it's hard for me not to look at their breasts when they are talking to me. However, if that woman got raped, I would never go as far as to believe that it was because of her clothes. Furthermore, I would never believe that her rapist was justified. \n\nThat's the difference you aren't grasping. According to Islam, a woman is solely responsible because men are wild animals who can't control themselves. They even go as far as to believe that a cartoonist's murder is justifiable because the cartoonist offended someone (those who offended Muhammad got murdered...it's in the doctrine)\n\nThis is a fundamental difference in culture. They never knew true freedom; their words/thoughts are controlled from birth. Therefore, they cannot grasp the concept of personal responsibility so that when they rape it's because the outside world (i.e the woman's clothes) were the cause of them raping. \n\n", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13", "qSentId": 37747, "question": "Only sociaties in decline oppress women.

But you do have to remember that without first hand experience, you're reliant on others to provide you information, and you don't always get to question them or know their agenda or purpose. \n\nSo, is Dubai a perfect society where everyone is wonderfully happy and all races, colours and creeds are treated quite equal diginity? No. Nowhere is like that. Is it a cess pit of betrayal, brutality and a total disregard for humanity? No. Nowhere is like that. \n\nStarting at the beginning - yes, a proportion of foreign labourers in Dubai originally left their homes because of false promises made about the earnings and conditions available. These people are preyed on by the ruthless and it's despicable. Sadly, Dubai (and most of the rest of the middle east) can't do anything about it, because those ruthless 'recruiters' are not Dubai nationals, they're operators from India, Pakistan and other places who work locally. They arrange transport and recruitment and take a cut - but crucially, they train their new earners to say that they're not paying a cut, that they're going to Dubai of their own free will and that nothing illegal is happening. And their recruits do that because they can't earn enough at home, and where they're from not earning means starving. To death. Which is a frighteningly common event. There's literally nothing I wouldn't do to feed my children, so I can understand the mindset. \n\nSo these guys (women are a different case) get to Dubai and go through immigration, which must be done in person, with a rep from the employer. The Dubai police force gives them, in their own language, a list of their rights. An employer is not permitted to withhold wages, or make them live of work in intolerable conditions, or take their passports without permission (some keep them so the guys don't have to find a safe place to hide them). They are told that they must be given access to medical care if it's needed, and that they can leave if they want to (there is some small print here). This is done because Dubai is a brand, and like any brand it suffers for bad press. There's no advantage to treating people too badly - they're cheap enough it's not needed. \n\nThey live in dormitories and are provided food - most work contracts specify a salary and then accommodation, food and services like laundry are effectively free but actually they'd pay higher wages without them. They are bussed from accommodation to work site, and back. They're not allowed to work between 12 and 4 outside during the summer (and when that was new a number of companies got smacked for ignoring it) and they must be provided shelter and water during that time. Most get one or one and a half days off a week, and most find part time work to fill that time. Many will earn as much from their weekends (illegally but very rarely punished) as they do from their week. \n\nAside from a tiny bit of enjoyment money and a mobile phone (most have them and rates to India etc are amazingly low compared to other countries) they tend to send the majority of earnings home. Typically 80-90 percent. If they're indentured to some mob back home, they send the money to them and what's left is passed to the family. As long as everyone gets some cash, nobody complains because then the house of cards falls down. \n\nEmployment law States foreign workers get 30 days leave per year, and a trip home. A lot of manpower companies skimp a little and send the guys home for 60 days every two years (most don't pay the extra airfare, which is shit because it's in the region of $200) but many workers prefer that. They have the option to pay their own flights and do 30 days a year but it's very rare. \n\nEmployment contracts are typically two years, and the majority of workers will renew unless something changes at home. It's a hard existence, but better than what they get at home, so they stay. \n\nOver the years things have improved drastically. The worst of the stories you read are nothing on what used to happen, but a combination of bad press and political muscle from the home countries has improved things a great deal. Dubai in particular recognises that the interest of the brand far outweighs the interest of any individual trying to make a few extra dollars by ignoring the rules. But US corporate standards, punishments are extreme. Where Walmart gets away with paying starvation wages, a company in Dubai caught doing the same would be closed, and the owner effectively banned from doing business. \n\nIt's not perfect. There are cases of violation far more often than there should be, but rates of abuse are falling. Dubai needs cheap labour for sure - it can't survive without it - but it is prepared to pay a bit more in order to prevent people being abused; if only because of the potential damage to the brand. \n\nThere are other issues too - women face a much more dangerous situation, but that too has improved. The UAE runs an egovernment system that means isolation workers from the police and medical services is no longer feasible for the most part. Advances like this are helping to continue to improve things. \n\nDubai is, sadly, better than several other countries - most notably Saudi and Qatar, where abuse is much more common and considerably less socially unacceptable. \n\nI'm no fan of Dubai. I've known it for over 20 years, since it was a little port town, and I have liked it since the Hard Rock Cafe marked the end of town. It's a hard place and business is cutthroat. There are lovely people there (my parents lived there for a decade) and you can find amazing communities, but on the whole I find it pretty soulless. \n\nFor me, there is more work to be done improving the situation of the people who actually make the Middle East run. It's important that that work is done, and quickly because we're talking about people's lives. But the truth is that blindly screaming \"slavery\" dosen't help. The issues have moved beyond that into a much more subtle area, and now a more subtle approach is required.\n\n One big example is working on stopping fraudulent' recruiters' in India, Pakistan, the Philippines and elsewhere. That takes help from the home governments - something that dosen't happen if the perception of the issue is clouded by unfounded but attention (and headline)  grabbing vitriol about stolen wages and hidden passports. \n\nThe situation now requires transparency and openness and when Western media (in particular) goes one about slavery it makes the powers that be in the region shy away from the issue. It also drives distrust of (particularly) America in minds of people, many of whom have never seen this so called slavery and are struggling with huge social, political and religious issues. There's a real social crisis about identity across the Middle East which is hardly surprising given that most of these countries began their modernisation less than 50 years ago. There are people here who remember a childhood of camels and mud huts - their grandchildren drive land cruisers. Add to this the amazingly subtle and subtextual nature of Arab society, and you begin to see the reasons for issues such as radicalisation. \n\nThe issue of foreign labourers is important, and central to any other issues in the region. Please, please, please - if you want to help make things better, learn more and scream less. These are subtle and complex problems and they need solving. If you want to feel righteous, just remember that you're making things worse for real people. \n\n\n-apologies for any typos, I'm on mobile; I'll try to edit later.

Things can change quickly if people try to change them quickly.\n\n&gt; I could talk about the \"slavery\" needed to produce the electronics that they write these things on\n\nYou could talk about that, and argue whether it's the case (I would say no), but how would that be relevant?  Are you saying that nobody is allowed to care about anything because there's always something else they should be caring about instead?  What makes you think these people you're talking to *don't* care about the other thing you're talking about?  That's not an argument, that's a distraction.  This is wholly irrelevant to the conversation of working conditions in Dubai.\n\n&gt; It always seems like they're more intent on shaming than actually trying to fix the problem\n\nWhat would fix the problem then?  If we brush the problem under the rug and don't acknowledge it, or instead talk about other problems instead of this one, is that going to fix anything?\n\nI, personally, am doing my part to fix the problem.  I'm reducing my oil usage by as much as I can, I am divested from any company that has interests in the region, and I *don't* travel to Dubai because I don't want them to have my tourist dollars.  You claim that I need to travel to Dubai to understand the situation, but that would be working against finding a solution, it would be giving money to the very people who are perpetrating the violations I oppose.\n\n&gt;Things are improving at an extreme rate, and most people still think that Dubai standards are equivalent to Qatar or Saudi Arabia.\n\nThis is fair, and yes surely there is some difference between Dubai, Qatar, Bahrain, etc. just as there was some difference between Virginia and South Carolina and Texas.  But what evidence do you have of things getting better?  What actions do you think have led to this improvement?  Do you really think that \"everyone\" talking about \"Dubai slavery\" has had a negative effect on change?  What do you think could be done to bring this change to the other countries listed?\n\nedit: you've been downvoted but it wasn't from me.

The absolute lowest of the workers were tricked into going there, and are forced to live in hostels out of the city. They also have their passports taken away from them so they can't leave. Their families back home think they are doing great and so they are forced to send back whatever they have earned to them.

Concrete and other building materials do as well although concrete has a very low yield and is more apt to snap. The plane impacts punched through the structures all of the way to the elevator shaft which was the primary support area of each building. Imagine cutting halfway through a tower. Now, the floors above are supported on one side and not on another. This causes extreme stress on the connected side. These forces, in combination with the heat lead the steel to begin yielding. As the steel yields, forces continue to increase at certain points up to the moment when they surpass the breaking strength of the beams and supporting concrete. Once it hits this point, the supports of the upper floors break, and the top of the tower begins to free fall. The less damaged floors below, although they can still support themselves, cannot support themselves in addition to the forces from the free falling upper levels... Bam! pancake collapse. There are other factors which also contribute like the bending of the structure caused by the side impact, the location of the hit... etc. In fact, impacts much higher up may have slowed or prevented the collapses but the fact is these planes hit at a level that made it impossible for the bottom levels of the structures to compensate.", "aSentId": 39479, "answer": "&gt; the fact is these planes hit at a level that made it impossible for the bottom levels of the structures to compensate.\n\nThat's certainly long been the most widely accepted hypothesis, but I'm at a loss as to how one could rightly claim it as fact.
