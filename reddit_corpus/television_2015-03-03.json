Things got wacky but the episodes were grounded in reality. As time went on, it started to get more crazytown bananapants. There were \"theme\" episodes that functioned as homages to media. Some times the tropes would be analyzed and played with. There are paintball tournament episodes that touch on themes from scifi and western movies. There is a claymation Christmas episode. There is an episode that plays out like a law and order episode. As the seasons progressed, the stories were still good but the believability of the setting was tossed aside.\n\nDan Harmon, the creator, was fired after season 3. Season 4 felt like a poorly done fanfic of the previous season and it was pretty surprising that it even happened. To make things crazier, they did a fifth season and brought Dan back. He had to deal with character and cast changes that he had no control over. Yahoo decided to do a 6th season is just insane.\n\nI like the places community goes. It isn't \"grounded\" like shows like 30 Rock and Parks and Rec, but I feel that is part of what makes it special. The wacky, madcap adventures turn some people off. It kind of feels more like a  cartoon in some ways. In fact, there was a G.I. Joe fever-dream episode.

That if gas cost less, people would use less?\n\nSecondly, again, I accept that gas taxes are regressive. I understand that, if you are not rich, it makes goods more expensive. I'm in favor of them because it's a much more efficient and well-incentivized allocation of resources. You acknowledge that it's not efficient, and then state that you don't care--you want rich people to pay for your roads.\n\nEven if there were a train going through your town, raising gas taxes on cars would make goods more expensive. This effect would be small, but still present. Across the entire economy, however, it would be cheaper, because a more optimal transportation method would be used.\n\nYou do benefit from people knowing about rhombuses and obscure historical facts. They are more employable, which prevents some crime and increases some consumption. People who are born smart and poor are better able to fulfill their potential. These people are voters, and most people want educated voters.\n\nYour shopping trip is not more cost-effective, it is more progressive. Your shopping trip is more cost-effective if you are poor. We've been over this.\n\nHighways are not particularly fuel-efficient, because per-mile fuel consumption scales with the square of your speed at high speed. A 50mph road with few stop signs is actually much more efficient than a 70mph road with no stop signs.\n\nIt's not at all clear why people who don't drive should pay money so that people who do drive have to sit in traffic jams less frequently. In reality, traffic jams would probably decrease with a higher gas tax, because people would drive less as you subsidize drivers less.\n\nThe extreme version of your argument uses income tax to straight-up subsidize gas, so that it is very cheap. I think we would both agree that a large number of people would drive more if gas is artificially cheap? This would lead to much more congestion.\n\nMaking driving more expensive as a means to decrease congestion is the rationale behind congestion pricing.\n\nAlso note--using income taxes to subsidize highways is also a tax on cities and a subsidy for suburbs, because it makes living in a suburb artificially cheap. If you increase everybody's taxes, and make highway commuting cheaper, living in a city is more expensive, and in a suburb is less expensive.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh6e", "qSentId": 23537, "question": "&gt; In my county, every time someone wants to raise taxes, they use buzz words like education, police, firemen and infrastructure.

No one sees the water treatment facility / pipeline / bridge / road until it is damaged. Therefore, no one cares. \n\n3) Voter apathy. Many of the projects require bond funding. This is most frequently put before the voters. Small turnouts allow a small population to be disproportionally represented. Old people do not like to vote for bond proposals will long lead return items, such as maintenance. \n\n4) Other priorities. Voters do not elect officials on infrastructure. They vote on education, immigration and other hot topics. \n\n5) If it ain't broke, don't fix it. There is a mindset of run till it fails, comparing infrastructure to a car. Replace a part now and then but once it gets too much, just get a new car\n\n6) Social Stigma. This is particular to mass transit. Outside of a few major metro areas, mass transit is seen as for the poor people. \n\n7) Difficulty in observation. The average person can grasp progress on a new road or bridge project.

Allow me to run down a list of other reasons. This is by no means all inclusive. \n1) Politics. Money goes to serve those in power, not necessarily where it is needed.\n\n2) Hidden infrastructure. No one sees the water treatment facility / pipeline / bridge / road until it is damaged. Therefore, no one cares. \n\n3) Voter apathy. Many of the projects require bond funding. This is most frequently put before the voters. Small turnouts allow a small population to be disproportionally represented. Old people do not like to vote for bond proposals will long lead return items, such as maintenance. \n\n4) Other priorities. Voters do not elect officials on infrastructure. They vote on education, immigration and other hot topics. \n\n5) If it ain't broke, don't fix it. There is a mindset of run till it fails, comparing infrastructure to a car. Replace a part now and then but once it gets too much, just get a new car\n\n6) Social Stigma. This is particular to mass transit.

This season, however, I feel like they lost that intrigue, exposing many of its shortcomings in the process.

I can tell you how long you'll have to wait before the answer comes up if that would help you out.\n\nI thought Boone's and Shannon's deaths made a lot of sense (especially Boone's). If you've seen the Season 2 finale, you know why Boone had to die. His death led to the island (and everyone on it) being saved. Shannon's death, while unfortunate, made perfect sense given the way the tail section survivors had been treated by the Others up to that point and driven to paranoia.\n\nAna Lucia was killed of because the actress signed a one-season contract and she didn't want to renew, so she was always planned to be killed off at the end of Season 2. Libby was killed off because Ana Lucia wasn't sympathetic enough to the audience, and because the writers wanted to tell Libby's story through the flashbacks of other characters (note how she showed up in Hurley's flashback and Desmond's flashback); they didn't need to keep her alive to tell the rest of that story.\n\nEko was killed off because the actor asked to be written off the show. He hated Hawaii, and one (both?) of his parents died, so he wanted off the show because of that. The writers intended Eko to have a 4-season arc, but when the actor asked to be let go from the show, they took Eko's storyline and gave it to other characters.\n\nDon't pay too much attention to IMDB. It'll just mislead you or cause you to be spoiled. The show isn't done with those characters yet.\n\nThe flashbacks are important for the development of the characters and the idea that these characters are having to confront their pasts on the island and move forward and correct their mistakes this time around. And once you get into the latter half of Season 3, the flashbacks start to have greater importance regarding the on-island events as well.\n\nLost may not be for you, but it's a great show if you like character-heavy, action-y, psychological mysteries.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh6e", "qSentId": 24479, "question": "Right up front I'll tell you that I love LOST. Watched it all the way through several times. \n\nFirst of all, I'll say that I think it's a little silly to complain about the mysteries before you finish the show. Contrary to what a lot of people say, every mystery is either directly addressed or enough is left in the show for you to head canon it. There are very few things in the show that aren't at least indirectly addressed.\n\nSecondly, the first half of season three is slow because, by that time, the writers knew where they wanted to go but didn't know how long they had to get there. Partly through production, they received a definite end date from the studio. This fixes most of the pacing issues and the second half of season three is much better.\n\nThirdly, the character deaths. Some of them had to leave the show. Others, like the actor who played Eko, asked to be released because he didn't like living in Hawai'i, and his parents had just died. That being said, the reason they build a character up before they kill them is that so you give a shit about their death. Their deaths also serve specific storytelling purposes.\n\nFourth, don't look stuff up on IMDB before you get there. I don't understand this at all. Not only is the information you got wrong, it's disrespectful to both the story and to yourself if you're making an actual attempt to watch it. That doesn't just pertain to LOST, but to any story driven drama. \n\nLastly, if you're skipping over scenes, just stop watching the show. If you don't like it, you don't like it, but nothing frustrates me more than people complaining about a story they haven't actually watched/read. I get that there's some boring flashbacks.
