The only sport I actually actively follow and make a point to sit down and watch is Football (American Football in case that wasn't clear). \n\nI also love Tennis and can definitely sit down and watch a full match, but I don't follow it as closely as Football. I'll keep relatively up to date on Tennis news and watch the occasional major final and enjoy it tremendously.\n\nThat's really all I watch when it comes to mainstream sports.\n\nI also watch professional Disc Golf whenever possible, but that's not even in the same league as Tennis or Football. Good Disc Golf coverage is hard to come by and found primarily on Youtube. I can only watch Disc Golf if it's really well filmed, commentated, and features the best of the best touring pro players competing in a major tournament. So even though I watch about as much as I reasonably can, it's not much.\n\nI realize that Disc Golf isn't remotely as athletic of an activity as Tennis or Football so you might be thinking I'm a hypocrite for calling out Basketball as boring, but then watching Disc Golf. The thing is, Disc Golf isn't interesting because of the athleticism, it's interesting because of the drama and intense pressure of the game from start to finish. It's a whole new kind of interesting. If somebody misses a shot in Basketball it's generally no big deal. Virtually all the scoring for the first 90% of a Basketball game seems inconsequential to me because the games always wind up basically tied near the end. In Disc Golf though, taking a stroke lead on a competitor happens relatively infrequently so any change is exciting. Plus, Disc Golf competitors have relatively few moments where they're actually physically executing a move, and by that I mean throwing the disc. So as a natural consequence, every throw is critically important. There is *always* tension every time somebody steps up to throw unless somebody has just completely run away with an insurmountable lead early in a round. Anyway, I'm just blabbering, we all understand Golf, Disc Golf is just my chosen variety of it.\n\nI also watch eSports, namely Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Quake Live, but again, I only loosely follow the scene and only sit down and watch complete games when there is a major tournament.\n\nSo as it turns out...
