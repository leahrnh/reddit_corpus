It would be like trying to deliver mail without an address or a return address on the package.", "aSentId": 41723, "answer": "Correct.  In the mail analogy it's important to remember each packet is its own letter; it has no knowledge of packets that came before it or the path they took.  Each packet finds its own way through the network to the destination, just like a letter from the same sender may use the same distribution center and mailman but the post office doesn't store the exact route they used to deliver the first letter.  The store the process by which they deliver letters (much smaller) and allow letters to simple work their way through the system.\n\nI think OP is confusing circuit and packet switched networks.  In a circuit switch network establishing a connection actually does involve building a path through the network from one end to the other.  Think about the old images of operators plugging wires in and out to get calls to go through.  Once the call is done the path is disconnected.  With the circuit established all the information you send can only go to the destination (with a downside of only being able to send to a single location at a time).  Circuit switched networks work for streams of data.\n\nPacket switched networks break information into pieces (called packets) that are self contained.  Each packet knows where it came from and where its going.  Along the way a dymanic path through the network is created.  No single hop in the path knows the entire route, it just knows enough to get the packet one step closer to delivery.  Packet switched networks scale up far, far larger with less resources.  The cost of scale is the loss of data streaming.  In a packet switched network packet 100 being delivered is no guarantee packet 101 will make it.\n\nWith the invention of TCP a layer of abstraction was added so a sender could stream data.  The TCP stack turns the stream into packets on the way out and the the receiver TCP stack turns it back into a stream.  The cost of abstraction is always overhead, in this case in the form of 3-way handshakes and sequence numbers.  The overhead of TCP is a small price to pay for all the complication it eliminates or hides.\n\nSometimes it actually does makes sense to skip the overhead of TCP (especially the triple handshake).  Lots of games use UDP instead.  If you miss a couple character move packets it doesn't matter, the next one will arrive and update the game state.  That's why laggy connections have characters seemingly teleporting around the map.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qhmr", "qSentId": 41718, "question": "Can we increase the speed of communication by eliminating information contained in packets?", "aSentId": 41725, "answer": "IP packets are already composed mostly of the actual message (non-header, payload data).

You then have the following cases:\n\n1) if deltaX &lt; 0, then the X increment is negative\n\n2) if deltaX &gt; 0, then the X increment is positive\n\n3) if deltaY &lt; 0, then the Y increment is negative\n\n4) if deltaY &gt; 0, then the Y incrment is positive\n\nNote:  the X increment and Y increment can be 0, and while I never did, you could always special case those (incrX will be 0, or incrY will be 0, but never both unless you're plotting a point; if incrX is 0, you have a vertical line which can be handled quicker than with the full Bresenham algorithm; if incrY is 0, you have a horizontal line, which again, can be handled quicker).\n\nOnce you have incrX and incrY, there are then two general cases to deal with:\n\n1) if |incrX| &gt; |incrY| (if the absolute value of incrX is greater than the absolute value of incrY) you'll end up drawing x pixels over y pixels (horizontal runs)\n\n2) if |incrX| &lt; |incrY| you'll end up drawing y pixels over x pixels (vertical runs).\n\nAnd if you want, you can special case |incrX| == |incrY|, which is a 45 degree angle and can probably be done a bit quicker than the general Bresenham algorithm.\n\nPast that, the details get a bit fuzzy.  But those are the general things I remember.\n", "corpus": "reddit"}]
