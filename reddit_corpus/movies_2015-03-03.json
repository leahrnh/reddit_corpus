The EFF lost its best case last month (Jewel v NSA). No one has changed any laws as a result of Edward. No one has gotten fired because that's how NOT controversial his revelations were (except to some in the internet who's lives' revolve around blanket privacy of their internet activities).\n\nPretty much everyone has agreed that Snowden's revelations about German or Brazilian spying and his revelations about US cyberwarfare with China, has nothing to do with the US constitution.\n\nThat in fact, spying on foreigners is absolutely legal and exactly why the NSA was created in the first place. (I mean what did you think they were doing with radio antennas in pacific islands? That's right, spying on foreigners).\n\nJust about everyone agrees with this, except quite a lot of echo-chamber redditors and other anti-government websites. You do NOT have a right to blanket privacy. The constitution and courts are very clear on this: you have a **reasonable** expectation of privacy, not an **unreasonable** expectation.\n\nNotice how the Edward revelations didn't reveal a single iota of domestic warrantless wiretapping (like in the 1970s scandal)? So what law breaking did Edward reveal? Oh none. What about the moral argument? Who said you are entitled to blanket privacy, what moral book or bizarre logic are you basing this one? Spies will spy. Police will seek subpoenas and warrants (an exception to your rights). Every country spies and they'll continue to do it, regardless of how many directors and conspiracy theorists cash in on this cash cow.", "aSentId": 258, "answer": "&gt; Just about everyone agrees with this, except quite a lot of echo-chamber redditors and other anti-government websites.

It's pretty clear and the courts are clear: domestic emails and domestic phone conversations are wiretapping. Everything else is available for spies to SPY ON, if they have warrants and subpoenas from FISA. \n\nIf they want to spy domestically on emails and phone conversations, then they need a warrant and they can still SPY on Americans when they have that warrant.

They're not taking all your data. They're not tapping your emails or phone conversations.

It's quite well drawn already. \n\nNo one's data has been searched and seized without proper subpoenas and warrants.\n\nNot one revelation showed the agency bypassing the courts to spy on someone.\n\n&gt;The Internet has made it too easy to abuse that authority,\n\nIt really hasn't. The internet has made it harder because there's just so much more information now available. Making it harder to search things that are relevant.\n\nI mean you realize how lucky you are to have a country that isn't warrantlessly wiretapping you daily?

Snowden said that when the latter was arrested, a CIA operative offered to help in exchange for the banker becoming an informant.[75] Ueli Maurer, President of the Swiss Confederation for the year 2013, in June of that year publicly disputed Snowden's claims. \"This would mean that the CIA successfully bribed the Geneva police and judiciary. With all due respect, I just can't imagine it,\" said Maurer. The revelations were said to have come at a sensitive time as the U.S. was pressing the Swiss government to increase banking transparency.[76] In February 2009, Snowden resigned from the CIA.[66]\"\n\ncopy/paste from wikipedia, but as you can figure out it's sourced up the wazoo.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3s", "qSentId": 590, "question": "He joined up after 911 broke his legs but then went into intelligence after.", "aSentId": 595, "answer": "According to military reports he never broke his legs in training, he never made it to training and wouldn't have been able to do what he wanted anyway due to only having a GED.

(And no, it isn't \"our fault.\" While we may have been spying, so is everyone else, and that's just how diplomacy works; you either use the outrage generated by such a revelation to torpedo something you already opposed, are forced to do so by public outcry, or take advantage of the situation to score political points and/or get a better deal for your side.)\n\n\n\nIf I were Snowden, and I had determined this info worth leaking (I'm personally still torn on whether it was), I would have leaked the information about the domestic programs, and only the domestic programs, to various news outlets, and then, once the information had become public, turned myself in on the steps of the US Capital Building. Make a media event of it, invite a few reporters, do everything I can to bring the issue into the public discourse. I would have turned my trial into a public spectacle, and honestly? Had he done that, there's actually a pretty good chance he would have been pardoned, or at least gotten off easily; there would have been too much public attention and support, and unlike Manning no possibility of accusing him of \"aiding the enemy.\" Plus, turning himself in and not fleeing the country would have demonstrated his loyalty to the United States, and shown that he stood firm in his convictions and was guided by his moral compass. \n\n\n\nWhat did Snowden do instead? He leaked information on both foreign and domestic programs, to a foreign newspaper, and fled to China and Russia, two nations with both a deep disregard for the principles he supposedly stood for and with a vested interested in humiliating and opposing the United States. He stole flash drives and hard drives which he filled with classified information, as well as four government laptops he claimed were \"decoys,\" and brought this classified information with him to these countries. Although he claims was never accessed by either, it would be foolish to believe that the Russian and Chinese intelligence services did not gain access to (and they certainly have access to all the information he provided which is now public knowledge) He is currently living in asylum in Russia, supported by the FSB and the Russian government, and allowing himself, willingly or not, to be used as Putin's personal propaganda piece as well as potential bargaining chip. How is that behavior befitting a patriot, someone who loves his country, if not his government? \nEdward Snowden is no hero. He is no patriot, no activist for human rights, no whistleblower. The least of Snowden's crimes is theft. The greatest of his crimes is treason. He is a coward, a hypocrite, and a criminal. \n\n\n\nEdward Snowden is a traitor. \n\n", "aSentId": 1418, "answer": "&gt;  turned myself in on the steps of the US Capital Building\n\nthey would have tortured the fuck out of him\n\nHe is far from a traitor, you then talk about how he ruined the \"american image\"\n\nwe already fucked that up pretty well. i mean we have already killed more then hitler, not sure if it gets much worse then that.\n\nim also 17, so dont expect some big ol' reply from me", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3s", "qSentId": 1419, "question": "&gt;  turned myself in on the steps of the US Capital Building\n\nthey would have tortured the fuck out of him\n\nHe is far from a traitor, you then talk about how he ruined the \"american image\"\n\nwe already fucked that up pretty well. i mean we have already killed more then hitler, not sure if it gets much worse then that.\n\nim also 17, so dont expect some big ol' reply from me", "aSentId": 1420, "answer": "&gt; im also 17\n\nYou are not even legit to drink.

End film with his burial in Gondolin.\n\n* Film starts with the Battle of Unnumbered Tears, but primarily covers the Tale of Beren and Luthien. The BoUT is part of the previous film's chapter, but you CAN NOT end a film on that dark of a note. \n\n* The tale of Turin Turumbur, the fall of Gondolin, and the death of Glaurung, first of the dragons.\n\n* The Fall of Gondolin and the Unions of Elves and Men, ending with Earendil's voyage to Valinor to beg for aid. The War of Wrath would be the film's third act, ending with Morgoth banished to the Void.\n\n\nSo, you get seven good films for sure out of the Quenta Silmarillion, and there's probably enough material around the Akallabeth (the rise and fall of Numenor) for two or three more. The Creation arc that takes place before that is, sadly, too metaphysical to make a FILM out of, and would probably  just be a narrated intro sequence to the first movie. \n\nThe series has a few good recurring themes to it: the distrust between Sindar, Noldor, and Men, and the tensions within the Noldor due to the Sons of Feanor; the constant presence of Morgoth as The Enemy, and the Silmarils as the Major Quest Items. Thankfully, the characters are MOSTLY persistent despite the long timeframe, just because Elves live forever except for when Orcs or Dragons are involved, and the few Men of any significance aren't introduced until very near the end of the timeline.\n\nThe biggest obstacle: there's at most 400 pages of Tolkien's material for all of this. 7 films for the Quenta Silmarillion, 1-3 for the Akallabeth. So whoever writes the scripts/directs the films gets an ABSURD amount of creative license, and what's eventually produced is not going to match anybody's mental image of how these events played out.

After the mind control stopped, and he went right back to normal- he was not intriniscally messed up like Dexter.\n\nThe scene was effective in showing that Valentine's mind control device worked, and that nobody could just overcome it with resolve or self control (as is a cliche in movies). The device hits you and you go crazy, no other option.\n\nGalahad's dying didn't serve to \"put down a rabid dog\", what it did was act as the catalyst for the main character to go into action and put more pressure on him to save things without the backup his mentor.
