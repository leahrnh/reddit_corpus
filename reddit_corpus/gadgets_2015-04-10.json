Because it is open source there are a lot of user made mods out there that can greatly improve your use of the device. Such as widgets, custom home screens and designs and things like that. Also, almost all Android devices have the option for expandable storage with a MicroSD which can be VERY helpful in many situations.\n\nApple has a simpler user Interface, partially because it is more recognizable and doesn't vary with different models. Also, if you have a macbook the continuity feature seems wonderful and very useful in seamless integration into your life, however I have heard from people who also dislike the integration and find it annoying. There are apps for what it doesn't support out of the box, they are not always the best. \n\nBoth great devices, How I overall view it is that if you like tweaking your phone, customizing it, making it your own, and are tech savvy and get that kind of stuff, you will love android, you can also love it out of the box without modding it or anything but you will probably be happier with the iPhone if that is the route you are going to take.\nThis is all my opinion for the most part, but I hope it helps!", "aSentId": 46370, "answer": "The Continuity feature is amazing when it comes to text messages.

", "aSentId": 46529, "answer": "It's funny that you mention efficiency as a plus for iOS. I'm literally pulling my hair out using my iPad.\n\nOn Android, I can click on a something and specify how to open it. A link, a picture, a video, or pretty much any format you can imagine.\n\nI can choose a default app to open it in, or keep the prompt with the option to open it up differently every time. If I make a mistake or chage my mind, I can press the back button and go straight back to where I was, even if I'm in another app.\n\nThe amount of times I've accidentally opened something (or it's opened itself) on the the iPad or an iPhone, and mashed the bottom right corner... Then I realise I need to change apps to go back, it's very unintuitive.\n\nYou can even go back from multiple apps, to the start, by just repressing the back button. It's truly beautiful.\n\nWidgets are also way more efficient than opening up a particular app, especially for something I use often. I have a music player, notes, a flashlight. Very efficient, no nonsense, one single press of a button.\n\nFinding everything I need is a lot easier too. I have 3 screens set up very efficiently. Instead of having random apps everywhere, I keep all my 'less-used' apps stored away in the app drawer, then have folders for games, utilities, etc. on the home screens. It's a lot cleaner than an iDevice, and easy to remember exactly where to go for what (popular apps or widgets).\n\nEven getting files onto your phone from a computer is more efficient, just drag n' drop. No iTunes, no worries. That's if you don't just download it straight to your phone in the first place, for extra-efficiency.\n\nI'm quite certain anyone can do anything on an Android, that can be done on an iDevice, plus much more. This isn't even me being a fanboy, I own both, but I just can't understand why anyone would willingly pick an iDevice over any Android. If you're all synced up with Apple devices, I feel bad for you, but at least I get that.

Depending largely on your phone type (We'll say $200 here as that's what the average iPhone will cost and we'll consider an android phone of the same cost) you won't have to worry about chargers as some have pointed out. Any Micro USB charger will do and there are very few with the USB 3.0 end to worry about (Samsung GS5 and Note III primarily). While you're on the subject of charger freedom, let's talk music. Solid Fact: With an iPhone you must absolutely use iTunes to put music on your phone. With Android phones you can take music from any computer by a simple drag and drop process without having to import it into any such program prior to that. As an added bonus, you can use the stock app that comes with the phone to listen to that music or you can download a different one if you like such as Winamp, Poweramp, etc. \n\nSome Android phones have infrared (IR) blasters that allow you to use your phone as a universal remote. While this may seem like a meaningless feature now, once you start using it, you'll see that it's truly convenient. While some cable companies like Verizon, Comcast and others offer apps that allow you to scan the guide and select a show from there, why have a different app for each of your devices. An App like ZappIR which costs maybe four dollars can give you control over all of your devices and the support is actually really great. Some of those phones have native apps already, which may even save you that four bucks. \n\nWhat I love best about Android phones is that they have been consistently ahead of the curve on every advance that has been made with customization, Near-Field Communication (NFC for payments like Google Wallet or others) and many of the functions that have been shared across the board with other devices. \n\nPeople tend to like iPhone because of it's simplicity. While Android devices can seem a little complicated, just remember they're only as complex as you make them. Just because they have a certain feature, there's nothing written in blood or stone that says you absolutely must use them. Right now there are phones on the prepaid carriers that fall into the $100 range and will still do much of the stuff that I and several others have mentioned. There's still one more thing I'd like to bring up before I close. \n\nExpandable Storage. With some Android phones, you will be stuck with what you get, similar to iPhone, however, there are still a great many devices that allow you to add a microSD card up to 128GB in storage. If you like music, you use your camera, you download little things or you don't want the apps to store to your device giving you a little more flexibility, you're going to want that feature. If you're comfortable with cloud storage it really won't matter, however, paying One Time for a microSD card vs. Paying Monthly for a cloud service that, if you've paid attention to the news or reddit (The Fappening) isn't exactly secure...Personally, I'd still prefer the backup to an external Hard Drive or two and hand one off to family letting them know I hope I never need to ask for it again.\n\nKeep in mind I've used just about every OS thus far from Blackberry, iOS, Android and even Palm OS back about ten years ago and out of all of them, I have stuck with Android phones consistently for the reasons I've jotted down here today. \n\nHope that helps, Have fun with whatever phone you get!", "aSentId": 46705, "answer": "Really good post.

If you don't want a very complicated user interface, I'd actually recommend WP over any other OS. Older users may also like it for the usually high contrast displays and UIs.\n\nThe apps usually integrate very well with the system. Live tiles are super-useful, and can tell you almost everything you need to know without opening the app. 'Deep linking', I believe it's called, allows you to pin certain parts of an app to the home screen, so, for example, I could pin /r/whatever_subreddit to my home screen instead of just the reddit app.\n\nMy phone (Lumia Icon) doesn't have a MicroSD card, which I don't like, however some models do, especially the more camera-oriented phones.\n\nIf you work in a Windows/Live environment, it integrates very well, though I'm mot sure how far MS's Android products have come.\n\nThe lack of real file system integration is the worst thing about the system, IMO. You can't just load files from anywhere on your phone, it's somewhat difficult to share files between programs, however Office works with Adobe Reader well, so I'm not sure if it's just a problem of the app devs not building in the functionality.\n\nSpeaking of app devs, they do exist.

Yes it does not look or feel as nice, but let's be honest, you are going to hide that part behind a case anyways.\n\n* The S5 is waterproof and outperforms almost any other phone on the market even though it's almost a year old.\n\n* Android allows for EXTREME customization. You can relatively easily tailor your phone to work exactly the way you want with only a few hours of research. Having an actual desktop with widgets and customizable hot keys is really nice.\n\n* It has an IR transmitter on the top which has allowed me to change the channel at restaurants or bars to watch whatever I want.\n\n* Though it is still limited in buttons there is a home back and menu button that are useable on every app.\n\n* There is a wide array if customizable keyboards\n\n* Ultra power saving mode allows my phone to last a full week or even 2 months with my zerolemon battery between charges.\n\n* Micro USB is used by everything. You can almost always find a charger.\n\n* You can use other app stores for apps that are not available in the Google Play store.\n\n* A lot more features than you will even need.\n\n##iPhone 5s\n\n* Much easier to use out of the box. The interface is simple and requires no tweaking. It's also almost impossible to screw it up with downloaded apps.\n\n* Default battery life is better than on almost any competitor.\n\n* Because of it's prevalence it is designed for more regularly. There are more cases and accessories etc. Cars and stereos especially tend to support iPhone more than Android. Also there is a better selection of headphones with built in volume control.\n\n* Apps tend to be better written. They appear more polished and run more smoothly.\n\n* Lightening cable is almost as fast as usb 3.0 but is a very well designed port. It is easy to plug in and can go in either way.\n\n* The music player is slightly more dependable. It never skips or lags and is very much part of the core of the phone rather than an enhancement.\n\n* They have great tech support.\n\nNow these are only the phones I know well. There are newer iPhones and many more and newer Androids. Androids allow you to pick a phone for you, where as Apple allows you to pick a phone for everyone.

They sacrifice device functionality and user control for absolute ease of use and device reliability.\n\nAndroid gives the user much more control over their device, and is essentially a miniature computer - allowing you do do with it whatever you please.  Open file system, ability to download files (Torrents, PDFs, you name it), and complete access to the functions of the device.  Virtually whatever your full size computer can do, your Android device can do. \n\n*The downside of Android is that you sacrifice reliability.*  Seldom when I used iOS did anything happen to the phone that was strange, annoying, or \"buggy.\"  The limitations of the Apple ecosystem itself were the most frustrating part.  But other than that, the experience was silky smooth.\n\nWith Android, I have to admit, there are times where the thing just fucking bugs out.  Lock button stops working, the device won't wake up, wallpaper breaks and reverts to default, things freeze, etc.  These things RARELY, if ever, happen with an iPhone.  It started happening with my iPhone 5 every once in a while, but that was after 2 full years of use.  I've had my galaxy for probably a month or two, and these bugs have happened occasionally since owning it (brand new).  \n\n\nApple sacrifices user control, power, and customization for a completely locked down but smooth, reliable, and functional device.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nOverall, the big tradeoff between the two systems can be summarized as choosing between Android's allowance of complete control over a device (including expanded functions, file system access, and customization) and Apple's more restricted but smooth, reliable, and easy-to-use paradigm.  \n\n-----------------------------\n\nBut I mean, Jesus...I have a 64GB SD card in my waterproof phone (sans case), a removable battery (with an extra on hand), complete access to the file system (ability to download files and manipulate them), and much wider access to chargers.  \n\nThe choice seemed pretty obvious to me, but I have to admit there are times when the unreliability of the device has fucked me over.\n", "aSentId": 47334, "answer": "My experience with apple products going back to the original Macintosh is with Apple things are either easy or near impossible.\n\n", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qgzt", "qSentId": 47349, "question": "Note 5.

Like, the guy just gets the facts wrong about both the Retron5 and the SmartBoy.\n\nThe SmartBoy was actually announced a few days before April 1st, and April 1st is the day they announced that it was originally planned as a joke but now wasn\u2019t a joke. Minor inconsistency.\nThe Major inconsistency here is the description of the Retron5, which is just incorrect. The Retron5 does not store the ROM locally on the console: games do not run on the system unless the cartridge is plugged in. It temporarily copies the cartridge to RAM but if the cartridge is removed the game stops being playable.\nWhile this piece suggests there is no advantage to using the Retron5 over original hardware, that\u2019s actually not true. As an all digital solution, the Retron5 gives the TV a clean HDMI signal \u2014 I\u2019ve actually noticed art elements in some games that were unclear on my old TV / original hardware or HDTV using analog video output. It looks better. A recent update also gives it more options: you can now use IPS patches with real cartridges, allowing folks who own a Japanese RPG, for instnace, to apply a translation patch and play that game in english legally. It\u2019s reasonable to assume similar features will come to the SmatBoy \u2014 in addition to a backlight screen (your phone) and other features the original game boy systems were incapable of.\nTHat\u2019s not to argue that Hyperkin is good. They software stealing issue is absolutely real, and the controller that comes with the Retron5 is absolute shit. Like, ABSOLUTE shit, the worst game controller I\u2019ve ever used \u2014 but those statements made it pretty clear that the author has no fucking idea what they\u2019re talking about here. You don\u2019t get to say \u201cI\u2019ve heard of the Retron5 and I know it\u2019s a piece of shit because I\u2019ve never used it and I think it is.\u201d Come on dude.", "aSentId": 48604, "answer": "Or just use a PC.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qgzt", "qSentId": 48605, "question": "Or just use a PC.", "aSentId": 48606, "answer": "I don't know what your comment is supposed to be addressing. \n\nI was writing about the inaccuracies of the article -- it doesn't know what the Retron 5 is or does. I was not arguing the advantages of using it vs a PC. Even if I was, the points I was making clearly didn't sink in with you. Let's pretend I was making that argument for a second and address your counterpoint:\n\nA PC is not a valid option for some users of the Retron 5. \n\nThe reason can be nabbed directly from my original comment: \n&gt;you can now use IPS patches with real cartridges, allowing folks who own a Japanese RPG, for instance, to apply a translation patch and play that game in english legally.\n\nSome folks, myself included, choose not to download and use ROMs, but I do love the advantages of emulators. Once upon a time, there was a company that made USB cartridge adapters for PC, but they were very expensive and are no longer in production. If I want to play a game directly from my old cartridge--with my old save files from when I was a kid--I simply can't do that on the PC. I can do that on the Retron 5. It also allows me to \"legally\" play my old games without downloading a ROM. \n\n\"Just use a PC\" isn't a valid counterargument to the point I wasn't making. \n\nOther reasons to use the Retron 5 over a PC:\nThe PC doesn't support the original console's controllers\nIt's more work to output your PC to TV, start the emulator through Windows and make it a native experience\nYou can't export your old saves from the cartridge to your PC\nYou can't upload new saves from your PC to your cartridge\n\nThere are lots of good reasons to use a PC as well.

It was $150 which was a lot to most people but I didn't care because I knew it would be worth it. It was so much more convenient and useful than I could ever imagine. Everyone I showed it to was blown away and I convinced several of my friends to purchase them for themselves. \n\nThen they announced the Moto 360.

Apple always over charges so that still didn't make me boil. Then they announced that the $350 model was going to be a bright, colorful, and unprofessional looking piece of shit that no business professional could ever wear with dignity. This makes me angry because apple just pushed the envelope of what the customer will put up with and even when they go too far, the industry has a short period of outrage and then it is muffled by the swarms of brand slaves running  to the store to buy it because apple.
