So from a narrative standpoint, I can understand why they omitted him-- making a reference to Mark at that point in the show would have provided nothing, except a nod to the audience that the character existed at one point. And even then, whatever she'd have in her Mark box wouldn't make enough of an impact for the audience to even care.\n\nFrom within the narrative-- I can still buy the idea that Ann didn't have a Mark box. You could easily say that since he moved away from town, Ann had already given him back all of his stuff. Or that their relationship was so shallow that she didn't even have stuff of his to give away. Because the whole idea of the ex-boyfriend boxes was that a lot of it was stuff that Ann bought for herself, because she was taking on the personality traits of the men she was dating.

But when broken apart into individual plots and subplots, the resolutions were downright childish. The whole \"message\" put forth in the Church --- while noble and philosophically defensible --- was an absolute insult to everything that happened on the Island.

This was very exciting for me as a TOS fan, so I started us off. We made our way through at least season 1 before trailing off.

However, I do think she eventually lost interest because of the lack of action (she was always an X-Files/MacGyver kind of gal).\n\nUnfortunately though, there's not a good way to get into TOS from JJ. If you start with the movies, the characters themselves don't have the same meaning as if you had watched at least some of the original series. Star Trek 6 perhaps bridges the gap nicely between modern cinema/good special effects and old school Trek, but really is more effective as a capstone piece.\n\nWhen other friends of mine were inspired to watch Trek after JJ, I held a couple Wrath of Khan parties. First I showed them Space Seed, explaining away the cheesiness and low budgetness, and then we'd watch WoK, the real meat and potatoes. From there, a couple would inevitably express interest in watching more TOS, and when that happened I would carefully choose some select episodes, almost always starting with The Naked Time -- both a personal favorite and a good introduction to the characters and their psyches.

Like pitting Spock and Khan against each other; I thought that was a much better move than having him duke it out with a squishy human captain, and this version of Spock comes closer to making me believe that Vulcans have a wild, savage animal inside of them that needs to be contained than Leonard Nimoy ever did.\n\n\nAnd *that scene.* I think Abrams knew he was never going to match *that scene.* So what does he do? He puts the characters on different sides of the glass, and uses it as a trigger for Spock hulking the fuck out. A lot of people complain that this scene didn't match up with the original for raw emotional power; it never could have.\n\n\nPart of the reason is just the materials available to work with. Actors today (especially the young ones) don't seem as skilled at fine, nuanced, subtle displays of emotion on their faces and in their voices. The older actors are much better at putting desperation in their voices or making you think their voice is on the verge of failing them.\n\n\nLike when McCoy says \"No, you'll flood the whole compartment!\" there's just things going on with his voice there that I don't hear actors pulling off so much today. When Kirk gives the eulogy you can actually believe he's a guy talking at the funeral of a friend and ripped up on the inside. He makes you believe he's actually fighting to keep his composure. Shatner's a ham, granted, but he's a ham that doesn't get enough credit and for all his faults he, like a lot of the rest of the cast, just had skills that newer actors don't seem to possess.\n\n\nThe other reason is the lack of established chemistry. The original Kirk and Spock had years of established chemistry at this point in their story, and not just on screen but through hundreds of hours of working with each other as actors. The new guys don't have that, but I think what Abrams did is use that crowning scene to really start establishing it. Where before it was the pinnacle of their relationship it's being used here as a building block to whatever Abram's future emotional equivalent to that scene might be. Hopefully his actors just become better liars by then.\n\nI've got hopes for the franchise. We're not getting fire yet, but there's friction and smoke. \n\nAnyway, don't limit yourself to the movies. There's a lot of good television in each of the series, including Enterprise. I'd catch the top 10 or 15 episodes of the original, and then kind of flip and browse through TNG, VOY, and DS9 however you like.\n\nAs far as Enterprise goes, it has its faults. Some things in it that are considered faults aren't actually faults at all but put there on purpose and unappreciated for what they are except by those familiar with storytelling. Other things are just faults. It's got a different sort of storytelling though and has a lot of large story arcs, so the series can't be consumed in just any old order like the others can for the most part.

TNG is probably the best of all the shows but if it had done some things just a little more like Enterprise it would have only made it better. You'll see. There's a lot of stories in TNG like 'Best of Both World's' and 'Time's Arrow' that would have been exponentially more awesome than they already were if they'd have been broken up into 3-5 episodes or more instead of 2. There's even more that were only one episode where they should have been two.
