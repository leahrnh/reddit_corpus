More broadly speaking, this story draws on human nature when it comes to how we seek justice, and it questions whether it's fair to be judged by your peers. He plays with your expectations by stacking the deck in favor of Trusdale, by making seem likable - jokes on the stand, family ties (mentions of his father and brother), gracefulness in his punishment, until the reality of his death becomes apparent and he then shits himself scared like an innocent man might do - .... when we believe he's innocent, the injustice seems palpable. Everyone seems so unfair. And then king flips it around on you at the end... he actually was guilty. \n\nSome writers would stop here and let you draw your own conclusions. King adds on the last section to spell it out for you. Human beings can be unfair, regardless of actual innocence or guilt. They can witch hunt, they can murder little girls without conscience, and they can sympathize with the man who murders little girls. None of it really seems to make sense, yet all of us can relate to it. ", "aSentId": 7281, "answer": "I upvoted you.

Maybe they were just both greedy bastards.

Why now? Why kill (and possibly rape) a little girl, now? We dont get to see that far into his head. Since there is such a fuss over the coin, since the coin is silver, since the coin gets a back story and it sounds like such an attractive thing (and since the girl gets no such treatment), I still think that his motivation is having the new coin. He sees the girl, sees the coin, and loses his mind. Maybe he tries to take it, she resists, he kills her. The rape accusation might just be part of the witch hunt. People say he's dumb, but they don't treat him like he is out of control of his own actions. And besides, if this story is about a man who's too stupid to understand what he's doing, then the story as a piece of work is pretty pathetic. What could King possibly be getting at if the main character just doesn't know what he's doing?\n\nThe new money is silver. I imagine he sees it as maybe his only chance to get a taste of his dream, which is to own a bunch of silver. That seems like the most plausible answer to me. He doesn't spend the new money on drinks, so that lends credibility to the idea that the money is more important than alcohol. I think Trousdale purchasing alcohol is just a way for King to show us that he knows the value of his money, and to show us that he's poor.\n\nSo yeah (i'm responding to each of your paragraphs 1 by 1), trousdale's motivation very may well could have been sex. But with a 10 year old girl? So he's not only a deviant but also a pedophile. It's fucked up, but it's possible. HOwever, I dont see any other part of the story pointing in that direction.

He always wears his hat, wouldn't he notice the hat missing right away and assume it would connect him to the crime? If he simply left it at the bar, it's believable that he didn't think it urgent to retrieve the hat that evening. And if someone was meaning to frame someone, the local drunk with possible psychological problems and an identifiable clothing item would make for a great target.\n\n3 the coroner was so angry at Trusdale in court that he got himself kicked out of the room. He was trying so hard to convince himself and the court that Trusdale is guilty his emotions got out of hand. (I believe the coroner killed the girl and at this moment he is projecting his own self hatred onto Trusdale. That's why he declines the offer to go help build the gallows, it would be too much for him to be where he knows he actually belongs)\n\n4 during the recess while the jury decided their vote, the coroner found out that the sherif is doubting Trusdales guilt. The coroner fears the sherif will further investigate and so he concocted the plan to plant a dollar into Trusdales remains. ( or he planned this all along, but this is why he told the sherif first, he wanted to silence his doubt as soon as possible)\n\n5 when Trusdale was crying over his food \"going to the grave with him\" I think he meant just that. If he was crying over the coin still in his stomach, wouldn't he have got food he knows would make him sick and try and force the coin out? I think he got his favorite food, and it was so good he lapped it up and then was grief stricken because it was probably the best meal he had eaten in a long time and it didn't even get to fulfill its main purpose to nourish him.\n\n6 the coroners motive is consistent throughout. There hadn't been a hanging in ten years which means there hadn't been a murder in ten years. The police were using his hurst which means that his business was dwindling so much that he had to sell it or rent it to the police station. By killing the girl and sentencing someone to death he gets two pay days. And they never found the coin in Trusdales living possession because when the coroner killed the girl, he stole her dollar. And at the end of the story, the coroner suggests not giving the coin as proof to the family. That is because he can't afford to lose his hard earned dollar. And why was he so calm when he told the sherif about finding the coin? Why wasn't he excited and angry like he was in the courtroom? Was it because he was putting on a show for the attendees during the trial? He didn't want to be too over eager to share the evindence because he knew someone might suspect him of planting it.\n\nEdit: after another read through I noticed more pointing to coroner Hines. He not only planted the dollar but also the poop. How could the meal Trusdale just ate turn to poop when already? It was still in his stomach wasn't it? Or else he would have tried to push it out when the sherif got him a beer. And if he really did soft through his bathroom bucket everyday to re-swallow the coin, wouldn't they have noticed his bucket to be tampered with and his hands smelling like fesses? King never mentioned this because he never sifted through his own waste bucket. And lastly, when Hines asked the sherif if he thinks Trusdale is innocent, the sherif responds that if he is, the killer is still walking around, hence Hines.\n\nTLDR The coroner is a greedy man desensitized of the idea of death and he was willing to kill for that next pay day.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh4i", "qSentId": 7402, "question": "&gt; Some comments are implying that the undertaker or sheriff were part of a conspiracy, but the length and tone of the story seems very \"on the surface\".
