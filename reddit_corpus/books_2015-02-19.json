Our columnist, Hephzibah Anderson has tried to solve them with bibliotherapy. Here are her first responses.\n\nDear Textual Healing,\n\nI would be very interested in your recommendations for any books to help me through a difficult time of my life. At 57, I am feeling a bit lost. I have a wonderful, loving spouse and bright, caring teenage daughter but I am lonely and have lost my spark for life.\n\nI have always taken care of everyone and managed a career, but, after the death of my father this summer, my difficulties as a child in a terribly dysfunctional family have come back to haunt me.  I have become unfocused and often reclusive while my husband is away frequently on business and my daughter busy with school and friends.\n\nI am seeking the help of a therapist and taking care of myself but I would love to read something to help me \"get my groove back\" and reengage with life. Better put \u2013 a kick in the arse!\n\nDear PC,\n\nFrom the glimpse you\u2019ve given us of your life, it\u2019s no wonder you\u2019re feeling a little lost. But before prescribing titles to help you get your groove back, I\u2019d recommend filling a thermos with strong sweet tea and taking a journey into Rebecca Solnit\u2019s sublime non-fiction book, A Field Guide to Getting Lost, which is packed with the wisdom of everyone from Pat Barker to Thoreau and Keats.\n\nThe word lost is rooted in the Old Norse \u2018los\u2019, meaning the disbanding of an army. \u201cThis origin suggests soldiers falling out of formation to go home, a truce with the wide world. I worry now that many people never disband their armies, never go beyond what they know,\u201d Solnit writes. So instead of fearing that lost feeling, try seeing its potential for discovery. Explorers, remember, are always lost simply because they\u2019re forever someplace new\n\n\u201cLeave the door open for the unknown, the door into the dark,\u201d Solnit advises. \u201cThat\u2019s where the most important things come from, where you yourself came from, and where you will go.\u201d Easy enough to write, you may say, but Solnit didn\u2019t have the easiest childhood herself, growing up \u201ca battered little kid\u201d in a violent home.\n\nFor something that asks a little less of the reader while still giving plenty in return, try a dose of Anne Tyler, the beloved creator of numerous protagonists whose plights will strike a chord with anyone who finds themselves at a midlife impasse. One such character is 53-year-old Rebecca Davitch, the heroine of Back When We Were Grownups. Like you, she\u2019s juggled marriage and motherhood with a career but suddenly finds herself feeling lonely in her own home. Could it be, she wonders, that she\u2019s \u201cturned into the wrong person\u201d? Don\u2019t be fooled by the way this novel ambles along \u2013 as Rebecca revisits youthful ambitions and the college boyfriend she jilted, it asks some heart-rending questions before arriving at a place of graceful, joyous acceptance.\n\nAlong similar lines, I\u2019m also going to recommend The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry by Rachel Joyce, which will double as a tonic for those reclusive tendencies you mention. Its eponymous protagonist is 65 when he learns that a former colleague is sick. On his way to post her an insipid note, he decides instead to visit her \u2013 on foot, from his home in deepest Devon to England\u2019s northernmost town, more than 600 miles away. You don\u2019t manage that without focus! It\u2019s a pilgrimage that will take him 87 days to complete, during which he considers his childhood, marriage and relationship with his son, and becomes an accidental media sensation. By the time he reaches his destination, you\u2019ll feel anything but weary.\n\nFinally, Ruth Ozeki\u2019s mesmerising novel A Tale for the Time Being is probably too subtle to deliver that proverbial kick you\u2019re after, but there\u2019s a strong chance it will charm the missing spark back into your life. Fusing the diary of a doleful Tokyo teenager with the story of the middle-aged novelist who finds it, washed ashore on a remote island off the coast of British Columbia, it\u2019s a beautiful illustration of how our lives touch \u2013 and are touched by \u2013 others in ways we mightn\u2019t even be aware of. This Man Booker Prize finalist has plenty to teach about Zen Buddhism, bullying and quantum mechanics, and unless you happen to live in one of its settings, it provides a bracing change of scene, too.\n\nOne other suggestion: books, as we all know, make great companions but that doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t be enjoyed in the company of others. If you find yourself home alone, why not slip one into your back pack and head out to a favourite caf\u00e9.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh4i", "qSentId": 704, "question": "Outside the Neighborhood: Reading Italy Through Elena Ferrante", "aSentId": 705, "answer": "Wonderful review essay.
