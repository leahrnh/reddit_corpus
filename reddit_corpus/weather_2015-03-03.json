If a front develops in a modeled flow, it will precipitate. Precipitation isn't unpredictable; it's a direct consequence of the fluid dynamics controlling the atmosphere. The problem is the flow itself is difficult to predict two weeks in advance for many reasons, and since an accurate precipitation forecast is fundamentally conditioned on an accurate flow forecast, it's going to be unreliable.

For example, where I live, in summer, we get a lot of rain that randomly pops up. Might rain here today, or the next town over tomorrow - based on the energy in the air, winds, if rain has recently taken energy from the air.....

Now when the ball is a foot away from the pins it's pretty easy to predict this. If you are familiar with the game you could probably give 90-95% accuracy at that point. When the ball is further back in the lane the accuracy goes down, because you are relying on your past experience to see clues it gets a bit hazzy, but at the beginning of the throw you might still be able  to get a good 60% accuracy.\n\n So in forecasting you are at the pins. So next day forecasts will usually have a high accuracy. While the beginning of the throw is more like 5-6 days out. So if you wanted to predict the weather, or the out come of a throw, longer out you need to look for patterns in how variables are linked to results. In bowling these variables would be foot placement, wind-up, release, ect. In weather this is pressure, heating, precipitation, ect.\n\n Now this isn't super accurate if you look at it blindly. But we have been analyzing patterns for decades now, and with the aid of supercomputers we can take these small clues and produce very educated guesses as to what might happen. These guesses are called Numerical Weather Predictions, and are illustrated as forecast models. Now there are dozens of different models that each give a differnt outcome due to computation differences. And none of them are that accurate over a week. But multiple models will usually agree on a certain event and that's enough to say there's a chance of rain, or snow far down the road.
