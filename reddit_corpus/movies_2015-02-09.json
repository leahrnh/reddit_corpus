The low-key pace which - in my opinion - helps makes it so good is probably too low-key for many viewers.\n\nThere have been commercials for it on TV, but it seems like they try to frame it too much as a crime film, when really it's about something else (a commentary on early 80s US capitalism, and the parallels/blurring of lines between gangsterism and \"legitimate business\").\n\nThe film was set in 1981 for a reason: around that time a certain section of the population was inspired by the election of Reagan to acquire wealth at any cost, often without even really knowing why (remember the question that Brooks' character asked the main character, which went unanswered?). It was a strange period that had a definite transitional feel to it, with a lot of hope mixed with anxiety and fear over the big changes that were obviously about to happen. Crime went up to an all-time high in 1981 (hence the film's title). The movie did a good job of touching on a lot of that stuff.","aSentId": 132,"answer": "No big names? Excuse me what?

The original 3 films in the Star Wars saga, were they \"just movies\"?  Was there something inherently different about them?  Perhaps the time in which they were first released?  Maybe in and of themselves they were just movies, but taken into the context of the film industry in which they were released under in the 70s and 80s, then they have some extra meaning or significance.  Which makes me wonder, can you **ever** have \"Star Wars\" again?  Can there ever, in the history of film, be another saga that had the impact and importance that the original had?  I dunno if any Star Wars Films can ever be anything more than \"just a movie\" ever again.  I mean even in the original saga, by the third movie it was already waning a bit.  The impact of the third film kind of lost it's bravado in the middle of the film.  \n\nNow that Star Wars is firmly in place in the collective conscious, we can never again be inundated, surprised, mesmerized, and entranced by the uncovering mythos of the world of Star Wars.  We all already know it.  So any new Star Wars flick will just be that, just another Star Wars.

What bugs me is when people claim practical is better because the actors are actually reacting to something \"real\" on camera. I don't buy it though.

Sure things that are fantastical are harder for your brain to accept and you're much more likely to notice CGI than say in these scenes in the OP, but that's not really what people mean when they talk about CGI being obviously fake. Of course a lot of these things in movies aren't *real*, but it's an aesthetic thing. It's about having all the visual properties of *looking* like a real object, and no matter how you look at it there is a lot of CGI, usually in older or low-budget movies, that visually stands out from the shot as clearly added in.

I suppose that since I've grown up loving the film, I've known the backstory so well and for so long that I thought it was a bit of common knowledge, at least around here.  The OP mentioned a documentary about Jaws; there's one called The Shark Is Still Working, which I would definitely recommend.  The shark suffered many technical difficulties while shooting, which caused Spielberg to have to completely change many of the shots, scenes, and the overall tone of the film.  Since they had no CGI to work with, they relied on the extremely unreliable animatronic shark for many of the important shots.  Spielberg said he originally intended to create more of a \"creature feature\" with a B-movie feel.  In the novel, the shark shows up right away by hurtling out of the water when attacking Chrissy.  This was meant to be shot similarly in Jaws, but the problematic shark did not allow it.  As a result, we have the much more frightening and iconic opening scene in which Chrissy is taking deep into a watery abyss with the monster unseen.  Additionally, the use of the dock or barrels to show the shark's presence instead of the shark itself were improvised decisions on set to go ahead with scenes without the use of the shark itself, as filming was very troubled and far behind.  All of those scenes were conceived to show the shark, but they were not able.  This also allowed John Williams' famous score to serve a greater and more suspenseful purpose.  The fact that they filmed on the open sea gave the crew fits but really added to the overall feel and atmosphere of the film.  I think it really creates a better element of realism to the film than green screens, if not just for the fact that the actual environment stirred up a true tension between people on the set, particularly between Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss, which gave even more depth to their relationship in the movie.  Spielberg also hired Ron and Valerie Taylor to capture real footage of great whites in Australia where CGI effects may have otherwise been used.  As a result, the Taylors captured a shot of a great white caught and thrashing in a miniature shark cage.  Spielberg loved the shot, but there was a problem.  Nobody was in the cage at the time.  Hooper was scripted to be eaten from the cage in line with his original fate in the novel, but the shot was deemed to be so good that Spielberg changed the arc of Hooper's character.  As a result, Hooper escapes the cage and survives the film.  So much changed on set due to the restrictions the cast and crew faced, and a young and unproven Spielberg was able to harness his genius to create a historic accomplishment.  It's quite fascinating.

Not for the direct telling of the story, but for the indirect believability of that story.\n\nThere's a similar case in music in regards to tuning. You don't necessarily notice tuning; a lot of people don't even really know what it is, or the intricacies involved with it. Sure, the orchestra tunes their A. But A is only A; there are 11 other notes, and many other octaves, plus A is only A when compared to A. An A in an F chord is different than an A in an A or a D chord.\n\nSo if everyone in the orchestra is playing a perfect F chord, but one violist doesn't play their A a little flatter, you won't notice it. You won't even necessarily say, \"I didn't really like that performance of the Mozart piece.\" But something, very small, unnoticeable really, will have been wrong, and that insignificant little wrongness can make you say, \"That was brilliant\" or \"Meh, that was pretty good.\"\n\nSo, all those little details do make a difference to your perception of it, just not a noticeable one. You won't know why you didn't like a scene, or what in the movie didn't *quite* gel for you. Something will be there, and it will be the happy little spaceman walking through the background of the 1920s Australian Outback.","aSentId": 3139,"answer": "This all assumes that someone is engaging in criticism that is rooted in such transient, subjective feelings, rather than at least making an attempt at engaging with the work as a communicative object and judging it on its own terms.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3s","qSentId": 3140,"question": "This all assumes that someone is engaging in criticism that is rooted in such transient, subjective feelings, rather than at least making an attempt at engaging with the work as a communicative object and judging it on its own terms.","aSentId": 3141,"answer": "An orchestra that is slightly flat on some notes is objectively worse than an orchestra that is perfectly on pitch.

Some of the computer editing done in the GIF in question is just to swap out minor things in the background - one kind of house instead of another, a few more people here or there, etc. These kinds of things matter in terms of continuity or meeting the neuroses of a director to have things a personal way, but they're minutia compared to the bigger thing they exist to help facilitate - the narrative.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm glad that directors have the ability to exercise more control over their work. At the same time, limitations help force creativity and innovation, so it's important that there be a balance, especially as we hurtle further and further into the future and see the cost and accessibility of this technology decrease and broaden, respectively.

The point isn't that you can \"grab anyone off the street\" it's that the nature of competition between the two roles is very different. Firstly, most qualities you need to be a good VFX artist/animator are obtained through hard work and endless practice, and as such are \"available\" to a larger population. Whereas the qualities you need to be Leonardo DiCaprio are only found in a population of one. That isn't to say being a good actor is easy - it sure isn't - but there are loads of actors likely more talented than DiCaprio/other a-list celebrities but we've never heard of them. Simply, to be a good actor (and recognized as such, a la Pitt, Clooney, Streep, etc) isn't only down to individual skill and talent, whereas with VFX/CGI this is more or less true.\n\nAs well, sometimes directors don't require \"the best\" CGI but rather \"good enough\" and at that level the difference from one animator A who is very skilled, to animator B who is less skilled, is marginal. In other words, production studios can very easily substitute one animator for another as there is very little difference at the highest level. This creates a market where it becomes a competition of who can offer \"good enough\" quality for the lowest price.\n\nI'm not defending the way VFX artists and animators are treated by the industry, just explaining why it is.\n\n(And my initial disagreement was with your quip about DreamWorks, a production company that makes their own movies, is very different from the prior point about DiCaprio and VFX artists.)","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3s","qSentId": 3516,"question": "Then perhaps you could explain why?

We don't have Sundance overflowing with new talent and festivals filled with tons of new indie films. \n\nWhat we have, are 'indie' films produced by Hollywood names for millions, being labeled as indie, and a bunch of people using digital distribution and making no money off their films. \n\nWe have festivals like Sundance, which has become amazingly corporate, flooded with films with stars and names attached, essentially boxing out the smaller indie filmmakers.\n\nI'm not interested in getting into some kind of petty argument with you either, so let's not get snooty. VERY FEW filmmakers are doing what Kevin Smith or Rodriguez did, and those guys wouldn't have a chance with Clerks or El Mariachi in today's climate. Amazing true indie films are being overlooked because no one wants to distribute them, because everything is about an opening weekend these days, and very, very few true indie films get theatrical runs of any substance. \n\nIt's technically easier to SHOOT the movie, but harder than ever to get it to anyone that matters. It used to be impressive that you went out and made a film for little money, now everyone is skeptical as hell -- it's almost like distributors are conditioned to assume that if you made a film for 20k it probably sucks and isn't worth their time, the same way nobody wants to read your script, nobody wants to watch your movie or distribute it if it's not based on a book or doesn't have Elijah Wood in it.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3s","qSentId": 4137,"question": "That's just lazy...

He existed beyond Arda, in a sense, and thus he can manipulate creation in a way the Children cannot. He creates these Rings as a way of extending his will over the Children. The elves utilize his techniques to tap into the power and create three Rings that primarily preserve, or, more correctly, impose an unnatural state of changlessness or immutability on the world. The world was made to adapt and change, or evolve, so the elves have perverted the natural order. Since the Rings all draw on the same wellspring of unnatural (in this sense meaning \"from beyond the confines of the material world\") power, when the One Ring is destroyed, and Sauron is destroyed with it, the batteries powering all these unnatural manipulations are destroyed, so the effects gradually fade, restoring the world to its natural state. The elves are therefore left as unchanging beings in an ever-changing world, which is unsustainable, so they leave Middle-earth and journey to Valinor, which is a different region of Arda that has been removed from Middle-earth by the power of creation itself.","aSentId": 4620,"answer": "Interesting write up, thank you.\n","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh3s","qSentId": 4622,"question": "Is all of this from Tolkien's books, or is much of it elaborated and assumed/ from fans over time?

Beware)**\n\nI mostly agree with this review (although I liked the film) but there's a few explanations present within the film that I think YMS missed.\n\n- the death of lizard dude came from the device that Caine uses opening walls and floors that we constantly see him use (and which was used to enter the harvesting chamber right below their fight and still in use while they were duking it out). Caine shoved Lizard Dude into the hole and quickly closed it to strangle him.\n\n- The oxygen suits that Caine puts on in Jupiter the planet before giving on to... Er, Jupiter the person was not for while they were on... *sigh* Jupiter the planet but due to the fact that Caine expected the two of them to at least be forced to go into space by entering the closing portal themselves which is what happens. (This does not change the fact that the film is excessively inconsistent on how oxygen is affected in space. Like WTF).\n\n- This is just speculation but I'm sure Caine and Stinger's wings are less \"Oh I need these\" and more a sign of reinstatement into the Aegis. \n\n- Bees recognizing royalty is a reference to their hive mind arrangement, not as random as expected.\n\n- That \"I love dogs\" scene? I didn't recognize it as serious. I recognized it as deliberately awkward. That Caine left immediately afterward because Jupiter made it awkward, when Jupiter rolled her eyes I didn't read that as orgasm, I read that as \"ugh, I'm a fucking idiot.\" But these are terrible performances we're talking about.\n\n- Caine also resembles a wolf in more than his ears. His jaw is more extended in a canine manner, a bit of prosthetics work that looks so fucking uncomfortable that I hope to attribute Tatum's boring sleepy performance (I usually love the dude) to it. Also most of the cast resembles animals in more ways than just their ears, we got elephant face guy, we got Balem's right hand guy looking like a rodent, we got fucking lizard dude, fer chrissakes. (Side Note: Part of why I am sure YMS just wasn't paying attention to the film is because when he comes to this point, he claims the information of Caine's genetic origins comes at the middle of the movie when Caine and Jupiter are saying \"blahblahIlovedogs\". We are told of Caine's origins waaaaaayyyyyy before that with Jupiter on Stinger's farm with a lengthy and absolutely exhaustive monologue Sean Bean gives about Caine and Stinger's previous life. Like it was its own scene by itself. This is just the first time Jupiter bothers to bring it up because she is too wary to mention Caine murdering a Royal earlier on. The fact YMS thinks that THIS is where we, the audience, learn said information implies that YMS was not paying attention.)\n\n- The never-less-than-presentable toilet scrubber Jupiter saying she hates her life is in reference to the later fact that we discover her previous form, the Queen, herself was in the best position possible and still hated her life enough to arrange her own murder.\n\n- The whole Brazil bureaucracy scene wasn't for a joke about the DMV, but because much of the film's plot centers on legalities and claims for Jupiter to make and loopholes of the law. Hell, that's precisely the only thing that keeps the Abrasax siblings from doing anything rash.\n\n- Speaking of rash, the important thing to recall is that this sibling rivalry and family business. The siblings are essentially children who play at being adults as best as they can but they slip, hence why Balem's would start acting like a selfish indulgent little shit when he doesn't get his way. That said, Redmayne still overdid it. A lot. He could have toned it down and not really get caught acting. And Kalique didn't really do much beyond give some more exposition. Ugh, exposition. And I can understand if the relationship between the siblings is missed since they only have one scene together and only two scenes in which one of then talks with Jupiter about the others. They didn't really allow the relationship to be integrated into the tale or affect the plot so much as just being character background with graceless underdevelopment.\n\n- If you saw the film, you know damn well why the telescope matters to Jupiter, they don't need to explain it verbally.\n\n- I also don't think Jupiter cared much for ruling the world in the end, especially after learning the circumstances of the Queen's death.

Hell, that's precisely the only thing that keeps the Abrasax siblings from doing anything rash.\n\n- Speaking of rash, the important thing to recall is that this sibling rivalry and family business. The siblings are essentially children who play at being adults as best as they can but they slip, hence why Balem's would start acting like a selfish indulgent little shit when he doesn't get his way. That said, Redmayne still overdid it. A lot. He could have toned it down and not really get caught acting. And Kalique didn't really do much beyond give some more exposition. Ugh, exposition. And I can understand if the relationship between the siblings is missed since they only have one scene together and only two scenes in which one of then talks with Jupiter about the others. They didn't really allow the relationship to be integrated into the tale or affect the plot so much as just being character background with graceless underdevelopment.\n\n- If you saw the film, you know damn well why the telescope matters to Jupiter, they don't need to explain it verbally.\n\n- I also don't think Jupiter cared much for ruling the world in the end, especially after learning the circumstances of the Queen's death.

People will remember the tale of Luke Skywalker and his quest to defeat the Empire, but not John Carter to um.....i forget.\n\nAnd even if you want to make a complex sci-fi like 2001 or Solaris, you still need to minimalize the complexities and present as much \"show &amp; tell\" as you could.

Oops, that's the asteroid that ghosts can't touch and everyone knows he's evil because he extorted the planet. \n\nThe other plans aren't working, so Danny gathers all the ghosts of the ghost zone, first by kidnapping them, but then they break free and ultimately choose to help him when he explains, because it's not like he hasn't saved the ghost zone before, and quite a few of them respect him, (even if they hate him). \n\nSo together they use a machine Jack Fenton builds to ghost the entire earth instead of the asteroid of death.

What was amazing was the fact that, despite it being live action, it was absolutely faithful to the original strip. There were some necessary changes, like the fact that it had to have a proper running story, and as a result the movie kind of plays out like Home Alone (John Hughes wrote the screenplay, and a new drifter/criminal character played by Christopher Lloyd makes an appearance for the purpose of Dennis fucking him up just like Kevin fucked up Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci). Despite this, the visual aesthetic was bang on, and that's all that mattered. It really was a Dennis The Menace story come to life. Especially when the casting director actually seemed to give a shit about who played who (something that's increasingly rare these days). Look at a picture of Lea Thompson as Dennis' mom and Dennis' mom in the comic strip, bang on. Look at Walter Matthau as Mr. Wilson in the movie compared to the comic strip. Bang on (well, kind of, Mr. Wilson in the comic strip is morbidly obese, Walter Matthau was actually pretty fit). Hell, the actor playing Dennis' dad so so much like his cartoon counterpart it's fucking eerie, and he's literally in the movie for only a few scenes.\n\nSo, what's the point?\n\nAs of recently, this kind of thing has been sliding, especially in kid's movies based on other properties (you'll notice I'll be getting heavily into comic strip-based movies). In the Garfield movies, the only thing they got right was Garfield himself (thank you, Bill Murray). I dare you to compare a picture of Jon Arbuckle from the strip with a picture of Breckin Meyer as John Arbuckle in the movie. And please don't tell me that Liz in the strip looks even close to Jennifer Love Hewitt in the movie. Or how about Marmaduke, which doesn't even seem to be based on the comic at all (Marmaduke doesn't talk in the comic, and he never has).\n\nHowever, we did recently see the trailers for the new Peanuts movie, and not only looks amazing, it even seems to adhere to what made the comic special in the first place. This gives me hope. If Peanuts does well, and Spongebob currently doing well, we could see some *good* movies based on licenses.\n\nUnfortunately, there seems to be a deficit of people who actually give a shit and actually want to put the love into these movies that they actually deserve.","aSentId": 10411,"answer": "Who's Breckin Meyers?

But it cost 2.5 times as much to make.  That means on each dollar spent, the studio is making 70% as much as it did for the first Spongebob movie.  Since that time movie tickets have gone up in price by 33%.  If you adjust for that, this movie is making 53% as much per dollar spent.  Even worse, this new movie should expect a larger portion of the audience will see it in the opening weekend, because (as OP points out) it's an older audience.  Finally, arguably the merchandising bump the studio will get from the movie is much worse because it's an older show and an older audience.\n\nSo by every measure, this movie is not doing as well as the first Spongebob movie.  While that did okay, they didn't give it a sequel for over a decade.
