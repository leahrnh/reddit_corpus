It felt weak, for all the reasons already stated here, but mostly for feeling like a filler.\n\nTo me, the show also felt like it lost its bearing, and quite predictably after Frank's ascent to presidency, there was little left for him to achieve in quite the same way as in the previous seasons. However, when it turned out that the re-election would be a main theme I had some hope that the show would return to its true form... but I felt it didn't.\n\nAt times, it seemed the show bordered on becoming an Opposite Day West Wing, with certain problems (Jordan Valley, anyone?) taking center stage. But the previous seasons were at their best when all the policy and government problems were only touched upon as elements of Franks machinations to obtain more power. They hardly mattered, especially to Frank. Whatever the writer's intentions were (maybe to show that the responsibility of the office finally got under Frank's skin), I don't think it's working, from a dramaturgy perspective. Besides, all those storylines that they used for their forays into geopolitical drama had little to add to the ones they seemed to be carbon-copying from The West Wing.\n\nHouse of Cards was always at its best when it showed Underwood scheming to get ahead and bring down adversaries with the same criminal energy as him, using policy and the workings of D.C. as tools to achieving their own goals. This season, all the adversaries, even the ones that were taken over from previous seasons, felt outwitted by Frank even when they were scoring points against him. Dunbar was hardly good for surprises and the congresswoman constantly made a fool of herself. Not even halfway through the season, the congressional leadership falls completely by the wayside, somehow, just as Mendoza. The only true adversary, Put-- Petrov, is too far removed from the rest of the story to actually matter in the same way as Frank's Season 1 and 2 adversaries. We are not getting in his head and the potential for far-reaching, complex and interconnected machinations was small.\n\nOn the other hand, some other brilliant opportunities to play to the show's strengths were not taken. Who else would have liked to see how Underwood schemed his way around the fallout of announcing he changed his mind and would run again? Instead, it's all buried between two episodes and only touched upon in the debate.\n\nHad a hard time with suspension of disbelief as well. I don't see the White House Chief of Staff taking off for a multi-day psychokiller vacation in the midsts of a re-election bid by his boss who's out campaigning.

Sure, it's fun to see Frank beaten at his own game by a player who is even more ruthless than he is, but the pleasure of the show has been in watching Frank scheme; we didn't get to see Putin's (I mean, Petrov's) thought process at all. I think it's great to add a new wrinkle by having someone pull one over on Frank like that, but they should do that *in addition* to showing us Frank's usual schemes, not instead of.\n\n2\\. Frank was clearly a bad man, but he wasn't dastardly. The series clearly knew this and took painful steps to try to fix it without interfering with the plot in any way. Look, he's pissing on his father's grave! Look, he's spitting at Jesus! Uggh. Good characterization is showing how ruthless a character is; these little moments set apart from the actual plot just feel like the writers throwing a bone to those who expect Frank to do outrageous things. Throughout this season Frank is unpleasant company...but does he ever really screw anyone over? Remy and Jackie didn't leave because they were betrayed, they left because Frank was mean.

He had quite a bit of leverage over the Underwoods which he turned into...a job...and not even a high ranking job, at that. I got the impression that he was playing his own game for his own purposes. In Season 3, he was basically a prop; he was only there because the plot required Frank to have minions. Remy and Jackie fare a little better, but that's coasting off of their story from Season 2.

Really, it's all the magic of people's love for Claire? There's plenty of opportunity to show Frank trying to undermine Dunbar (much like he did in the all-too-brief debate). That would be fun!

It was somewhat of a social commentary of the standard that we hold our president to and the ridiculous things people choose to judge him on. Frank's most challenging opponent thus far is trying to twist and turn and please the media and people, which he is struggling with because a)being a president is hard as shit and requires more than bullying votes and b) there is not one clear person that will make this problem go away by pushing them in front of train or ruining them politically. He's only facing people in his own party at this point and barely winning. How do you think its gonna be when Repubs choose their nominee?\n\n2. Claire. We've always known she is smart and ruthless, but shes never challenged Frank so much. She is starting to realize she might never gain the power in her own name and that is killing her. Frank can't just take her down because deep down he knows he NEEDS her, which is what makes her leaving at the end such a disastrous prospect.

So perhaps 'whoever did this' (heh) at the end of the ep was able to get to her to get the information.\n\nRegarding her name and AJs SUV: Her last name is \"Flammer\".  Her and AJ are sitting in his SUV in the woods (parked on dry leaves) when the SUV catches fire.  SUV on fire---&amp;---her name \"Flammer\".\n\nAlso, while in the SUV they are listening to Bob Dylan's \"It's Alright, Ma\" which contains the lyrics:\n\n&gt; \"he not busy being born is busy dying,\"\n\nWhich can fit in with the overarching theme of whether Tony can change who he is, etc.\n\n----\n\nHowever, none of this is really confirmed by the show.  So *maybe* Rhiannon knowing where they are going to dinner that night matters or *maybe* the SUV burning is a clue or *maybe* the Dylan lyrics means something here...but maybe not.\n\n\nWhat I love about the Sopranos is that it left a lot of stuff ambiguous on purpose.  So while one could think these were largely impactful moments, they could also just be David Chase creating more complexities for the hell of it.

Maybe. \n\nYou have to understand, the three camera format, with its characteristic joke-beat-laugh-joke pacing, derives from older forms of comedy such as vaudeville. They were all live performances, naturally, and the beat was to allow audiences time to react without 'stepping' on the next line. But writers soon took advantage of the pacing, playing with line lengths and redirects and so forth, allowing the cadence of the lines themselves to help build the reaction. Which is why listening to comedy with laugh tracks sounds weird with the laugh track scrubbed out, and why reading scripts of some very funny shows isn't nearly as funny, because the cadence of the lines is itself part of the humor. That's why, for example, Shakespeare sounds better read aloud than written- the cadence and pacing is at least as important to the scene as the content of the lines themselves. \n\nShit, I can't believe I just compared 70s television sitcoms to Shakespeare and didn't get struck by lightening. Maybe the gods of comedy think Norman Lear us a Shakespeare pseudonym. \n\nAnyway, my point is, shitty three camera sitcoms aren't shitty *because* they use a laugh track, and portable single camera dramedies aren't funny *because* they omit the laugh track. It's possible to suck or be great in any format. But trying to force an art form into a format in which it doesn't fit never works. You can play with convention, work within convention, work against convention, or transcend convention, but you can never, ever try to use the convention of one form while working in another form, because it never works. \n\nFor an illustration of the point I'm trying to make, carefully watch the Scrubs episode My Life in Four Cameras, season 4, episode 17.

I'm not saying that the minds behind it aren't clever, but anyone can catch the jokes in the show as long as you follow current events.\n\nMy point is not that the men and women behind American comedy are any less brilliant than those in the British sphere, but rather that American comedy is tailored to be a little more low-brow and British comedy keeps you on your toes in figuring out the punchline. You have to remember little details from earlier in the show/season or know a little more than average about a certain subject in order to catch the full depth of the joke when it comes to British humor. \n\nA lot of American humor is based on shock value, and that type of humor can be easily worn-out. Maybe it's just a difference in taste, but I like for there to be a little work involved in being able to fully appreciate a joke. It makes the joke feel somewhat rewarding for really getting it, rather than just laughing because the punchline was a bit more inappropriate than I anticipated. \n\nEdit: I also just want to clarify that I don't dislike South Park simply on the basis of shallow humor; I just find the comedy too goofy/outrageous.

The parents almost never clued in on how evil the sister was if they ever did and Drake and Josh always got the short end of the stick when dealing with her, even when she had no justification to be mean to them (but just liked kicking them). They really overdid it on her character (Even Stevens did the trope a lot better with Shia's character honestly. He was a lot more balanced between obnoxious little sibling that makes older sibling's life miserable but also showing that he actually cared even if he was obnoxious). I honestly think the fact she was a female factored into this and some PCNess about wanting to show females could be dastardly too (and I say this as some one who calls herself a feminist). \n\nReally, I think my biggest complaint is the sister and parents and a lot of stuff revolving around her.\n\nBut my second biggest complaint is a lot of time Drake's coolness (and sometimes downright being a jerk) was shown to be something that really worked for him and Josh's dorkiness shown as him being a kicking stone.

We have the studious older sister who is serious and of course the younger male sibling who is obnoxious. The only original thing is the sister wasn't so worried about shoes and what she looked like. I will say thinking about it, that was refreshing). Kinda like \"Good Luck Charlie\" except I think GLC is a lot more charming than Even Stevens (though the brother in GLC got a lot less amusing when he was no longer so little... it's like they lost the inspiration for that character).\n\nNed's had a lot more zany/amusing characters and went more on randomness type humor which appeals to me a lot more honestly (Though I do like cheesy family sitcoms too).\n\nAnd, while Even Stevens wasn't a bad show (I just wouldn't put it as original or great, just entertaining), I can't forgive it for introducing Shia to the acting world. That's the only show I didn't want to bitchslap his character in (his character kinda fit for what they wanted, an obnoxious little brother). Every other thing he's been in that personality just comes off as an insufferable brat. And he can't do anything different. It really makes it seem like he's really just playing himself cause he has no range at all (I think even Brad Pitt might have more range... and Brad Pitt also is only good if you are going to typecast him cause he has little range.
