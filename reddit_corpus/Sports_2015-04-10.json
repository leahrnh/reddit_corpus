My guess is Canada has a large native American population, much like Alaska does. So i am not surprised they share a similar sentiment. \n\nI have lived in Alaska for almost 30 years. I started working in an office downtown in an Alaskan city 2 years ago. In that two years, I have been threatened 5 times (stabbed, beat up, general shit talking). Guess what kind of person it was each time? An intoxicated Alaskan native.\n\nJust last month I had a guy come into my department, stumble up to my desk and ask me for smokes and a few bucks. When i told him i had neither, they guy starts digging around in his pockets saying hes going to \"cut my face off\". The guy was fucking hammered.\n\nAt least 2 - 3 times while walking to my car from the office at night I've had a group of drunk guys talking shit. And its always intoxicated Alaskan natives. There is actually a rule for the company stating women should not walk to their car alone when its dark out because of constant harassment from intoxicated natives.\n\nAnd to save the best for last. Its the middle of January 2013, probably 8:15 AM. Cold as shit and dark out. A guy comes into the building, drunk as shit, walks into my department up to my desk. He reaches in his backpack and pulls out a massive tube of raw fucking hamburger and drops it on my desk. Says he will sell it to me for 5$. When I tell him I'm not interested and he needs to leave - guess what - death threats. \n\nSo down vote me all you want, doesnt change the fact that Alaska has a MAJOR problem with alcoholism in the native community.
