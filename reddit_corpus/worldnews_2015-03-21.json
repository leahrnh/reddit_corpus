Why should you bisect a city with another highway, when for the same amount of money you can make the existing highways less shitty to commute on by removing the people who don't really want to drive?

And if you can get away with charging $20-$30 per spot per day, like Chicago and DC do, park and ride can partially pay for the transit system itself, assuming you don't build cheap crappy parking garages that need to be rebuilt every 15 years.\n\nI don't see why London can't do something similar.

Even if it costs 10x more for the material, surely it's cheaper to do it right once than having to buy materials and hire crews to do it every few years?", "aSentId": 29545, "answer": "There are a couple factors at play here, but first and foremost a road is primarily the underlying groundworks and not the top coat of asphalt or concrete. It sounds like the groundworks for your road have degraded to a point that it needs to be replaced and until then any surface coat will fall apart pretty quickly. Additionally asphalt can be almost entirely recycled and reused whereas concrete is basically just ground up into aggregate for asphalt or concrete (but the cement has to be new since it's a chemical reaction).      \n          \nConcrete is also more difficult to repair and when replacing you have to go through with a jackhammer to remove it. With asphalt you can use the giant grinder things that cut layers off the top into waiting trucks to immediately remove from the site.       \n        \nAsphalt has the advantage that over the years new layers of asphalt can be added thereby thickening the roadway making smaller roads capable of carrying heavier loads. Concrete takes days to cure before use and typically gets retopped with asphalt when it starts to fall apart.        \n        \nSo while concrete is more durable and can take heavier loads, asphalt is the more practical option anywhere that the road is used. Concrete works well on roads/lanes that you don't need to use for months at a time but once built you can't touch it for years.

The amount of work that goes into an interstate is vastly different from a residential road. For one interstates are subjected to completely different load requirements. For another they typically take a very long time to build, and when they do need to be replaced they tend to take even longer. So you don't save on labor, and you probably don't save on materials either. \n\nLet's for example say interstates last for around 20 years or so, and an asphalt road lasts about 5. If the cost of doing it in asphalt is 1/10th that of doing it interstate quality, that means you can get about 50 years of asphalt roads for the cost of 20 years of interstate construction. If the asphalt lasts even longer, then the savings actually end up being pretty big. The big factors are how long the road lasts, and the costs.

The problem with that is that it will inevitably mean Israel loses some land and some of their people will then live in Palestine (and I guarantee you, they will then be subject to the same human rights abuses that Palestinians are now under). Short of this, the land given to the Palestinian people under any settlement would almost certainly be insufficient for their own leaders to accept the deal and still maintain control over fringe groups like Hamas. The second Palestine gets their land and they feel it was not \"enough,\" Hamas will split back off and declare that they will never give up the fight because they are once again the victim. \n\nAnyways, the point is that its way more gray than most people will admit. Its not that easy to generalize about such a complicated issue. It's just way easier for people to do that than accept that there may not be an easy solution and its not good vs evil.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13", "qSentId": 33423, "question": "President Obama: ''We take Netanyahu at his word when he said a Palestinian state wouldn't happen during his tenure''", "aSentId": 33456, "answer": "Netanyahu spit in Obama's face and treated him like a fucking field hand instead of the two term President of the United States.

That still leaves much room for negotiation. But provided that the Palestinian request at the UN, still unfiled as The Economist went to press, does not undermine the basic terms of this deal, it is hard to see why any peacemaker, including America's Barack Obama, should oppose a proposal that nudges Palestine closer to real statehood (see article).\n\nIn this section\nHunting the rich\nCatching up is so very hard to do\nYes to Palestinian statehood\nThe uses of hypocrisy\nDim sum for China\nReprints\nThe practical and procedural politics of the UN is trickier, but unless the last-minute negotiations deliver something dramatic, the arguments in favour of at least securing the Vatican option surely outweigh stasis.

Since his grudging acceptance two years ago of the two-state principle, Israel's prime minister has shown no eagerness or flexibility in his purported pursuit of a deal. Settlement-building on the West Bank, which he has refused to stop (barring a partial nine-month freeze), is no mere side issue; the Palestinians accurately liken it to the spectacle of two people negotiating over how to share a pizza while one of them continues to eat it. (Unlike the UN status, this does change things on the ground.) In his speech to Congress in May Mr Netanyahu refused to accept that Jerusalem, whose eastern Arab-populated part the Palestinians see as their capital, should be shared.

Also violence in the community is very prevalent as many families use violence to conclude quarrels and disagreements -- which only leads to more violence within the near future. The smallbone report was leaked last year outlining child abuse within the community.\nAlcohol plays a huge factor within the demise of the community. It's currently a 'dry community' meaning no alcohol is allowed otherwise you'll be charged, but some locals manage to smuggle alcohol in from a nearby town and sell small bottles of spirits for roughly $250 each. This leaves no money for some parents to buy food for their children and on occasion i've seen their children eating semi-rotten coconuts off the ground. This factor also contributes to the daily attempted break and enters into government worker residences and contractor accommodation to find food (as they usually touch nothing else in the property except for the fridge) and maybe cause a little damage too.

Is it actively keeping these cultures alive, or is it just making indigenous social problems more remote?\n\nI think it depends on who you ask. I live in Canada and we have our share of Aboriginal issues as well. A lot of the reservations we have here are just a fucking mess. Like you say, substance abuse and child abuse, and poverty too. Lots of bad things, that's for sure. Some the reserves here are so far in the middle of nowhere that you have absolutely no chance if you live there. There are no jobs, no way to make money, everything is ridiculously expensive because it all has to be flown in... It's just crazy.\n\nPersonally, I think the Aboriginal people hang onto it with everything they have. They want to \"keep their culture alive\" or whatever you want to call it... But at the same time, I think that by doing that they're actually slowly killing themselves. They're hanging onto something that just doesn't work. And if they were to just say, okay fuck it, let's start over and try something new, things would be okay.\n\nAs an example, Attawapiskat.  It's a reserve in Ontario, waaaay up there. And to be blunt, it's a complete shithole, there's almost nothing good about that place. They declare a \"state of emergency\" all the time, for one reason or another... I remember not to long ago, the government said, \"Hey, let's move you guys closer to a nearby city, one that you can actually drive to!\" and it would have been great. It would have given them a chance to have everything for SO much cheaper, so many more jobs would have been available. It would have been a whole new fresh start!.... And they said no. Don't want to lose their culture! But it's like, shit, your culture is killing you! You can't survive and grow and prosper there! But nope, they don't want it, the white man fucked them over once before and they won't let it happen again...\n\nSo it's just a sad situation all around, one that doesn't really have an easy answer, other than just keep throwing money at it (which obviously isn't working, but what can you do, eh?)", "aSentId": 33910, "answer": "It's kind of hard to live off the land when the land the white man has given you is typically shit.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13", "qSentId": 33911, "question": "It's kind of hard to live off the land when the land the white man has given you is typically shit.", "aSentId": 33912, "answer": "Depends on the tribe.

At settlement there were over 500 distinct Aboriginal nations each with their own language,  law and culture (down to around 200 now). Each also had their own territory, on which their religions were commonly based. Someone who comes from a tribe on the east coast has zero connection to the land on the west coast for example. \n\nFor Aboriginal people the land they want access to is very specific, and as a result many nations had all of their land taken, while those out in the desert managed to more successfully maintain their ties to their land, largely because it wasn't immediately useful to colonists so they didn't move people off of it. They now have to continuously hold their land with their presence on it to claim the land under native title. If they move off of it they legally lose access to land their people have been living on for 50 000 years permanently (as in their descendants also lose the right to claim). Added to which they have a history of being absolutely dicked by the European Australian government, so they justifiably have exactly zero trust of them and anything they say at this point. \n\nForcing them to move is a huge deal, and the reality is they will most likely choose not to  even if all services and assistance are taken away, because for the people there their land is everything to them. Then it becomes an issue of how ok as a supposed first world nation we are with letting the original inhabitants effectively be third world citizens when we could easily not do that. ATSI people already have life expectancies 20 years lower than the rest of Australia, low literacy rates, poor education rates, suffer from easily preventable diseases that are more typical of developing countries and so on (old laws allowed doctors to force them from their homes and treat them without their consent for instance, which now makes them reluctant to go anywhere near doctors or government institutions like hospitals, so they tend to self medicate, which now leads to these kind of issues). Name a measure and they're dead last by a long way already, and they got there via policies that our own government has described as genocidal (see the Bringing Them Home Report).

In 2009, he was the subject of a civil court case in the United States.[31] Another photo shows an American soldier apparently raping a female prisoner.[31] Other photos show interrogators sexually assaulting prisoners with objects including a truncheon, wire and a phosphorescent tube, and a female prisoner having her clothing forcibly removed to expose her breasts.[31] Taguba supported United States President Barack Obama's decision not to release the photos, stating, \"These pictures show torture, abuse, rape and every indecency.\"[31] Obama, who initially agreed to release the photographs, later changed his mind, as he believed their release would put troops in danger and \"inflame anti-American public opinion\".[31]\n\nIn other instances of sexual abuse, soldiers were found to have raped female inmates, and senior U.S. officials admitted that rape had taken place at Abu Ghraib.[33][34] Some of the women who had been raped became pregnant, and in some cases, were later killed by their family members in what were thought to be instances of honor killing.[35] In addition,**children were raped in front of their mothers.**[36]\"\n\nThe thing is - Obama is right. After seeing little kids and women from your country raped and sodomised by enemy forces *anyone* is more likely to go out and fight those enemies. I am utterly disgusted with these acts but I would much rather see these crimes tried and punished in civilian courts than have these images released for many many reasons. Unlike in Vietnam the sort of sexual abuse which happened in Abu Ghraib has not been epidemic in Iraq and thus soldiers targeted as a result will likely to completely innocent. It seems like the US forces have made big progress in cracking down on this sort of thing (remember haditha? those guys had to sneak off base wearing black clothes and hockey masks). This stuff happens in war, but much much less now than it has in historic american wars. \n\nAnother issue is how these pictures will be used - any images showing a woman being raped or forcibly stripped are going to be misappropriated to be used as a form of pornography in some sections of the internet - particularly due to their high profile. The sad reality is that thousands of people will be masturbating to images of these people being raped - has anyone even asked the victims if they want pictures of them being forced to bare their breasts and look into the camera while they sob plastered over the new york times? Does that even enter the equation? Does a black bar over her eyes and nipples really make that ok?\n\nSurely its enough that the stories be told and the crimes be punished (which needs to fucking happen), why do we actually need to see the look on the teenage boys face as he is sodomized, what does that actually achieve?", "aSentId": 34875, "answer": "In front of their mothers?
