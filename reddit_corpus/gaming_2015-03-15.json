Are your zones in the best areas? Are your people educated enough? Why is there traffic at the city entrance? etc", "aSentId": 24704, "answer": "Yea, the traffic is the biggest thing.  It isn't a \"game\" in the sense of missions or a story, but it's like Sim City used to be (I'm not sure the new one). Basically, just build a city and keep expanding it to make it how you like.  \n\nThe tax and funds system are a little too easy, so once you get past the initial stage of the town then you'll have a vast amount of constant stream of funding.  Government services (police, fire, medical) are easy as well to keep your residents covered and well supported.  Water/irrigation is fairly easy in a city with a river, as is sewage.  Power is a little difficult up front as your funds are still limited and you'll run into a fair amount of brownouts.  But essentially, the whole financial system with the taxes and how you get a fairly strong constant income after a few hours, then it's really easy to add more power plants and services as needed.\n\nTraffic and transportation is the \"hard\" part.  You want your streets to run smoothly, but if you didn't plan up front then you have tons of renovations in store to reroute traffic.  Highways are your friend for industrial zones.  You'll want to really not connect industrial too much to commercial/residential.  Just connect it to the highway and the railway with easy access to a cargo port.  That'll ease up a fair amount of traffic.  But then your industrial zone would be heavy on traffic.\n\nIn general, intersections are bottlenecks for traffic.  So you'll want to reduce intersections and add overpasses.  A solid public transit system eases up on your residential/commercial zones.  But then those back up, so you'll need to beef up public transit.  \n\nSo you just keep adding and fixing your roads, highways, and public transit.  It's a never ending struggle.  After the initial difficulty, the game turns more into a simulator and fairly realistic traffic planner system. Really, traffic is a major part of city planning, so it's good that they have this down.\n\nWhat they need to add though is a much less forgiving economy.  I haven't figured it out yet, but taxing should be able to be different on districts.  Having unrest from shortfalls would be good.  Having people move out when taxes suck would be good.  All I see is just demand for more zoning.\n\n**tl;dr**: Game is way too easy after you get large enough and the city turns on autopilot eventually.  Having a road system with a minimal traffic is the hard part.  It would be nice if they added more difficulties to managing an economy. Despite the simplicity, it is ridonculously addictive.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh03", "qSentId": 24701, "question": "From my understanding with this game, a lot of the difficulty comes in figuring out how to make the city run as efficiently as possible in terms of traffic and what not. Of course the game is fairly easy overall, as you can just follow the little menu at the bottom that tells you the current demand for residential/commercial/industrial zones, but the difficulty is in maximizing efficiency.

The realities of its' game play or lack of game play make that difficult.\n\nSome people and groups are decent. That's true in games and the rest of life. What's also true is that people tend to act much worse when they have some anonymity. This is true in all social settings. EVE seems to encourage it though, and that's a problem. I know from my own experience that I met some good people, but overall, what I encountered was a game that acted like a reservation for those unfit for other communities.\n\nI have read about the amount of harassment that went on elsewhere in the game in the distant and not so distant past. There was apparently an attempt to make an all-female chat channel since they were having so many problems in the game. I doubt that kind of channel would be successful in any game tbh. Talk about a troll-magnet. There have apparently been long standing issues with various prejudices that frequently showed up in chat channels. \n\nEVE is sort of unforgiving, but many games carry that title these days. Dark Souls is just one example that comes to mind. I felt that EVE players tend to use that as an excuse for their actions. There's no real basis of truth to it other than you lose real money when you play.\n\nI think the \"hate\" part has actually been recognized by CCP and in some part the CSM since they know they have a population problem. However, it became pretty obvious that they have no idea how to get out of it. The current NPE changes seem to reflect that. Since so few actual new players come to EVE, they don't seem to have an understanding of what new players actually need. The bulk of new players I ran into were just alt characters of established players. Actual new players tend to leave too quickly and don't have enough information to provide good feedback. \n\nI don't know what EVE can do to fix its' lack of ability to interact with the rest of the gaming world. It seems to be enough of an issue that devs and players are actually treating it as a problem. I doubt that they will gain much ground in that though. The community is a far too insular to be more than a niche game. \n\nLet's a face it, even Transformice has more actual logged in players than EVE does since EVE has so many alts. Even not counting alts, the numbers run pretty close. That shouldn't be the case since EVE has a lot to offer even with its' issues. The players on the other hand are a problem compounded by mechanics that enable and condone a poor experience.\n\nLike many people, I also really tried to like EVE but couldn't. The game wasn't difficult (which is a good thing) but between the boredom and players attitudes, it wasn't worth my money.\n\nEdit: I want to add that I don't think it's bad to be a niche game. I like niche games. EVE needs more people playing it though. When you look at the log in numbers and you realize that a lot of people are running 2,3 5, 10 or even 14 accounts, then there's a problem. That means very few *people* are actually playing. If a person quits, they take a bunch of accounts with them and since so few people come in to replace the ones that leave it becomes a serious issue.
