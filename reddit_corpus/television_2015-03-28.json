My favorite was, because the secrets to powers were stored in a persons brain and Sylar seemingly reconfigured his own to be able to utilize his victims powers, all of those various powers adding up eventually caused a tumor to form in his brain that no amount of healing or shape-shifting would fix. The tumor would grow over time on its own, and faster if he gained more powers. With the growth of the tumor, the strength of his already acquired powers would grow as well, but if he leaves it there for too long he would eventually die. He could cut the tumor out, potentially, but along with it goes all of the powers.\n\nSo with this, you have a Sylar who has had his entire career of murder catch up with him. His quest for longevity to gain more power ironically leads to him being forced to confront his mortality; he can have a ridiculous amount of power, but he'll never be able to keep it. This leads to either a nerf in his power, his death, a more organic transgression into being good beyond silly mental gymnastics, or a combination of some of these.\n\nBut no, he was the ultimate baddy from season 1 that partially made the show so successful, and they had to treat him like the golden child.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh6e", "qSentId": 28661, "question": "Ohh god, I like the guy, but his character totally FUBARed the original show.

Not even in the flashbacks where she argues with Lin does she act particularly insecure. Her logic is less \"you can't abandon them\" and more \"you have power why don't you use it\". Kuvira never acts obviously insecure until the finale. \n&gt; The only leap the viewer would have to make was that the person who was extremely obsessed with security was trying to compensate for her own personal insecurities.\n\n You call her obsessed, but obsession has negative connotations implying excess or irrationality. Every action she takes until the end is logical and usually successful move towards building her personal power. If there had been a scene showing her acting against her strategic interest in order to compensate for her personal insecurities I would buy it, but she never takes a specific action due to insecurity. \n\nYou could argue her general plan, build a powerful nation under my  personal control, is a product of personal insecurities, but that is really general. There are plenty of other equally valid motivations Kuvira, or anyone really, could have for wanting to build a powerful empire. We have just as much evidence that the Fire-Lord was acting out of personal insecurity in expanding his empire as Kuvira was.\n\nBesides Kuvira takes actions that are clearly motivated by things other than personal insecurity. She builds race-based prison camps and attacks Republic City even though it does not directly threaten her rulership. These actions are more easily attributable to racism and ultra-nationalism, and revanchism then personal insecurity and are characteristic of fascist ideology. While personal insecurity can play a part in making fascism attractive to say fascism is purely a product of personal insecurity is reductive and really problematic. \n\nThis is what I mean when I say LoK wants to do adult themes but thenr esolve them in childish ways. It draws on fascist/ultra-nationalist ideology and imagery to create a character like Kuvira, but then instead of address that it rights Kuvira off as someone who simply went to far trying to overcompensate for a bad childhood. As if Fascism is the natural consequence of trying to find personal/national security and involves no other really problematic assumptions about the world.

Then in Korra alone Toph gives her a speech and Jinorra shows up and she's pretty mcuh fine emotionally. \n\nShe has those weird flashbacks facing Kuvira but this is not linked to any other emotional issues which effect her and are fixed by a Zaheer monologue shortly thereafter.  \n\nKorra's recovery is poorly done character growth because although her character changes, it does so largely for arbitrary reasons dictated by the plot and not as a natural consequence of who she is and what she experiences. \n\nWhy was Korra depressed/traumatized in the first place? Why does she hold on to her pain like Zaheer says? How is the audience shown that? What changes about Korra that allows her to overcome her depression? Why is she finally able to accept the pain? \n\nThere aren't good answers for all but the first of these questions.  I can imagine possible answers, but they aren't shown to the audience. \n\nI'd argue that Korra never actually grew. She wanted to be the avatar since she was a little girl. In S1 she lost her ability to be the avatar, she gests depressed, runs away from Mako and contemplated suicide. Then Aang restored her powers. \n\nIn S4 she loses her ability to be the avatar, gets depressed, runs away from her friends and family, and basically considers herself worthless. Then Toph gives her a speech that allows her to remove the metal and Jinorra shows up and says that the world needs her. She gets to be powerful and be the avatar again and she's fine. \n\nI think if something were to happen and she were to lose her powers again she'd go back to being a miserable wretch who considered herself worthless cause she's still the same girl from S1 who can't cope with being weak and places all her self worth in her role as the avatar. \n", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh6e", "qSentId": 29403, "question": "Until Books 3 and 4.

All of their issues are resolved off-screen in a way that's kind of implausible and has nothing to do with the main characters.\n \nThere's still anti-bender sentiments throughout the series; Korra gets banished from Republic City in Book 3 for this very reason. Yeah a lot of it was solved off screen because what more is there for the main characters to do? Their leader was exposed as a fraud, their movement fragmented. The only reason the Equalists held together was because of Amon, in classic autocratic sense. \n\nBut the Equalists were just a gateway to the more prevalent theme of 'anti-Avatar.' \n\n&gt; Yeah and then in the opening to Book 4 they totally are and have figured out how to do it off-screen without any input from Korra or it ever really being explained.\n\nBook 4 shows them living together (because they have to, it's unavoidable with the spirit portals left open), but definitely not in harmony. There's a whole plot where the spirit wilds in Republic City start attacking and capturing people. Plus there's another side-story about Korra trying to enlist the help of the spirits and them turning their back on her. \n\n&gt; What is Korra insecure about?

What changed about Korra's character in between those attempts except Toph telling her a bunch of nonsense?\n\nThe way I see it, the entire premise of LoK as a whole is 'do we need the avatar?'. There's so many instances of her trying to do the right thing and making it worse, and a growing resentment by the population towards her. This is even directly addressed in I think Book 3, where it discusses her low public approval ratings. \n\nKorra's whole journey in Korra alone was to try and re-discover her identity as the avatar, which up until this point, has defined her. Since she was a kid she's known she was the Avatar and had pressure put on her for her entire life to live up to the legend of Aang. The first few episodes show her going off the radar and trying to live a 'normal' life without the pressures of being the avatar, but is still haunted by demons of her failures.  \n\nAmon showed her that despite being the Avatar, she was powerless against him.\n\nUnalaaq breaks the avatar cycle, making Korra the first avatar of a new cycle, which has got to have caused deep seated issues; imagine being the first avatar in the ENTIRE cycle to fuck up so bad it had to start over.\n\nZaheer makes her question her entire identity as the Avatar by removing her from the picture and encouraging the citizens of the world to forge their own destiny. Kuvira is a direct result of this post-avatar world. The PTSD was largely as a result of Zaheer telling her AND showing her that the world doesn't need the avatar.\n\nResultantly, Korra is insecure about a LOT of things, with Zaheer essentially being the straw that broke the camels back.\n\n&gt; she wants to be the Avatar, she's just too weak to do it\n\nShe's *mentally* weak. She still has the powers she has before, but she's no longer had the focus that she once had because her entire identity has been thrown into question, making her doubt herself and her own abilities. \n \n&gt; She's pretty much fixed emotionally after that, she just has the weird PTSD flashback in the Kuvira fight. Then she goes to Zaheer and he fixes her by telling her to accept the pain and then we see an animation of her going into the spirit world and therefore she did it. Why was she holding on to this pain in the first place? Why hadn't she ever though of letting it go on her own? What changed that allowed her to let go of it?\n\nIdentity crisis paired with genuine mental illness isn't something you can just 'let go of'. Toph's role was to give Korra new purpose as the avatar, and considering Toph's bond with Aang, she was the perfect person to do it. With Toph's guidance, Korra came to accept the fact that while the world no longer necessarily needed the avatar, she could still make a difference in the world. Her removing the remaining mercury was a demonstration of this; Korra overcame her mental block after been given new purpose, by physically and symbolically removing the barrier to overcoming her identity crisis. Even then she's not 'fixed', just better equipped to deal with the world. \n \n&gt; Nothing about AtLA is revolutionary, it's a pretty formulaic plot that just nails all the details. That Zuko is redeemed is not anything special, it's the way they get there that makes it good. Over three season we get to see Zuko re-evaluate who he is and what he wants from life and develop in a way that follows naturally from who he is and what he undergoes. The arc has been done before but it has rarely been done with such patience.\n\nNothing to add here on TLA, I fully agree with you. \n\nZuko and Korra are very similar, in terms of assigning all of their self-worth and identity to one concept; for Zuko it's honour and for Korra it's being the avatar. Throughout the series, these both come under fire and they're forced to reevaluate and discover a new path. \n\nWhen you watch LoK from the thematic standpoint of identity crisis and with the central underlying theme of 'what does it mean to be the Avatar in a world that doesn't want it?', it becomes much more satisfying. Hell, even the love triangle becomes purposeful; young brash avatar thinking she can have it all. \n\n", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh6e", "qSentId": 29475, "question": "Korra was really good at developing adult premises, but then it resolved them in childish ways.

In fact I'd argue that it does a good job of showing us why the non-benders of republic city might have some animosity towards benders. The government, police force, and criminal class are all benders and it takes major political reform before a non-bender can be elected to a position of power. Mako is aware even before the meeting that a lot of people hate benders and Korra herself uses her powers to harass an equalist speechmaker before she knows anything about him except that he hated bending. \n\n&gt; So even within his support network, most people don't fight-- Amon himself was, from the beginning, the only reason the Equalists could exist.\n\nLeaders can't produce revolutions out of nothing, they have to draw on the actual frustration of the masses. Amon is the reason why the growing anti-bender sentiment turned into a militant movement designed to destroy all bending, but he's not the reason why anti-bender sentiment exists.\n\nFurthermore the government cracks down on non-benders and treats them legally as a separate class of citizens. This would only increase anti-bender and anti-government sentiment among non-benders. People aren't fighting only for Amon, they are also genuinely convinced of the justice of their cause. Once Amon goes down the equalist movement could go away (though since all the lieutenants are non benders it seems more likely it would just splinter) but why would the anti-bender sentiment disappear completely? \n\n\nLoK creates a complex political situation, a mass movement driven to militant radicalism by a charismatic leader who only gains more support when the government responds badly by cracking down on non-benders. These are not treated as complicated political/social problems, but as the consequences of the evil of individuals, Tarlock and Amon. They did this again with Kuvira, the fact that she had a massive army of people who followed her and were comitted to the cause doesn't matter once the charismatic leader is destroyed. \n\n\nI guess primarily I'm just sick of people telling me a show that resolves it's political drama by having a teenager be so in love with her boyfriend that she can beat up a political leader is somehow \"adult\". Korra never figures out a way to clevely expose Amon, or resolve the bender non-bender divide. She just loves Mako so much she suddenly gets airbending and punches out Amon. That's not an \"adult\" story that's a very \"teen\" one. \n\nI'm not saying that LoK should have spent S2 detailing the dismantling of equalist splinter groups and enacting legislative reform. Just throw in a scene showing us that part of Korra's growth is her ability to bridge the gap between benders and non-benders and imply that she does that a bunch off-screen once Amon is defeated.

It sets up complicated political and emotional issues and then resolves them in simple and easy ways. Political movements with wide popular support are resolved by beating up their leader (Amon/Kuvira) and complex emotional issues are solved via plot device or inspiration speech (Amnesia in S2, Toph/Zaheer in S4).\n\nFurthermore while Korra's arc looks good on paper, (progression from punch-first hot head to determined mediator) how she actually gets there is pretty contrived. She rarely develops on her own but only grown via plot devices (amnesia) or inspirational speeches from her mentors. Furthermore the climax of her arc (talking Kuvira into surrender) is totally forced (nothing about Kuvira's character suggests she would surrender) and kind of unnecessary (why couldn't Korra just beat her into submission non-lethally like they did to Zaheer). \n\nThe writers also keep toying with the idea of weakening her, but continually undermine that by immeadietly restoring her powers. In S1 she loses her bending but then Aang restores them, S2 she loses Ravaa but then Jinorra restores Ravaa. In S3 they actually make her be weak for a little while but then instead of Korra learning to cope with weakness or learning to be \"Korra\" and not \"the Avatar\" Jinorra shows up and tells her the world needs her again, Toph gives her a speech in which she basically says Korra secretly wants to be weak and Korra gets her powers back. \n\n\n", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh6e", "qSentId": 29628, "question": "Korra isn't more adult at all. \n\nKorra starts with 2 seasons of ridiculous love triangles and teen angst that would rival the worst of the CW shows.\n\nAn unlikeable protagonist and an internet approved final scene do not an adult show make.

During the physical attack Oisin Tymon was struck, resulting in swelling and bleeding to his lip. The verbal abuse was sustained over a longer period, both at the time of the physical attack and subsequently.\nSpecific facts I have found as part of my investigation are as follows:\nEarlier on 4 March, studio recording of Top Gear had taken place in Surrey and the presenters had travelled that same evening to the location shoot in North Yorkshire.\nThe incident occurred on a patio area of the Simonstone Hall hotel, where Oisin Tymon was working on location for Top Gear.\nThe physical attack lasted around 30 seconds and was halted by the intervention of a witness.\nIt is the case that Oisin Tymon offered no retaliation.\nThe verbal abuse was directed at Oisin Tymon on more than one occasion \u2013 both during the attack and subsequently inside the hotel \u2013 and contained the strongest expletives and threats to sack him. The abuse was at such volume as to be heard in the dining room, and the shouting was audible in a hotel bedroom.\nDerogatory and abusive language, relating to Oisin Tymon and other members of the Top Gear team, continued to be used by Jeremy Clarkson inside the hotel, in the presence of others, for a sustained period of time.\nIt is clear that Oisin Tymon was shocked and distressed by the incident, and believed that he had lost his job.\nFollowing the attack, I understand that Oisin Tymon drove to a nearby A&amp;E department for examination.\nOver the subsequent days, Jeremy Clarkson made a number of attempts to apologise to Oisin Tymon by way of text, email and in person.\nAnd it is the case that Jeremy Clarkson reported the incident to BBC management.\nIt was not disputed by Jeremy Clarkson or any witness that Oisin Tymon was the victim of an unprovoked physical and verbal attack. It is also clear to me that Oisin Tymon is an important creative member of the Top Gear team who is well-valued and respected. He has suffered significant personal distress as a result of this incident, through no fault of his own.\n\nBut I'm sure it's still OK to shit on everyone that's defending the moron that punched his coworker because they feel it shouldn't be compared to an fucking psycho almost killing his girlfriend.", "aSentId": 31531, "answer": "I'm not sure what your message is saying or what you think my viewpoint is?

The decision makers at the BBC has to ask themselves- do we have a spine? Do we treat people equally regardless of their stature?
