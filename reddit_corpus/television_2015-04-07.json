The one evolving plot that I actually care about is the island and what happen, the mystery reminds me of the tv show Lost.\n\nI think at this point I'm tired of formula of solve a case of murder in one episode on to the next one every episode, in this case it's kill a bad guy, on to the next one in the next episode. \n\nThe twist with his mother isn't really anything new, just the same twist that any day time tv show would have or novella really ha. \n\nReason Game of Throne is good is that there's an on going plot, white walking coming, oh shit dragon girl coming.

The Underwoods were fantastic, and Zoe and Peter were both interesting in their own ways.\n\nSeason two had better pacing and fewer meandering plots, but the overarching story let it down. Walker, Remy and Tusk never felt like actual threats to Frank. The ending of the season felt like a foregone conclusion. Frank and Claire were still brilliant characters and compelling enough to carry the season, but I don't think it lived up to season one.\n\nSeason three again felt like a bit of a step-down. Given how season two ended this season was always going to feel different, and to their credit I think the writers had some great ideas. Frank really struggles in his new role, and Petrov felt like a genuine adversary for him. However, I think there were three major missteps. \n\nFirstly, [](#s \"while the conflict between the Underwoods was a good idea the execution was poor. I felt like their undermined Claire's character just for the sake of forcing the Underwoods apart.

I think the story would've been more interesting if Frank's no longer had his fail-safe to fall back on.\")\n\nThirdly, I think the season spent too much time on minor characters rather than on the central pair. A lot of time was spent on Remy, Jackie, Gavin, [](#s \"Doug\"), and Tom Yates, and while I appreciate that they want to flesh out the side characters I think the amount of time spent on them was unnecessary.  \n\n---\n\nSeason three was still good, and I'd still recommend the show, but I think it peaked in its first season.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh6e", "qSentId": 35565, "question": "Toast of London.

It was due in large part to just not having the cast together to film so there wasn't as much interplay, callbacks to jokes (because those characters the jokes \"belong to\" weren't in the scene/episode), and immediacy to the funny.\n\nThink of a scene that was meh when Lindsay is meeting with some old man. Later, we find it funny because the \"old man\" is actually Maeby in disguise, but the scene itself wasn't funny in the original introduction episode. In seasons 1-3 we would have seen all of that happen in one episode and it would have been funnier because of that. When the episodes are split up but we're still seeing the same scenes it's more \"Oh, so that's how/why that happened\" than actual laughter because the setup and payoff are sososo far apart in many cases.\n\nThat's what people mean when they say that immediacy was sacrificed for long plays.

At least to me I just felt like I was being pandered to without much effort on their part. \n\nAnother problem I had was that every situation in season 1-3 seemed in the realms of realism and nothing the characters did seemed that out of the ordinary. In season 4, we had the characters transform to revolve around their ridiculous story lines. That is what made season 1-3 so great, it wasn't that it was hilarious, it was that the story came first and great jokes were made from the story making the characters believable and relatable. It seemed like they made the jokes first in season 4 and made a story to revolve around that and it makes the world seem much less realistic and believable.

This totally broke up the timing and ensemble performance ping pong that made the show so great.\n\n\n2.) The episodes were WAY TOO LONG. The show always benefited from being 22-ish minutes long, with lots of small character moments, and snappy jokes.\n\n\n3.) The \"subtle\" background jokes were not actually that subtle, and didn't do anything for me beyond \"oh, right, Gob was there earlier... cool...\"\n\n\n4.)

Such an air of \"well you just didn't get it.\" No, I got it, I just didn't think it was funny, like at all. Yes, I've watched it multiple times (since I religiously rewatch the entire series on the regs). And yes, my opinion hasn't wavered that I just didn't like it at all. Not because I didn't get it, but because of the following: \n\n\n1.) The characters were in silos the entire season with minimal interaction beyond random one on one scenes. This totally broke up the timing and ensemble performance ping pong that made the show so great.\n\n\n2.) The episodes were WAY TOO LONG. The show always benefited from being 22-ish minutes long, with lots of small character moments, and snappy jokes.\n\n\n3.) The \"subtle\" background jokes were not actually that subtle, and didn't do anything for me beyond \"oh, right, Gob was there earlier... cool...\"\n\n\n4.) I really don't think the characters benefited from becoming \"long-form drama characters\" as you put it. The characters are shallow by design, in service of the comedy of the show. Injecting pathos to make them deeper just doesn't really resonate with me.\n\n\nAnyway, all I'm saying is that people who didn't like the season have legitimate complaints and it's kind of disrespectful when people dismiss them by saying essentially \"lol, u didn't get it.\" Your comment was actually pretty mild (though your third paragraph really annoyed me) so I don't know why it set me off as I scroll down. I just hate the casual air of condescension that has come about in the Arrested Development fanbase.\n\n\n\nTL;DR Some people hate/dislike season 4 for perfectly legit reasons.

Yes, I've watched it multiple times (since I religiously rewatch the entire series on the regs). And yes, my opinion hasn't wavered that I just didn't like it at all. Not because I didn't get it, but because of the following:\n\n\n1.) The characters were in silos the entire season with minimal interaction beyond random one on one scenes. This totally broke up the timing and ensemble performance ping pong that made the show so great.\n\n\n2.) The episodes were WAY TOO LONG. The show always benefited from being 22-ish minutes long, with lots of small character moments, and snappy jokes.\n\n\n3.) The \"subtle\" background jokes were not actually that subtle, and didn't do anything for me beyond \"oh, right, Gob was there earlier... cool...\"\n\n\n4.) I really don't think the characters benefited from becoming \"long-form drama characters\" as you put it. The characters are shallow by design, in service of the comedy of the show. Injecting pathos to make them deeper just doesn't really resonate with me.\n\n\nAnyway, all I'm saying is that people who didn't like the season have legitimate complaints and it's kind of disrespectful when people dismiss them by saying essentially \"lol, u didn't get it.\" I hate the casual air of condescension that has come about in the Arrested Development fanbase.\n\n\nTL;DR Some people hate/dislike season 4 for perfectly legit reasons.

I didn't know they abused people until I joined reddit. You ask like she knows first hand what they do and agrees with such behavior. I'm sure her experiences have been nothing but great. And maybe she does hear about it and she asks someone about it. Well as an outsider we know Scientology as a cult so we know how cults and twist people's think. How they've probably told her the media doesn't understand and people are just trying to cause issues. And then they ask her \"how has your time in the church been?\" \"Great,\" she says. \"Have you seen anyone being abused or hear anyone say they were abused personally?\" \"No,\" she says. \"If people were being abused wouldn't the police come?\" they ask her,\"where are the police?\" \"They're aren't any,\" she says. \"Exactly that's how you know it's just lies and misunderstandings,\" they say and she goes home happy and reassured. \n\nBut seriously though why aren't the police or someone involved? You assume that they are abusing people based on testimony yet nothing is done about it. So how do you prove to Moss that there is abuse because you can't expect her to read the same news articles you do. Like I said I didn't know about the abuse until I saw it on reddit so before that someone could have been like \"hey I'm in this church called Scientology and I think it'd really help.\" \"Okay,\" I say knowing nothing about the church. I go and what do I see happy friendly people who help make me happy and feel better about myself. No red flags suggesting abuse, everyone is perfectly happy. So why would I believe this organization of happy people making me feel better about myself are secretly abusing people especially when no action is being taken to stop said abuse? \n\nSo you can't assume that she's ok with abuse when her experience of the church is completely different then yours. Again I'm not saying that it's not a horrible cult but you can't assume that she acknowledges of has any reason to acknowledge that it's a horrible cult when her own experience don't back up what you believe. That why you can't always judge someone based on association. You and her could have read the exact same articles and watched the same shows and the only difference is you believe and she doesn't.

In the same way that Moss can't be held accountable for the actions of the church leaders.

You're placing the blame of a few, on the many. It's like saying a woman that goes to a catholic church in Kansas should know about child abuse that's happening in Ireland and should feel responsible otherwise it reflects badly on her. What the woman in Kansas does and believes has nothing to do with child abuse so why should she be viewed in a negative light. If a person associates themselves as a citizen of the United States should they be viewed negatively because the USA used to have slaves and has water boarded people? What does that have to do with average citizen? Why should they be pushed for associating with the United States and any crimes again humanity it part takes in? They didn't own slaves or water board \"terrorists\". Basically what I'm getting at is that what Elizabeth Moss believe and what she gets out of Scientology has nothing to do with abuse. What is she expected to do, ask the leaders if they are abusing people? They are going to deny it of course. What then? Should she go to every Scientology owned property and open even door just to make sure otherwise she's a bad person. Should the woman in Kansas fly to every church in the world to make sure abuse isn't happening, should everyone American go to every facility to make sure no one is being water boarded? \n\nI'm not saying what Scientology, Catholic Church and the USA have done is right, I'm saying you can't blame everyone for what only a few do. You can't say that because Moss belongs to Scientology that she's some how pro-abuse. Leaders like Miscavige, there is a piece of shit that can be blamed. Moss just goes in, pays her money, does basically talk therapy and goes home a happier person. She's not sitting in on meeting where they talk about how they abuse people every day. \n\nAnd I understand where you're coming from I had the whole \"not her,\" reaction but that's my personal bias against Scientology and has nothing to do with what she does for Scientology and what she gets.

It appears, based on available evidence, that celebrity adherents receive privileged treatment and perks at the hands of common folks working at near-slave wages (not to mention the reports of terrible mistreatment).

You can't argue the agency did something wrong when they didn't do something illegal in the first place. They used the tools available to them to do their job. If you are making a **morality** argument, then you better **start protesting the US Post Office** because they read every envelope's TO and FROM line, which is your **metadata** and they put it on their website, they put it in databases, and allow their employees to access it without background checks. The Post Office knows everyone you ever sent a package to and whoever sent you a package or envelope (that's metadata about YOU, but as established, metadata about you is not YOUR property and it's not YOUR data; it's their property and their metadata). So your metadata is not as private as you might believe. No matter how badly you want it to be private, it is not determined by society as private and that moral argument was lost many times in the courts.\n\nThink about metadata like this: If I witness you going into a bakery on November 22. Then I give the police the data about how you went into the bakery on November 22 after writing it down in my database. That is me giving METADATA about YOU, to the police. You don't own my memories. You don't own my metadata about you. It is my data. It is not your privacy being violated.\n\nA security camera recording you on the public street is metadata about you. It is not your private property. And the owner of the security camera can give their metadata about you, to anyone they like or they can write about it in their own logs if they feel like it and then give it to whomever. That is their data. Not your privacy.\n\nMetadata collection has been a legitimate part of law enforcement (let alone spy agencies) to collect information about potential criminals, potential terrorists that might be hiding among the civilian population who may be in contact with actual FBI-Most-Wanted or other known criminals. Most of the other stuff Snowden revealed was information collected from foreign lands and that is exactly what the job of a spy agency is and it's absolutely their goal and mission and no one even hides that. At any moment right now there could be 100s of spy agencies around the world that are collecting information about you if you are communicating with foreign servers. It's not something that's going to go away or be made illegal and will never be considered immoral.\n\nIf you weren't in constant contact with a known criminal then the metadata program cannot affect you negatively. It cannot be used to prosecute you in a court of law by itself alone as Smith v. Maryland established that protection of citizens. It is mainly used to uncover unidentified/hidden terrorists and spies who are not yet known to the spy agencies. That is why it's useful to them.

I don't think the issue needs to be dumbed down so the average American can understand it. That argument implies the average American is too stupid to understand it and I don't think that is the case.\n\nI think the real problem is that the average American isn't interested in investing time into understanding the whole issue. This is due to several things. First, the average American views themselves as largely insignificant on international scales. Even if you believe the government probably has the ability to scan, store and listen to all forms of your communications, if you view yourself as insignificant to international spying affairs then it's easy to brush off that ability as also being insignificant as it pertains to you. So what if they have a record of all your texts? Who are you and what do your texts have to do with international security, is the end conclusion due to that line of thinking. As such, the average American doesn't divert any of their attention to to the subject. They are capable of understanding it, they just don't invest any time to it because they don't see how it pertains to them personally. \n\nThere's also as matter of trust. For the most part, the average American trusts their government. Not only do they view themselves as unimportant to national affairs, they also don't view themselves as a legitimate threat to the government and therefore can't imagine the government they trust doing anything nefarious to them. Again, because of this, it is yet another reason not to spend a lot of time on the issue. \n\nThere's also the matter of the average American fearing for their safety. Even though you are significantly more likely to die of cancer or in a car wreck than to be harmed in a genuine terrorist attack, the few terrorist attacks that do take place are the stories that receive all the media attention. This causes people to believe the risks are much higher than they really are. And this leads the average American to come to the conclusion that even if the government they trust is collecting all of their mundane texts and emails which might contain some potentially embarrassing information of no consequence to international affaires, the risk is worth it if it keeps them safe from the horrible stories about terror threats they see in the news everyday. Once again, because of this, they don't invest a lot of time reading about government spying operations. They aren't stupid. They could understand it. They just don't see how it pertains to them, and if they don't see that, they aren't going to waste a lot of time on the issue.\n\nMy whole point is this. If you waste a lot of time dumbing an issue down for people who are capable of understanding an issue but currently don't care about or see how it pertains to them, it's just going to make the issue seem that much more insignificant. If you frame the issue as if it's biggest threat is the idea that someone might see your dick pics, then compared to national security it still seems insignificant. The takeaway isn't \"we should do something about the scope of government spying\" and instead becomes, \"I probably shouldn't share pictures of my dick\".\n\nI like John Oliver. I enjoy the comedy.

You don't need the stupid on your side. The stupid don't vote anyway. What you need to do is frame the issue in such away that the average, reasonably intelligent American understands that it does pertain to them, that is is a threat to them and their future security.
