Alternatively, suppose that the pattern is really crazy, but we have a fixed oracle, then the oracle would also do bad because it is restricted to only having the same choice each round. If the best prize is behind door 1 every time, then we would eventually latch onto that pattern and, although we might not have gotten the correct door the first few rounds, we are now doing as well as the oracle for the rest of the game. Fixing the oracle basically induces your strategy to one like \"if we see the best prize behind door 1 for twenty turns in a row, we should probably choose door 1.\" \n\nThere are other, less common, oracle settings that are also studied. Maybe you only let the oracle change every 20 turns, then you would be comparing to a setting where \"the door pattern changes, but only occasionally\". Also you could only let the oracle change the door value by one each round, which would correspond with \"the pattern changes constantly, but only by a little bit.\"", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qhmr", "qSentId": 60345, "question": "What is a \"no-regret learning algorithm\"?

Competing predictor algorithms are functionally equivalent to certain kinds of networks though.

They compete to generate the strongest prediction for the entire network.\n\nI think the reason that \"no regret\" learning isn't used much in neural networks is that it's usually only done as a precursor to the main event. Once you have a somewhat well-tuned neural network, you want to keep applying the usual back-propagation for both success and failure to refine it further. Avoiding demotion entirely in the early stages doesn't really get you anything in terms of optimal results that you can't get with more iterations of your normal training. It's just a shortcut to saving computation time when you're identifying which connections you want to use in the network you start training normally, if you're dealing with what will ultimately be a sparse network.

Now by the pidgeonhole principle, there must be numbers `i` and `j` with `i != j` and so that `a^i` and `a^j` bring the automaton in the same state.  Note that the automaton will accept `a^i^b^i` and `a^jb^j` (by how the language is defined).  But since after consuming `a^i` it is in the same state as consuming `a^j`, it will also accept `a^jb^i`, which is not in the language, which contradicts our assumption.\n\n(I suspect that this is a special case of the solution /u/Triple_Elation gives.)", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qhmr", "qSentId": 60387, "question": "I'm hoping this isn't a homework question and you're genuinely curious. \n\nIf you align your states vertically and start at q\\_0 (which also happens to be the final state), you can let q\\_1, q\\_2 be the states with 1 and 2 more 1's than 0's respectively. Similarly q\\_-1 and q\\_-2 will be the states where you have 1 and 2 more 0's than 1's respectively.\n\nNow to accept the string 1^2 0^2, you'll need up to state q\\_2.

They are distinguish by PID.  In a traditional fork this means copying the memory in use by the parent when creating the child.  This can be quite expensive, especially for large processes.\n\nCopy-On-Write avoids this expense by being lazy.  Rather than copy all the memory at once it pretends it was copied and only actually copies when the parent and child need to hold different values at the same address.  The child is presented with a view of memory by having the virtual memory segments backed by the same physical memory as the parent.  If either process writes to memory the parent retains the physical page and the child is given a new one with the correct value stored.\n\n&gt; In COW, when a fork call is made, it creates a child process that has pointers to the parent's frames in memory so as to not create redundant data. In this case, it reduces copying. Is this correct?\n\nCOW happens below the abstraction of pointers in the virtual memory system.  Since fork() is a system call the work is done by the OS kernel, outside the programmer's hands.  Processes are given virtual memory space by the kernel, numbered 0 through 2^64 (these days).  Each process can't write to memory address 0 to start their space or they would all write to the same addresses and overwrite each other.  So the kernel creates virtual memory pages and maps them to physical addresses.  When a process asks for address 0 that is translated to a physical address and retrieved.  That translation happens outside the process memory space, so as far as your program is concerned it isn't taking place.  All the pointers in your program still only point to memory inside your process address space.  COW is done by the kernel in the background by using the same physical page for both parent and child.  If either writes to the memory a 2nd page is allocated so both versions can be stored.\n\nCOW is the clever way to reduce copying memory on fork() by using the abstraction of virtual memory.  It's worth noting there are now filesystems and databases that use the same abstraction to handle graceful rollbacks and data guarantees.  Before COW was a common OS ability the classic unix way to avoid the expense of fork() was to only fork() tiny processes.  If you look at daemons that fork to handle incoming connections the actual amount of code is pretty minimal.\n\n&gt;I have come to the understanding that when a fork() command is called, the child process executes an exec() call and abandons the copied memory\n\nfork-exec is for executing new programs but it isn't required.  It involves calling fork and then the child calling exec to start a new (different) program.  It's how shells actually run commands.  If you just call fork you end up with 2 processes running the same program (which is actually more useful than it sounds.  Lots of daemons fork on connection, the child handles the connection and then dies).", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qhmr", "qSentId": 60435, "question": "Trying to understand fork() and Copy-on-Write (COW)", "aSentId": 60438, "answer": "your assumption is correct.

Likewise, it means 0 is not a valid 1-bit symbol.\n\nThis is what you naturally get if you visualize the set of all symbols as a binary tree where any path from the root to a leaf node represents a valid symbol.

It's just a proof to show that it can be done, but it has the unfortunate side effect that many people think that that's how you actually do it, leading to the belief that Huffman codes are extremely slow. The simplest (both to explain why it works and to code) alternative, is to make a table of length 2 to the power of the length of the longest codeword (which in practice, and *for this reason*, will typically be limited to something for which this table won't be too big - say 15), you will always read that many bits (without necessarily advancing the read pointer by that much) and treat it as an index in that table. The entries of the table are tuples of the length of first codeword (so you can advance the read pointer by the right amount) in it and the corresponding symbol (which you output).
