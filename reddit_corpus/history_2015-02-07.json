It doesn't change the fact that their state was founded on and justified through racial \"science\" and war.\n\nBut please, list some more then since you clearly have a whole sack of them ready to go.","aSentId": 31303,"answer": "If I could, I would totally gold you right now.

Marriage wasn't even recognized as a Sacrament by the Church until the Late Middle Ages. \n\nPeasants were occasionally required by the Lord to fight in wars, often for months at a time, though the campaigning season was generally kept short as even the Lords depended on the peasants to grow the food. Peasants would be sent to war, in battle, armed with no armor or weapons aside from farm equipment. In battle, their lives mattered little. \n\nActually, the Black Death was the best thing to happen to Europe's peasantry. With a third to a half of the population dead, labor became quite expensive and peasants were suddenly able to negotiate. Plus many manors were left abandoned, allowing peasants to squat their way to land ownership.\n\nAdult peasants were probably a more physically fit than modern First World citizens, as they worked all day. Though disease, parasites and tooth loss were common. They had more leisure time than we modern people, but less interesting things to fill it with. Reading, travel, or interesting food were unknown to them. For the most part they were ignored by the government, but they had no say over their lot in life, were essentially owned by the Lord of the Manor, had virtually no legal rights plus corporal or capital punishment was common for even the most minor crimes. \n\nNow the during the following centuries, you're correct that very little changed for the lower classes. Though post-Black Death saw the rise of a Middle Class of merchants, traders and craftsman which brought about a huge social change. The Protestant Reformation believe that each individual should read the Bible in their own language (during the Middle Ages it was only read in Latin and people who translated it to other languages were often killed), which lead to a greater push for education even of the lower classes. The Age of Discovery brought new foods, goods and money to Europe, and furthered the development of the Middle Class. After the 30 Years War, the Peace of Westphalia essentially created the idea of the nation state, which lead to more standardized bureaucracy and better rights for the lower classes. The Enlightenment's ideas of science and inquiry, along with the spread of movable type printing, increased literacy. Human rights became a thing during the 17th Century and many thinkers and writers spread the idea that even the lowliest and poorest still had natural rights that the powerful had to respect. The steam engine made long distance travel cheaper and eventually brought it within reach of the poor. \n\nYes, during those later periods, it still wasn't good to be poor, but there was a gradual upward trend toward a better standard of living for the poor. This is a trend that is still ongoing throughout the world. For the past few hundred years, the poor could look and see that they were better off than the poor of the previous century. Let's hope it's a trend that continues.  \n\nTLDR- No. They were not better off than us.

Against these enormous numbers the Americans had thirty or forty Green Beret conducting reconnaissance in Laos and Cambodia at any given time. On half of their missions they had to fight their way out.\nIt was late morning when Recon Team Maine's helicopter landed on a slash-and- burn clearing about 15 miles inside Laos, near Highway 165. Additional troop helicopters, gunships and A-1 Skyraiders hung back just beyond earshot, ready to intervene in case of trouble.\nTheir helicopter lifted away. The leader of the team headed for a woodline, then froze - everyone froze - just ahead were bunkers and milling groups of North Vietnamese soldiers. The leader backed away, turned for another woodline and saw it, too, bristling with men and heavy earth-and-log bunkers - Communist soldiers were EVERYWHERE.\nThe recon team was totally surrounded on an open landing zone, outnumbered perhaps twenty to one by an entrenched enemy, overlooked by heavy machine guns whose bolts they now heard slamming shut. By any reckoning, the leader and his seven men had about ten seconds to live. Mike Buckland tersely radioed an airplane circling overhead, \"Have inserted into a major unit and not yet engaged. Stand by.\"\nBut the NVA just stood there watching, some only 20 yards away. The Green Beret leader made a shrewd observation: the Communists had bomb shelters, not fighting bunkers. These lacked firing ports, so the NVA couldn't shoot from inside and had to climb out even to see, silhouetting their heads and shoulders like targets in a shooting gallery.\nMeanwhile a half-dozen enemy leaders marched from deeper in the bunker area with an indignant \"we'll get-to-the-bottom-of-this\" air about them. Maybe, just maybe, their unmarked helicopter had been mistaken for a similar-looking Russian helicopter used by the North Vietnamese. Buckland smiled, waved and called out reassuringly in Russian.\nMore NVA were standing atop bunkers now, craning necks like gawkers at a traffic accident. They didn't even point their AK-47's at the team. The Green Beret let the Communist officers approach to the edge of the woodline, only fifteen paces away. Then all three Americans opened fire, and the Communist's commanders were history.\nStunned NVA machine gunners grabbed their guns but did not fire, unable to believe what had happened. The Green Beret annihilated them. So astounded were the NVA that the Americans fired a full ten seconds before the enemy shot back, but then it turned into a melee. They cleaned the bunker tops again, then lay down in a slight depression. The cross fire was so heavy the Vietnamese began shooting each other.\nThe Communists launched three human wave assaults, each one beaten back. Bullets smacked into the backpacks they were using for cover, then a bullet tore a radio receiver from the leader's hand. He picked it back up and called for napalm before they were overrun. Fifteen Communists jumped to their feet, shouting and dashing and firing just as a fighter-bomber rolled in.\nThen a bouncing 750-pound napalm canister split apart so close it spewed petroleum-smelling globs on the recon team's backpacks and weapons and on Mike Buckland's hands and shirt. An instant later the napalm burst hot orange all around them and set ablaze backpacks and a Montagnard's rifle. They felt the air sucked away as black smoke blocked the sun, and inside its shadow the Communists disappeared.\nThe napalm globs on the recon team's men did not ignite. Buckland recalled a verse from Isaiah: \"When you walk through fire, you shall not be burned.\" The fighter bombers pushed back the North Vietnamese and a helicopter snatched the Green Beret team away from the landing zone. Only one man was superficially hurt.","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh53","qSentId": 31738,"question": "Soviet Involvement in Vietnam","aSentId": 31743,"answer": "From what Ive heard from friends who were in country the Russians also flew their migs in combat","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh53","qSentId": 31748,"question": "Currently traveling through Vietnan.

Cato lived from 234 BCE \u2013 149 BCE, Middle Republic, Plutarch from 46 CE - 120 CE, Early Empire, roughly 300 years later.\n\n(Bolding mine)\n\n\n&gt;He tells us that he never wore clothing worth more than a hundred drachmas; that he drank, even when he was praetor or consul, the same wine as his slaves; that as for fish and meats, he would buy thirty asses' worth for his dinner from the public stalls, and even this for the city's sake, that he might not live on bread alone, but strengthen his body for military service; that he once fell heir to an embroidered Babylonian robe, but sold it at once; that not a single one of his cottages had plastered walls; **that he never paid more than fifteen hundred drachmas for a slave, since he did not want them to be delicately beautiful, but sturdy workers, such as grooms and herdsmen, and these he thought it his duty to sell when they got oldish, instead of feeding them when they were useless**; and that in general, he thought nothing cheap that one could do without, but that what one did not need, even if it cost but a penny, was dear; also that he bought lands where crops were raised and cattle herded, not those where lawns were sprinkled and paths swept.\n\n\n&gt;These things were ascribed by some to the man's parsimony; but others condoned them in the belief that he lived in this contracted way only to correct and moderate the extravagance of others. However, for my part, **I regard his treatment of his slaves like beasts of burden, using them to the uttermost, and then, when they were old, driving them off and selling them, as the mark of a very mean nature, which recognizes no tie between man and man but that of necessity.** And yet we know that kindness has a wider scope than justice. Law and justice we naturally apply to men alone; but when it comes to beneficence and charity, these often flow in streams from the gentle heart, like water from a copious spring, even down to dumb beasts. A kindly man will take good care of his horses even when they are worn out with age, and of his dogs, too, not only in their puppyhood, but when their old age needs nursing.\n\n\n&gt;We should not treat living creatures like shoes or pots and pans, casting them aside when they are bruised and worn out with service, but, if for no other reason, **for the sake of practice in kindness to our fellow men, we should accustom ourselves to mildness and gentleness in our dealings with other creatures. I certainly would not sell even an ox that had worked for me, just because he was old, much less an elderly man, removing him for his habitual place and customary life, as it were from his native land, for a paltry price, useless as he is to those who sell him and as he will be to those who buy him.** But Cato, exulting as it were in such things, says that he left in Spain even the horse which had carried him through his consular campaign, that he might not tax the city with the cost of its transportation. Whether, now, these things should be set down to greatness of spirit or littleness of mind, is an open question.

But Augustus intervened, and treated the master as a slave. Thus, Augustus established that his supreme authority over all walks of life extended even to contravening otherwise acceptable household orders on a whim. By ordering the eel pond filled in, Augustus made the master himself a slave. So Augustus is the supreme authority both within and over each household, which the author correctly identifies as the cornerstone of Roman society (although I would humbly posit that for now, at least, the household remains the cornerstone of American society as well).\n\nFar from signifying the wise, slave-valuing wisdom Augusti, the passage reflects his unquestioned and total dominance over all aspects of Roman society. More precisely, it reflects the change from the old Republican system--as no consul or even dictator would have dared intervene in the household affairs of a senator in that manner. My guess is that the intended audience of the passage was probably provincial aristocracy, who had to be (repeatedly) reminded that serious consequences would follow if they threatened the authority of the local magistrate, who collected taxes on behalf of the central state (that is, 'pay your taxes or I'll fill in your eel pit').","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh53","qSentId": 31950,"question": "Are we at the point where we just except our role as slaves in the corporate world?

There was some experimentation with enslaving Indians, and the English even enslaved and traded Irish people for about 90 years in the 17th century, but by the time of the civil war, American slavery was all about black slaves (though importation of fresh slaves from Africa had long been illegal).\n\nRomans--and most other slavers--didn't care what your skin color was or where you were born (indeed, the modern notion of \"race\" and its attendant superior/inferior baggage did not emerge until about the 18th century). Slaves were typically originally captured in wars or raids, but the Romans were equally happy to make other inhabitants of that land full Roman citizens, as long as they accepted Roman authority.\n\nIt's worth noting that the Egyptians also did not enslave by ethnicity, and there is no historical evidence that they ever held any large number of Hebrew slaves. The pyramids and later monuments were built by well-paid voluntary workers.\n\nRoman slavery was also considerably more flexible than American slavery, there were more opportunities for slaves to work or buy their way out of slavery, and once they became free, there was not the inherent racial bigotry faced by free blacks in America.\n\nFinally, the Romans eventually learned an important lesson about slavery: it's bad for the economy. The Romans were such prolific enslavers that more and more of the work was being done by slaves, and free Roman citizens couldn't find jobs. They eventually had to pass laws that limited the amount of certain types of work--such as construction--that could be done by slaves.\n\n\n\n","corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh53","qSentId": 31969,"question": "How did American slavery differ from Roman slavery?","aSentId": 31972,"answer": "In ancient Rome, rather than giving unwanted children up for adoption, you could just leave them out wherever and the slavers would come by and pick them up. \n\nAmerican Slavery was interesting because slaves were one color and freemen were a different color.

For example, in WW2, bombing Germany did not slow down German war production.  It did, however, result in air superiority for the allies over Europe, because over years of bombing it forced Germany to send up a lot of pilots, inevitably some of these got killed, and it takes two years to make a pilot.  You can't speed that up.  Planes?  The Germans were producing just as many fighter planes in April of 1945 as they were in 1939.

Ball-bearing or aircraft production factories are very hard to destroy by bombing.  Once the Allies hit on the right target (petroleum production) the German war machine ground to a halt.
