Do you have anything else that shows you that he can be? Because the playoff win, even if he did win it for them with crazy heroics, is only one win, and the other stat you really can't use against them because you don't know how many playoff games tebow would win if he had played 4 or 5.

I was speaking on the topic from a \"all sports\" perspective as the person I replied to used evidence only of a single person running on a treadmill and was talking about its performance impact. That being said it still is prohibited under NSAC rules as it is under WADA. It falls under \"prohibited in competition\" which requires metabolites to be over a threshold (theoretically to show use within 12 hours prior to competition). Nicotine and caffeine are simply monitored (by the WADA, I don't know if the NSCA monitors anything though the Jones \"WADA Full Menu\" lab report seems to indicate that they do) which means there is no threshold, the levels are recorded only for statistics and are anonymous (in theory).  \n\nI just think it is wrong to only monitor multiple ergogenic aides while prohibiting cannabinoids though could understand testing for them to prevent impairment....not as a performance enhancer based on the evidence.
