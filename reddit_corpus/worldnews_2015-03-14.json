Yes, some 3rd party candidates do get elected on the state and local level, but they require a majority in those districts. If that same district votes to elect a 3rd party candidate in a federal election but the majority voted candidate is the only representation they get they are not being represented on a federal level. I haven't donated my time to candidates and the party I support, but I do donate money to allow them to market the candidates and the party. More people would vote and vote for people representing their interests if more people were active in politics, I agree with you there. But when incumbent party candidates can refuse to debate minority candidates or when someone replies that my argument for third party voting is throwing your vote away without minority representation it's hard to argue with the current electoral systems in place supporting no minority representation.\n\nThis isn't a problem you can put entirely on the voter and individual political action. Minority political representation shouldn't have more power than the majority, but it should have *some* representation, and if you can only enact reform through politicians elected by the existing system good luck getting any meaningful reform to allow the minority to have a minority voice instead of no voice.  John Stuart Mill says it better than I can:\n\n\"In a representative body actually deliberating, the minority must of course be overruled; and in an equal democracy, the majority of the people, through their representatives, will outvote and prevail over the minority and their representatives. But does it follow that the minority should have no representatives at all? ... Is it necessary that the minority should not even be heard? Nothing but habit and old association can reconcile any reasonable being to the needless injustice. In a really equal democracy, every or any section would be represented, not disproportionately, but proportionately.

This allows us to compare and contrast other countries with our own, verifying that we do, in fact, have decent rights.\n2. You are able to travel to a location outside of the U.S. if you desire, unlike NK. Once again, this allows you to compare other countries with your own. And if for some reason you find the U.S. particularly objectionable, you can always move somewhere else. Once again, North Koreans do not have this option.\n3. As far as the brain washing at school, that's frankly kind of ridiculous. I remember elementary school, and I can't remember a single instance wherein I was told to believe something that would be beneficial for the U.S. to have me believe. In fact, I remember being taught a lot about what the U.S. did actually do wrong. Also, you could actually think for a minute that the U.S. government could actually get every single teacher ever to \"brain wash\" their students? Brain washing involves the repetitive enforcement of ideas, and it's very, very hard to imagine that every single teacher would be capable of performing this brain washing without realizing  what was happening. It's possible that there is some amount of positive reinforcement of the U.S. in elementary school, but I think it is very minor and in no way influences a person's decisions once they reach adulthood. Besides, who doesn't want to be a little biased towards their own country? It's where they live, after all. Also, the capability to access the internet and travel allows us to check with citizens of other countries if we want a completely unadulterated evaluation of the U.S. Besides, it's not like I have a completely positive view of the U.S., despite going to elementary school. I think some of the military decisions we make are incredibly short-sighted and foolish, and our internet sucks compared to a lot of other countries. \n4. Also, I certainly do know that I have freedom to an extent. The U.S. makes your rights very clear, and punishment for your crimes is determined by a *jury of your peers.* Although there are restrictions on what is considered legal, you can always move to a country that with different laws that allows you to do what it is that you want. Laws exist for a reason; complete freedom would be ridiculously chaotic. I suppose you could say I believed this because of \"brain washing,\" but I myself know some people who would do some rather unethical stuff if they knew they would get away with it.\n\nBasically, the suggestion that the U.S. is anything like North Korea is frankly ridiculous and I really, really hope you were saying this in a joking manner.

As far as the brain washing at school, that's frankly kind of ridiculous. I remember elementary school, and I can't remember a single instance wherein I was told to believe something that would be beneficial for the U.S. to have me believe. In fact, I remember being taught a lot about what the U.S. did actually do wrong. Also, you could actually think for a minute that the U.S. government could actually get every single teacher ever to \"brain wash\" their students? Brain washing involves the repetitive enforcement of ideas, and it's very, very hard to imagine that every single teacher would be capable of performing this brain washing without realizing  what was happening. It's possible that there is some amount of positive reinforcement of the U.S. in elementary school, but I think it is very minor and in no way influences a person's decisions once they reach adulthood. Besides, who doesn't want to be a little biased towards their own country? It's where they live, after all. Also, the capability to access the internet and travel allows us to check with citizens of other countries if we want a completely unadulterated evaluation of the U.S. Besides, it's not like I have a completely positive view of the U.S., despite going to elementary school. I think some of the military decisions we make are incredibly short-sighted and foolish, and our internet sucks compared to a lot of other countries. \n4. Also, I certainly do know that I have freedom to an extent. The U.S. makes your rights very clear, and punishment for your crimes is determined by a *jury of your peers.* Although there are restrictions on what is considered legal, you can always move to a country that with different laws that allows you to do what it is that you want. Laws exist for a reason; complete freedom would be ridiculously chaotic. I suppose you could say I believed this because of \"brain washing,\" but I myself know some people who would do some rather unethical stuff if they knew they would get away with it.\n\nBasically, the suggestion that the U.S. is anything like North Korea is frankly ridiculous and I really, really hope you were saying this in a joking manner.

Get a general idea or ranking of what you want to see and then go to the tourism office in Reykjavik and iron out the details there. They are an AMAZING resource and will call ahead to small campgrounds and hotels (which are usually either the size of a motel or literally a separate house with rented rooms). Bring good boots and waterproof outer layers, and make sure to break everything in before going. \n\nRead up on the different areas and plan on seeing about 1/2 of what you'd see if you planned meticulously before going. Most of the interesting parts are also hard to reach, and commuting will take a large part of the day. Basically, aim to hit about 1/2-1/4 of the country if you want to actually have some time to hike around and get the full experience.\n\nTo give you an idea, I went with a friend in September (bordering on winter) for my first trip, which lasted 10 days. We hit the West Fjords/Latrabjarg, Snaefellsness peninsula, Reykjavik (Friday/Saturday night), Torsmork, and Skaftafell (glacier park). We drove everywhere, except Skaftafell, which we took a bus for. We were basically on a more strict schedule than I would have liked, but barely made it to all the spots we planned. (West Fjorks are a combination of crazy and boring as a driver - you can literally see where you want to go is 1/4 mile away, but because of all the winding, you know it will take an hour+ to get there!)\n\nOh, and be careful on the rugged interior roads and check maps for river crossings. Not all of them have bridges and the local pubs have walls of pictures of tourists that tried to make it across in subcompacts and failed. Anything along the Ring Road (route 1) should be fine, but some of the interesting hiking spots could be tricky.

Im doing physics, and there are some assholes on my course, and a girl that thinks God played more of a role than is usually accepted, but every single person in my physics group (60 of us as it stands) deserves to pass. We can all write lab papers, keep lab books, reference articles, read articles, are maths literate, can code a little, can analyse data, know how to keep a lab area, are enthusiastic about physics, etc. I keep hearing that \"everyone knows someone who shouldnt have graduated with everyone else\" but I dont. Not in physics. (And before we get any jokes about \"its you!\", Im in the top bracket and expected to get a first, and this is what I have wanted to do since I was 7. Its not me.)", "aSentId": 1944, "answer": "If you're sure it's not you, then continue on with Occam's razor. What is next?\n\nThe simple idea that although you CAN identify competence because you ARE competent, **you are not identifying the incompetence** or **you are unaware of those who are incompetent**.\n\nI find it very strange that you think you know all 60 peers so well that you *know* they all are fully competent and deserve to pass. I think that is the least assumption. Rather than assuming 60+ people are all fully competent despite that being very abnormal or assuming that the teacher is simply amazing beyond normalcy- it's simply the assumption that among many many people (60) you don't know all of them, and the amount you know of each will diminish based on how much you know about them directly. More than likely, it's a simple explanation of \"You don't know them, so you don't identify their incompetence.\" Since a single person cannot know 60 people extremely well in a very brief time, and it is unlikely anyone except the teacher (and even then) knows all 60 well enough- it takes very little to assume this is the correct answer. (There is research to back up the amount of people one may know very well is limited, and applying this research and basic logic makes it pretty easy to conclude you don't know 60 people this well. Unless you personally grade all their work and talk to each of them for a significant amount of time about this very subject.)\n\nMore than likely you do not know those 60. In fact, you more than likely know very little about the majority of them. For all you know, some of them are cheaters, some of them only appear intelligent because they are quiet.\n\nAlso, how do you know they can all write lab papers? How do you know they can all read articles?\n\nAlso, how do you know they can comprehend what they read in those articles? Do they deserve to pass simply because they CAN read? Does it not matter their ability to understand what they read?\n\nThe **reason** they're passing, is because they **can** do the work. That is all that is required. School work does not identify competence. It identifies someone's ability to do the work.\n\nAlthough I'm skeptical that all you think are passing, are actually passing. I will set aside the fact people will not typically announce they are failing. So unless everyone's final grades are posted publicly, it sounds like a very arrogant think to assume you know all 0 people inside &amp; out. \n\nIntelligence is not required to graduate. Completing work is required to graduate. Grades are also not an identifier of competence. Someone could have straight D's and far surpass a straight A student.\n\nThis is the point of why everyone discusses this \"Everyone knows...\". Schools do NOT grade competence. Most of the time tests are testing your *memory*, not your competence. It's all a very poor system unless the intention is to churn out more students and make more money / appear like you're educating well.\n\nIn a class of 60 or 300+, you cannot know everyone well enough.

Remember you're a student, just like everyone else...which may be the problem!", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13", "qSentId": 1945, "question": "If you're sure it's not you, then continue on with Occam's razor. What is next?\n\nThe simple idea that although you CAN identify competence because you ARE competent, **you are not identifying the incompetence** or **you are unaware of those who are incompetent**.\n\nI find it very strange that you think you know all 60 peers so well that you *know* they all are fully competent and deserve to pass. I think that is the least assumption. Rather than assuming 60+ people are all fully competent despite that being very abnormal or assuming that the teacher is simply amazing beyond normalcy- it's simply the assumption that among many many people (60) you don't know all of them, and the amount you know of each will diminish based on how much you know about them directly. More than likely, it's a simple explanation of \"You don't know them, so you don't identify their incompetence.\" Since a single person cannot know 60 people extremely well in a very brief time, and it is unlikely anyone except the teacher (and even then) knows all 60 well enough- it takes very little to assume this is the correct answer. (There is research to back up the amount of people one may know very well is limited, and applying this research and basic logic makes it pretty easy to conclude you don't know 60 people this well. Unless you personally grade all their work and talk to each of them for a significant amount of time about this very subject.)\n\nMore than likely you do not know those 60. In fact, you more than likely know very little about the majority of them. For all you know, some of them are cheaters, some of them only appear intelligent because they are quiet.\n\nAlso, how do you know they can all write lab papers? How do you know they can all read articles?\n\nAlso, how do you know they can comprehend what they read in those articles? Do they deserve to pass simply because they CAN read? Does it not matter their ability to understand what they read?\n\nThe **reason** they're passing, is because they **can** do the work. That is all that is required. School work does not identify competence. It identifies someone's ability to do the work.\n\nAlthough I'm skeptical that all you think are passing, are actually passing. I will set aside the fact people will not typically announce they are failing. So unless everyone's final grades are posted publicly, it sounds like a very arrogant think to assume you know all 0 people inside &amp; out. \n\nIntelligence is not required to graduate. Completing work is required to graduate. Grades are also not an identifier of competence. Someone could have straight D's and far surpass a straight A student.\n\nThis is the point of why everyone discusses this \"Everyone knows...\". Schools do NOT grade competence. Most of the time tests are testing your *memory*, not your competence. It's all a very poor system unless the intention is to churn out more students and make more money / appear like you're educating well.\n\nIn a class of 60 or 300+, you cannot know everyone well enough. Even if you did, that doesn't mean you have the skills to identify incompetence. Hell, competence doesn't even guarantee you are competent enough to identify incompetence.\n\nEver hear of \"The Blind Leading the Blind\"?

You only have my word for it, but I am a competent physicist. A good physicist even. I know this comes off as arrogant, I am usually pretty modest but in this situation modesty isnt conducive to the discussion.  But lets ignore me for now.\n\nIts third year. About 70% of my class are leaving in June and will graduate with BSc. I know they can all write reports because we have to write reports and they are graded and the grades are posted to the board. Its not as simple as grading an exam, report grading is different. But its also unusual, so lets discard that too, for the sake of simplifying a physics course down to the same metric as other courses (purely based on exams in regards to who passes, which I agree has a disconnect to real world competence).\n\nLets start with what I know. There were people on our course unfit to use their physics knowledge in the real world. The didnt understand the material, or bummed off of other students, or didnt have a good work ethic. They are no longer with us. They either failed or quit.\n\nSo we are down to class work. With a max of 60 people in the class (the compulsory courses) and a usual number of 20 or so, the lecturers know us. The physics department of Exeter is small to begin with, and our year is smaller than most other years. Every one of our lecturers knows us by name and face, and has the time, and dedication, to constantly ask people to re-explain things, come down to the board to do the calculation, etc. We can all do that. We have understanding of our class work. We all DO do that. \n\nThe tutor system is also very good at exeter. 4 or 5 people to a tutor, meeting once a week, covering general questions we may have and also work sheets designed to test our understanding rather than remembrance of the material. While I am not in every tutor group, you pick things up. All the tutor groups are performing well.\n\nSo then we have the exams. Well, heres the thing. This is make or break. If the exams can be gamed, then you are correct. I may not be aware of how bad someone is. I know I understand the material, and I know that understanding is reflected in the exam scores, but if the guy next to me, who also gets good scores, got them just because he memorised the derivations, then the exam is flawed.\n\nWhich is why our exams dont ask us to write out the derivations. It asks us to explain how the derivation works, or gives us a 3D version of the 1D problem we learned, or uses a made up dispersion that requires different, untaught maths to calculate the density of states. We also have General Problems, something that is unique to Exeter and is basically a more taxing, written (as opposed to multiple choice) Physics GRE. They can ask us anything, the exam is rewritten every year and you cant just learn it. \n\nWith only 60 of us, we cant cheat. And frankly talking to people, none of us want to. I know that sounds crazy, I know the states has a lot of cheating in exams, but its just not a thing in my experience. Why cheat? With something like Phys, if you get your degree by cheating, you are screwed when working later. And again, memory isnt tested. We are given 90% of the equations. We have to transform them, apply them, pick the right ones to use in certain situations, there are often multiple ways to get the same answer etc. \n\nIm not saying everyone in my course is good. I will go on to toot my own horn briefly and say I have good understanding and test well and write reports well, and can do literature reviews well, etc. I want to go into Astro research, probably Cosmology though maybe Stellar Formation in Sub-mm wavelengths, and my tutors and lecturers thing I am more than capable of doing so (and seeing as they are Astro researchers themselves, I trust them). But some of my friends are not cut out for academia. But here is the thing, they still deserve their BScs. They would still be good as analysts or consultants. I can point to a few who would be great as finance modellers for inner city banks. \n\nBut thats a wide selection of jobs. So I come back to a metric I previously rejected. A metric that basically defines a modern scientists or any field. Can you do good lab work and get published. We all know the criteria to get published, and we all can read the lab work that is required to write those reports. We also know that sometimes people who shouldnt be scientists get published anyway, peer review isnt perfect. But its a good rule of thumb. So how can we, as a student body, test our ability to get published, peer reviewed, and not be found lacking? Well we already have. Second year extended lab project. 6 weeks of labs on a single, individually chosen experiment, working in pairs but with different goals, supervised by professors but not helped by them, with 80% of the marks resting on a lab report marked by 3, independent professors, 1 in the field of the experiment, 2 outside that field, 20% on the quality of the lab book you keep, with results published internally. We all did exceptionally well. All of us. For a start, no one failed, so we all wrote, as far as our professors were concerned, professional quality reports. 70% got 2:1 level or higher, and 40% got firsts meaning work of exceptional quality (first is roughly a GPE of 4.0 or higher I think?)\n\nMy point is there may be someone hiding in the pack, somehow striking lucky every time. But I dont know who they are. No one in my class group does. Therefore I dont know anyone who will graduate this year who doesnt deserve their BSc in Physics. They arnt obvious. We dont have a student who doesnt believe in Maxwell's equations (the equivalent of a Bio student not believing in viruses). We may have a student who doesnt quite grasp the Lorentz gauge for Maxwell's equations, but its such a small thing we dont know them as a bad physicist. \n\nI hope I am making sense, its a little hard to put across.

I'm not saying that people with PhDs are all imbeciles, but I also don't believe these people are more intelligent.\n\nWhat I am saying is that having aPhD doesn't automatically make you more intelligent and that it is an ever growing problem that people use their level of education as evidence that they are right instead of backing it up. \n\nThis is a complex issue and it's hard to articulate this from the device I'm on because it's not very efficient to type on. But the amount of conversations I've had with so called 'experts' with a PhD our masters degree in a given field that automatically think they are right about everything because the PhD makes them feel more intelligent than they actually are is becoming astounding. \n\nThen you get into the issue of compartmentalized and specialized areas of focus and their knowledge is much narrower than they perceive it to be in their heads. It's a psychological phenomenon that is common in elitist circles of all types, not just education.\n\nIt's an easy trap to fall into, especially with education. But students are often a reflection of their teachers and become hard set in thinking they can't be wrong if their teacher taught them something that says they are right... that's fine if they can back it up, but more and more often they don't, they use their degree... 'i studied this for years I have a PhD and masters in X field'... when debating something related but doesn't fall under their scope of focus so they don't know... But they weren't taught it, so they don't believe it's an issue and refuse to even debate it and just simply believe they can't be wrong unless the person they are talking to has an equal or greater education level than they do. Which falls into that elitist psychological trap which is a big problem we see the effects of playing out in politics and policy these days. \n\nI'm not trying to argue, my only real point is that a PhD is only a measure of intelligence to people who are not intelligent. Are they above the average curve, maybe, but I've seen more than a dozen cases of people I grew up with fall into that same mentality with no real achievements accept their education, which is a great achievement, but most of these people are not very bright, but they try really hard, and unfortunately are now overly confident with average intelligence and don't take anyone else without a PhD seriously in any kind of debate.\n\nI'm definitely over generalizing to make my point, but I digress. I'm not knocking it, I have a lot of respect for people who go through PhD programs, I just don't inherently think they are suddenly more intelligent than any other well read people I know that stopped after a bachelor's. Most of the smartest people I know only have a bachelor's and read and research as much or more than anyone. \n\nBut, I'm not trying to argue and I wish you well. I personally read text books for fun, in fact I commonly ask people for their course outlines and text book names for all their classes, and I've had 2 people that were actually welling to share with me what they were, because if that very thing I'm pointing out here.

There\u2019s THAT ONE where they actually used a saline placebo in 115 children and found that those vaccinated had a 4.4 times increased rate of non-flu infection?

What is near and familiar is what is true. Few of us seek to bridge gaps between what we are surrounded by and what may be out there to learn. The difficulty of appreciating the scale of harm brought to the population by vaccination practice is related to the insidious nature of immune and neurologic insult.\nThe CDC can report, as they do, that brain inflammation and death are known side effects of every vaccine, but most do not appreciate what brain inflammation looks like. That this can look like ADHD, autism, learning delay, and that autoimmune disorders can take years to manifest. Tracing the thread back to the vaccine exposure can only be done with studies that assess vaccinated versus unvaccinated populations. These have not been done.\n\nTragically, we all know, now, of someone who has died from the flu vaccine, just this past week. CHANDLER WEBB, a healthy 19 year old, was given a \u201croutine\u201d and \u201crecommended\u201d flu vaccine at his physical, one day before he became violently ill, and one month before he died. He died from vaccine-induced encephalitis, a known risk of this intervention. In addition to feeling remorse for the pain that this family is experiencing, I feel rage for what I believe to be manslaughter. This is a medical intervention, delivered without any regard for its objectively determined lack of efficacy, and its potential to maim and kill healthy adults.\n\nThe propaganda surrounding this CDC and government-endorsed practice is so thick that doctors treating this young man were blind to even the most obvious of causative insults. If doctors cannot appreciate a documented adverse event that occurs within 24 hours, you cannot expect the system to acknowledge more complex disturbances to the immune system and neuorologic development that will land you and your loved ones on medications and in therapies for life.\nAnd, remember, that this family cannot sue the physician who pushed the needle or the pharmaceutical company who created the lethal product.\nI think about the Cliff\u2019s Notes version, a distillation of why the flu vaccine is evidence that our government and regulatory bodies have forgotten us, and are following an objective that may leave you lying dead on the side of the road. I know that few of you will read the papers that I have read, attend lectures, seminars, and dialogue with concerned experts. If nothing else, digest these important points, and then wait until this issue gets close enough to you to change your mind on it\u2026hopefully before it\u2019s too late.\n\n\u2022It\u2019s not indicated: I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t know a single person who has died of the flu, and if you think you do, I can almost guarantee you that the diagnosis was not confirmed in a way that ruled out the 150-200 infectious pathogens that cause flu-like syndromes, none of which would be \u201ccovered\u201d by the vaccine. Despite the astronomical figures the CDC flashes before us of \u201cflu deaths\u201d, there were 18 (yes, 1-8) confirmed in 2001, for example. Access to these figures is suspiciously concealed, but in the end, forget the stats, and use some common sense to see the fear mongering and sales marketing for what it is.\n\n\u2022It doesn\u2019t work: The Cochrane Database \u2013 an objective, gold-standard assessment of available evidence has plainly stated, in TWO STUDIES, that there is no data to support efficacy in children under two, and in adults. Even the former Chief Vaccine Officer at the FDA states: \u201cthere is no evidence that any influenza vaccine thus far developed is effective in preventing or mitigating any attack of influenza.\u201d Liking the idea of being protected from the flu does not equate to being protected from the flu. That\u2019s essentially what your vaccine-promoting doctor (or pharmacist) is engaging in \u2013 promoting an idea.\n\n\u2022Should there ever be a medical intervention appropriate for everyone?\nIt\u2019s being pushed on demographics where it is known to be ineffective, or is unstudied and likely unsafe including children, adults, elderly, and pregnant women as reviewed on THIS WEB SITE and GREENMEDINFO. I write about how this offends my sensibilities as a perinatal physician HERE.\n\n\u2022We just don\u2019t know what we are doing: The grave possibility of undetectable viral proteins in the chick embryos used to culture vaccines is just an example of how the immune roulette of vaccine development and rampant implementation has resulted in death and lasting injury. C. jejeuni contamination, for example, IS THEORIZED TO PLAY A ROLE in documented risk of Guillain-Barre paralysis after flu vaccine. Producing antibody response to virus and associated toxic preservatives is not immunity. We know that now.\n\nAs those of us who shake our heads in pain and frustration watching the sheep get herded off the cliff, we refrain: these agents cannot be considered \u201csafe and effective\u201d and also \u201cunavoidably unsafe\u201d as the government agencies would have us accept.

Why do people act like this online. Is this how you would treat somebody in person? If it is , you would not get away with it with me.\n\nNow on to your point, you admit people have adverse reactions.  Great.  That is a start.\n\nNow let's continue to be reasonable. When there is a connection, like the one in the article I referenced, it needs to be further studied. Right now there are no studies, once a vaccine is approved (and often well before) the point is to \"prove\" that there are NEVER adverse reactions.\n\nAsshole comments aside you seem pretty intelligent.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13", "qSentId": 3895, "question": "A Shot Never Worth Taking: The Flu Vaccine ~ by Kelly Brogan, MD\n\nDeep into my 6th year of researching and investigating the damning science that condemns vaccine efficacy and safety \u2013 yes, all of them \u2013 I am beginning to turn my attention more to the societal memes and the individual belief systems that protect and perpetuate tragically flawed and unacceptably dangerous collective behaviors.\n\nThe information is OUT THERE, brilliant scientists, physicians, and researchers without financial ties and agendas have weighed in and presented their concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy, however, the average citizen resists and clings to a hyper-simplified, seemingly \u201csafe\u201d stance.\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m not against vaccines, I mean, they\u2019ve done a lot. I\u2019m sure there are some risks, but they\u2019re extremely rare.\u201d\n\nI understand, now, that, my collection of PubMed articles substantiating concerns about inefficacy, neurological, autoimmune, and fatal risks of these poorly conceived and anachronistically relevant immune modulators is not meaningful to someone who is not interested. The questions raised by this information are not provocative to someone who needs, above all, to believe that the government, the CDC, and doctors mean well, are doing their due diligence, and that they are holding themselves to a basic standard of ethical delivery of healthcare. They are not meaningful to someone who needs to outsource their power.\n\nInstead of debating the science, what it may take to change to bring awareness to this egregious misuse of medical authority is, one of two, non-scientific, anecdotal exposures:\n\n1.They see it doesn\u2019t work, and may even cause illness\nI have several pediatricians as patients. Unprovoked, all of these women have confessed to me that they have observed increased virulence in their vaccinated populations. It is this clinical experience that has given them pause about the heavy-handed mandate coming down from the CDC.\n\u201cOh!\u201d I say, \u201cHave you read the studies that suggest increased risk of infection in the vaccinated population? There\u2019s THAT ONE where they actually used a saline placebo in 115 children and found that those vaccinated had a 4.4 times increased rate of non-flu infection? Or how about that CANADIAN ONE where they looked at 4 observational studies and found that 2008-2009 H1N1 vaccination was associated with a1.4 to 2.5 increased risk of actually contracting said virus?\u201d\nOnly after they have a personal template within which to fit the science affirming their observations, do they have room to hear it. But what of all of the children they have brought this ineffective and dangerous intervention to?\n\n2.They know someone harmed\nIt is basic human psychology that what is out over there is irrelevant at best, and threatening at worst. What is near and familiar is what is true. Few of us seek to bridge gaps between what we are surrounded by and what may be out there to learn. The difficulty of appreciating the scale of harm brought to the population by vaccination practice is related to the insidious nature of immune and neurologic insult.\nThe CDC can report, as they do, that brain inflammation and death are known side effects of every vaccine, but most do not appreciate what brain inflammation looks like. That this can look like ADHD, autism, learning delay, and that autoimmune disorders can take years to manifest. Tracing the thread back to the vaccine exposure can only be done with studies that assess vaccinated versus unvaccinated populations. These have not been done.\n\nTragically, we all know, now, of someone who has died from the flu vaccine, just this past week. CHANDLER WEBB, a healthy 19 year old, was given a \u201croutine\u201d and \u201crecommended\u201d flu vaccine at his physical, one day before he became violently ill, and one month before he died. He died from vaccine-induced encephalitis, a known risk of this intervention. In addition to feeling remorse for the pain that this family is experiencing, I feel rage for what I believe to be manslaughter. This is a medical intervention, delivered without any regard for its objectively determined lack of efficacy, and its potential to maim and kill healthy adults.\n\nThe propaganda surrounding this CDC and government-endorsed practice is so thick that doctors treating this young man were blind to even the most obvious of causative insults. If doctors cannot appreciate a documented adverse event that occurs within 24 hours, you cannot expect the system to acknowledge more complex disturbances to the immune system and neuorologic development that will land you and your loved ones on medications and in therapies for life.\nAnd, remember, that this family cannot sue the physician who pushed the needle or the pharmaceutical company who created the lethal product.\nI think about the Cliff\u2019s Notes version, a distillation of why the flu vaccine is evidence that our government and regulatory bodies have forgotten us, and are following an objective that may leave you lying dead on the side of the road.

The incidence of autoimmune and neurological disorders in the U.S., many of them seriously debilitating, some of them ultimately fatal, dwarfs the incidence of mortality or injury from infectious disease. The aluminum salt adjuvants in vaccines, by the current vaccination schedule administered sixteen times to a child before the age of two (7), have been tied in various studies to both autoimmune and neurological disorders (8)(9). Toxicologist Dr. Victor Vaughn testified to the FTC that aluminum salts are poisonous when injected (10). Adjuvants are used by researchers to study autoimmunity, because when injected into lab animals they trigger rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases (11).\n\nMercury is still present and accounted for in multi-dose vials of flu vaccine (4), in full, preservative concentration, and most of the shots administered are from those vials \u2013 they\u2019re cheaper per shot, thus more likely to be stocked by doctors, and the majority of vaccine recipients simply aren\u2019t aware of the tremendous difference in mercury concentration, single dose versus multi. In TV coverage of a flu shot clinic held at an elementary school last winter, every kid was given a shot from a multi-dose vial. No doubt, the parents were denied any notification or meaningful warning of the mercury content. Mercury is present in trace amounts in several other vaccines, but while the CDC characterizes a trace as a\u2026biologically unpersuasive\u2026amount, there truly are no known lower safety limits for injected toxins.

Moreover, at one point some years ago, a public health advocate website sent four vaccine samples to a lab for analysis; two of the samples were labeled as containing a trace of thimerosal, two as containing none, but mercury was detected in all four samples (12).

Five years later it\u2019ll be 1 in 5 boys, and about 1 in 25 girls. The CDC is well aware of the apparently uncontrollable tide, yet each time the number is updated feigns surprise, or apparent lack of concern, or we see yet another spate of research, such as a recent study linking autism to environmental factors in the womb \u2013 but always with careful, deliberate avoidance of any mention of vaccines as even a possible causal factor.\n\nWhen you consider the possible outcome only two generations down the line, the effect in every way imaginable of the inexorable degradation of the nation\u2019s physical health and mental acuity is beyond description.

How many children have died in the last year because they were not vaccinated? \n\nListen, I'm all for the exchange of ideas, and you have attempted to bring light to some, but first things first, drop the bible thumper bs way of talking: \"That delay is the Great Divide, the temporal chasm separating the harsh reality of vaccination \" - save that ish for people who are lost and fascinated by your linguistic aptitude, I don't wan't to have to read 10 paragraphs to see you are making 1 point, in whic you make a fake reference (10) but there is not actual study/bibliography.\n\nYour first claim: \"Meanwhile, immunologists tell us that it can take months, and even years, for adjuvant-induced autoimmune diseases to display (5); lupus, epilepsy, diabetes, asthma, blood disorders, arthritis, Guillain-Barr\u00e9, encephalitis; autistic encephalitis (6).\"\n\nAnswer - No, vaccines have not been attributed to any of these disease. In fact peer review (peer review means that other doctors, scientists etc have read it and decided the information was of high quality - as in there was little to no bias, the results are 'natural and true.'). If you have EVIDENCE please respond and reference\n\nclaim #2: Aluminum Cl is bad - sure that is true at high concentraions. I went to some of the anti vax sites and they just give false info. One site claims there was 125 mcg Al in each vaccine, when the truth is there is 0.125 mcg Al!!! \n\n\"The aluminum contained in vaccines is similar to that found in a liter (about 1 quart or 32 fluid ounces) of infant formula. While infants receive about 4.4 milligrams* of aluminum in the first six months of life from vaccines, they receive more than that in their diet. Breast-fed infants ingest about 7 milligrams, formula-fed infants ingest about 38 milligrams, and infants who are fed soy formula ingest almost 117 milligrams of aluminum during the same period.\"\n\nAgain with the Rheumatoid Arthritis, it is not even linked to vaccines: \"Because the immunisation programmes and epidemiological studies indicate that there is no or only a very slight association between hepatitis B vaccination and autoimmune or chronic inflammatory rheumatic disorders, the benefits of the vaccine probably outweigh the risks of possible side effects. Universal hepatitis B vaccination indeed significantly reduced the virus carrier and infection rates among children and adolescents in a hyperendemic area.\" - Also repeated in numerous studies that are legitimate - just google / pubmed.\n\nclaim 3: mercury - yes vaccines contain mercury, however the exposure from vaccination still exposes children to levels that are below hte reccomended limit of exposure. Mercury is everywhere, you are exposed all the time. Do you eat fish? Breath air? Just like you are exposed to radiation and you can't do anything about it, but htere is a safe level of exposure, and vaccination falls into it. Again, some anti vax websites have the levels contained within vaccines blatantly wrong - do they even know what a microgram is?\n\n\nThere is no statements, just very loose correlation in the entire paragraph - first of all introduction of vaccination wasn't the only thing that happend in this timeline - how can you attribute these cherry picked changes to that??? Guess what - average age of life has skyrocketed recently too, is that because of vaccines? [actually in my sarcasm this does have an affect on the ave age] : \"In the U.S., mortality from infectious disease was down in the single digits per 100,000 in the general population well before the vaccines were introduced (14).

OK. So then if the vaccines take care of the 95 or whatever percentile but reduce the competition is that different from what were doing with antibiotics making way for superbugs? ", "aSentId": 4977, "answer": "Basically it comes down to the fact that, in order for a pathogen to infect a population it must maintain itself in a population, ie it must have enough strength to maintain itself. Many vaccines do a great job of preventing illness when nearly all of the population are using them which is why we've seen diseases like pertussis and measles disappear from the U.S. following widespread vaccination in the mid to late 20th century. Unfortunately we now see what happens when people begin to turn their backs on vaccinating allowing these diseases an opportunity to gain a foothold back in areas in which they were eliminated.\n\nIn terms of the creation of superbugs, these are different issues as antibiotics work in ways that are much different than vaccines. Essentially, vaccines introduce your immune system to markers that are unique to the pathogen that they are supposed to cover against. This allows your immune system to \"learn\" and \"remember\" what the pathogen looks like so it has the ability to attack it in the future. Most bacteria and viruses that we vaccinate against do not have the ability to change the markers that vaccines use to train our bodies immune systems with this they are good for long periods of times. A few viruses, notably the flu virus, is able to change it's identifying markers quite easily which is why we vaccinate every year for it. When it comes to antibiotics, we are using a chemical to bypass our immune system and directly kill bacteria. Since bacteria replicate so quickly, if there are a few bacteria that are able to survive an attack from an antibiotic, they can then reproduce and create more bacteria which will not die when exposed to an antibiotic (termed resistance). If antibiotics are not used properly and a bacteria develops resistance to many antibiotics then we term it a superbug. Antibiotic resistance is a huge and worsening problem which has a lot to do with misuse of antibiotics, but luckily we don't have to worry too much about resistance with most pathogens we vaccinate for as we're allowing our immune system to fight off future exposures rather than a specific chemical.\n\nSorry, that was a bit much and maybe had some rambling but basically we don't really have to worry about creating superbugs from vaccines like we do with antibiotics because they work through different mechanisms.

It's why in Russian there is an old saying regarding Pravda (Truth): \u0412 \u0418\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043d\u044b \u043d\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0439, \u0438 \u0432 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044f\u0445 \u043d\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0438 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u044b. *In the Truth there is no news, and in the News there is no truth.*  Putin's crackdown on Russian news sources over the last few years has had a similar feel, and has observably degraded the standards of journalism in the country.  People are right to question just how the news is reported in Russia.\n\nInb4 \"But whatabout ABCNNBCBSBBCBCMSNFOX\"", "aSentId": 6301, "answer": "The point is: Pretending that US media is any less biased propaganda and that it is not just composed of corporations doing what they are told by the oligarchs that rule the country is ridiculous.\n\nPeople on reddit love to pretend that Russian media somehow is evil and worse than that of the US and you see Americans ridiculing it.

Too many able bodied males from one bride get killed, males from another come across them, kill all the cubs and attempt to restart with the Lionesses.\n\nProblem is this rarely results in more new lion cubs than what would have survived if lions didn't have this instinctual tendency. It's a survival instinct for genetic selection that has yet to adapt and probably never will to human poaching. \n\nBut selective legal Lion Hunting actually helps increase lion population. Eventually an Alpha lion retains monopoly on the females but is not begetting cubs nearly as much. If there are a sufficient number of other adult males, and the elder is killed, it booms the reproduction rate in a pride. \n\nAnti regulated-hunting advocacy is well intended but is actually detrimental to Lions. You want to encourage and cheer someone who forks over 500,000 to lion conservation efforts to get the chance to kill a Lion and retain the trophy.

The issue, underscored by a speech to Congress by Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu \u2013 at Republicans\u2019 invitation \u2013 that railed against the deal, allowed Republicans to briefly unite on a policy point. The party has otherwise been riven by conservative and libertarian factions who disagree about issues such immigration, the economy and foreign intervention.\n\nBut the condescending tone of the letter, which suggested that Iranians do not understand the American political process, provoked harsh words from Iran.\n\nIran\u2019s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Thursday during a meeting with members of Iran\u2019s top clerical body, which includes President Hassan Rouhani.\u00a0\u201cThe letter by American senators indicates the collapse of political ethics in the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cGovernments are bound to their commitments by international laws and would not violate their obligations with a change of government,\u201d he said. \u201cThey [the Republican senators] said they want to teach us their own laws but we don\u2019t need their lessons, our officials know how to make agreements binding if there\u2019s a deal.\u201d\n\nIran\u2019s foreign minister, Javad Zarif called earlier the letter a \u201cpropaganda ploy\u201d and derided Republicans for failing to understand international and US law.\u00a0Harvard law professor Jack Goldsmith notes that Zarif has a valid point: the letter incorrectly states that the Senate has the power to ratify treaties, which it does not \u2013 a fact stated even on the Senate\u2019s own website.\n\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest said the Republicans\u2019 open letter\u2019s \u201cmost profound impact\u201d was to erode the trust of international partners and allies in the United States.\n\nEarnest said \u201cgenerations of credibility\u201d were threatened by the actions of the Republicans, and that \u201cthat confidence in the United States of America has been undermined\u201d as allies and other nations weighed whether the US would keep its promises.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a laughing matter,\u201d Earnest said.\n\nRepublicans briefly enjoyed a moment of unity by sending the letter, but their coalition cracked as several conservative congressmen and media outlets described the letter as a folly.\n\nCorker, one of the few Republicans who did not sign the letter, told the Daily Beast that he \u201cimmediately knew that it was not something that, for me, anyway, in my particular role, was going to be constructive\u201d.\n\nRepublican senator Jeff Flake said the letter was \u201cnot appropriate or productive\u201d, and that the matter of Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities was \u201ctoo important to divide us among partisan lines\u201d.\n\nHawkish congressman Peter King also called the wisdom of the letter into question. King told reporters on Tuesday he thought the letter set a poor precedent: \u201cI don\u2019t trust the president on this, quite frankly, though I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d go public with it to a foreign government.\u201d\n\nFlake\u2019s comments echoed those of Democrats who continued to excoriate Republicans over the letter. Senator Debbie Stabenow took to the chamber floor to quote former senator Arthur Vandenberg, a Republican during the second world war who she said \u201cloathed\u201d president Franklin D Roosevelt.\n\n\u201c\u2018Politics stops at the water\u2019s edge,\u2019\u201d Stabenow quoted Vandenberg. \u201cI can only imagine what senator Vandenberg would say if he were alive today,\u201d she said, about Republicans who had \u201cdecided to throw away 70 years of wisdom and stand on the side of the ayatollahs\u201d.\n\nFlorida Democrat Bill Nelson also urged Republicans to keep perspective: \u201cWe can disagree about the specifics but we still have to honor the institution of the presidency, and when it becomes matters of war and peace then we\u2019ve got to unify.\u201d\n\nObama said that the letter put Republican senators in an \u201cunusual coalition\u201d, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s somewhat ironic to see some members of Congress wanting to make common cause with the hardliners in Iran.\u201d Vice-president Joe Biden said the the letter was \u201cbeneath the dignity of the institution I revere\u201d.\n\nConservative media sources such as the Wall Street Journal and Fox News, both owned by Rupert Murdoch, also shied away from the letter. The Journal\u2019s editors published an editorial calling the letter a \u201cdistraction\u201d. Fox host Megyn Kelly asked Senator Tom Cotton, the letter\u2019s author: \u201cWhat\u2019s the point in writing to the Iranian mullahs?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey dismissed it already,\u201d she pressed. \u201cyYou\u2019ve offended the Obama administration and you may have offended some of the Democrats who would have come over with the Republicans depending on what happens with this deal, to have a stronger say in the Senate.\u201d\n\nIn Iran, even ayatollah Mahmoud Shahroudi suggested that negotiations deserve a chance to succeed, according to state-owned the Islamic Republic News Agency. Iranian officials \u201care seeking to advance national interests and we support them\u201d, Shahroudi said in a statement.\n\nShahroudi\u2019s support reiterates Zarif\u2019s position, which finds Republican intransigence \u201cunfortunate\u201d but is still \u201ccertain that there are measures to achieve such a deal\u201d.\n\n", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13", "qSentId": 11210, "question": "21% percent of eligible voters aged 18-29 bothered to cast a ballot in 2014.\n\n21 fucking percent.

In 1983, Teddy Kennedy sent emissaries to the Soviets to undermine Ronald Reagan\u2019s foreign policy. According to a memo finally released in 1991 from head of the KGB Victor Chebrikov to then-Soviet leader Yuri Andropov:\n\nOn 9-10 May of this year, Sen. Edward Kennedy\u2019s close friend and trusted confidant [John] Tunney was in Moscow. The senator charged Tunney to convey the following message, through confidential contacts, to the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Y. Andropov.\n\nWhat was the message? That Teddy would help stifle Reagan\u2019s anti-Soviet foreign policy if the Soviets would help Teddy run against Reagan in 1984. Kennedy offered to visit Moscow to \u201carm Soviet officials with explanations regarding problems of nuclear disarmament so they may be better prepared and more convincing during appearances in the USA.\u201d Then he said that he would set up interviews with Andropov in the United States. \u201cKennedy and his friends will bring about suitable steps to have representatives of the largest television companies in the USA contact Y.V.

The memo concluded:\n\nTunney remarked that the senator wants to run for president in 1988. Kennedy does not discount that during the 1984 campaign, the Democratic Party may officially turn to him to lead the fight against the Republicans and elect their candidate president.\n\n*House Speaker Jim Wright (D-TX).* In 1984, 10 Democrats sent a letter to Daniel Ortega Saavedra, the head of the military dictatorship in Nicaragua, praising Saavedra for \u201ctaking steps to open up the political process in your country.\u201d House Speaker Jim Wright signed the letter.\n\nIn 1987, Wright worked out a deal to bring Ortega to the United States to visit with lawmakers. As The New York Timesreported:\n\nThere were times when the White House seemed left out of the peace process, uninformed, irritated. \u201dWe don\u2019t have any idea what\u2019s going on,\u201d an Administration official said Thursday. And there was a bizarre atmosphere to the motion and commotion: the leftist Mr. Ortega, one of President Reagan\u2019s arch enemies, heads a Government that the Administration has been trying to overthrow by helping to finance a war that has killed thousands of Nicaraguans on both sides. Yet he was freely moving around Washington, visiting Mr. Wright in his Capitol Hill office, arguing his case in Congress and at heavily covered televised news conferences. He criticized President Reagan; he recalled that the United States, whose troops intervened in Nicaragua several times between 1909 and 1933, had supported the Somoza family dictatorship which lasted for 43 years until the Sandinistas overthrew it in 1979.\n\nOrtega then sat next to Wright as he presented a \u201cdetailed cease-fire proposal.\u201d The New York Times said, \u201cMr. Ortega seemed delighted to turn to Mr. Wright.\u201d\n\n*Senator John Kerry(D-MA).* Kerry jumped into the pro-Sandanista pool himself in 1985, when he traveled to Nicaragua to negotiate with the regime.

We negotiated with North Vietnam. Why can we not negotiate with a country smaller than North Carolina and with half the population of Massachusetts? It\u2019s beyond me.

This is the real world and every action in the global theater will have inevitable fallout.  What is the alternative?  To sit back and do nothing while the greater threats escalate?  Iran going nuclear is far more detrimental to the world than the unrest that would arise from forcibly stopping them!  These Arabs hate the USA and Europe, and ANYONE not living under Sharia Law.  They will not be appeased by anything short of it and even If we kissed their asses and granted them the sun the sky and the stars, they would STILL pine for our annihilation because we are \"infidels\".  \n\n\"Furthermore, you ARE aware that the ENTIRE reason that Iran is a such an extreme, anti-American theocracy IS because of the US, right?

APPEASEMENT WILL NOT WORK with their ideology!  It will only be taken advantage of until they become a far greater threat than they are now.  It is strategic brinksmanship.\n\nIran has ZERO, and I repeat, ZERO necessity for ANY enrichment of uranium for ANY purpose.  Period. Full-stop.  This asinine Agreement that Obama has entered into allows for nuclear enrichment, which by any measure, is a significant step towards the ability to create a nuclear weapon, or at minimum, a dirty bomb created with the radioactive byproducts of their \"peaceful nuclear energy program\". Iran has already had secretive underground and hidden enrichment facilities and a history of arming and training terrorists.  Something \"innocent\" purveyors of peace should surely never behave like.\n\n\"However, you have to understand diplomacy. The last ~70 years of history have shown that aggressive diplomacy rarely, if ever works.\"\n\n--Notwithstanding your wording, which implies only violence works  (\"Aggressive diplomacy\" is diplomacy, not war), you are utterly and historically wrong.  Aggressive sanctions do work, and full-scale war does, in fact, stop an immediate threat if diplomacy fails.\n\n \"It has also shown that toppling any government that disagrees with you tends to backfire spectacularly (case in point: Iran).\"\n\n--Wrong.  It is messy and highly complicated and yes there is a chain of events that will inevitably follow.  The alternative to this is to sit passively back as problems escalate until there is a much greater threat to the civilised world that is far worse than the aforementioned resultant chain of events.\n\n\"You won't ever get anywhere (diplomatically) by hard-lining a country. At best you'll just make them hate you more, at worst you'll replace their entire government with one that wants to destroy you.\"\n\n--So appeasement is your strategy?  Perhaps we should let Russia just conquer the Ukraine.  Then the Russians will finally love the Americans..... Or will it further embolden them as their rhetoric will have proven itself to be effective? Appeasement does not beget peace in the global theater.  History makes this bloody obvious if you have even a fucking inkling of knowledge.\n\n\"You have to encourage them to reform on their own, and integrate them into the world economy which has been historically shown to be the path to peace and human rights development.\"\n\n--Yes, when you have a nation and government of rational, peace-minded people and not a Jihadist-mined religious fundamentalist state with a proven track record of sponsoring international terrorism and a desire to wipe an entire nation of Israel off the map because of their differing religious beliefs.  Afghanistan seems pretty fucking resistant to nation-building if you want just one glaring example.\n\n\"Never mind that what you are talking about contradicts the actual facts of the matter (under the plan Iran wouldn't be able to build up any kind of nuclear arsenal without decades of work).\"\n\n--Ten years ago, the goddamned politicians were saying Iran could have the bomb in 10 years.   Lets just keep moving the goal posts back to suit this pathetic Obama administration's ass-backwards notion of foreign policy. Whether it is tomorrow or ten years from now, they cannot have even a single goddamned foothold towards weaponized nuclear capabilities.  Not one. They are not a free and egalitarian State with the best wishes of humanity in mind.  They are theocratic ideologues with Jihadist desires.  They currently supply arms and training to terrorists and currently fight proxy wars for the benefit of Jihad. They operatate via extreme religious fundamentalism and in no way can be entrusted with nuclear ambitions whatsoever.\n\n\"North Korea has proven that even the most inept, backwards countries can develop nuclear weapons given enough time, so its really a non-issue.\"\n\n-- A NON-ISSUE?? Are you out of your fucking mind?  Apart from the multitude of layers of absurdity in that statement, Korea is in an isolated corner of the planet and is still very much a threat, whereas Iran is squarely in the center of the Middle-East surrounded by like-minded, Jihadist fundamentalists who aren't well known to accept a world that is not under Sharia Law. The strategic geoplolitics of their position makes them far more a threat than North Korea is, to the surrounding nations of the Mid-East, Israel, and to the world at large.\n\n\" And never mind that alternative you are suggesting has been proven not to work (in fact, it only encourages them to hate us even more)\"\n\n--What is the alternative you assume I am suggesting? My alternative is to not allow them ANY nuclear enrichment, via sanctions, political strong-arming, and non-violent means.  If actual war becomes a necessity, it will ONLY be because of Iran's INSISTENCE to go nuclear.  \n\nAt what point do people and nations take responsibility for their own actions and stop blaming externalities for all of their problems?  IF IRAN HALTED THEIR NUCLEAR PURSUITS TODAY, THE ENTIRE PROBLEM WE ARE FACING WITH THEM WOULD CEASE TO EXIST!  \n\nWhy does Iran insist on going nuclear? IRAN IS INSISTING ON GOING NUCLEAR because it is about WEAPONS pure and simple.

Andropov.\n\nWhat was the message? That Teddy would help stifle Reagan\u2019s anti-Soviet foreign policy if the Soviets would help Teddy run against Reagan in 1984. Kennedy offered to visit Moscow to \u201carm Soviet officials with explanations regarding problems of nuclear disarmament so they may be better prepared and more convincing during appearances in the USA.\u201d Then he said that he would set up interviews with Andropov in the United States. \u201cKennedy and his friends will bring about suitable steps to have representatives of the largest television companies in the USA contact Y.V.

Yet he was freely moving around Washington, visiting Mr. Wright in his Capitol Hill office, arguing his case in Congress and at heavily covered televised news conferences. He criticized President Reagan; he recalled that the United States, whose troops intervened in Nicaragua several times between 1909 and 1933, had supported the Somoza family dictatorship which lasted for 43 years until the Sandinistas overthrew it in 1979.\n\nOrtega then sat next to Wright as he presented a \u201cdetailed cease-fire proposal.\u201d The New York Times said, \u201cMr. Ortega seemed delighted to turn to Mr. Wright.\u201d\n\nSenator John Kerry (D-MA).

We negotiated with North Vietnam. Why can we not negotiate with a country smaller than North Carolina and with half the population of Massachusetts? It\u2019s beyond me.

Bush, stating, \u201cthe president of the United States will lie to the American people in order to get us into this war.\u201d McDermott, along with his colleagues, suggested that the American administration give the Iraqi regime \u201cdue process\u201d and \u201ctake the Iraqis on their face value.\u201d Bonior said openly he was acting on behalf of the government:\n\nThe purpose of our trip was to make it very clear, as I said in my opening statement, to the officials in Iraq how serious we\u2013the United States is about going to war and that they will have war unless these inspections are allowed to go unconditionally and unfettered and open.

So that, you, the customer, are somewhat stuck...  The cost of exiting your contract is quite high: leaving the territory, selling your house, moving to another country, etc. these are not easy things to do.  But they are much easier for Spaniards than for, say, Greek people, because so many other countries speak spanish, so Spain's citizen-customers are certainly not hostages.\n\nThis approach is generally called \"voting with your feet\".  If voting at the ballot no longer works, voting with your feet definitely does.  You are actually doing the people who stay behind a favour: the more customers the state loses, the quicker it'll go bankrupt and change will be forced to happen, exactly in the same way as happens for a private company.\n\nAnother avenue to explore, in the case of Spain specifically, relies on the fact that Spain is made up of several territories which already like to see themselves as separate entities.  Catalunya is flirting with independence, the Basque country too, even Valencia, the Balearic Islands, Galicia, etc.  \n\nSo, if change cannot happen at a state level, it is certainly feasible that it could happen at a smaller level, which is what we saw in China with the creation of what were effectively city states (the Special Economic Zones).  In this scenario, the large and sclerotic state cannot reform, but the city states reform instead.  Another successful example of this route is Estonia, which took advantage of the Soviet economic collapse to declare independence and push through a very dynamic, small but free state.  Taxes were low enough to incentivise the creation of new businesses, the new state's bureaucracy was reduced to a minimum, and what little there was used the latest internet technology to create the world's first e-government.\n\nBack to a more personal level, take advantage of just how networked the world has become.  People often complain about rich people who manage to live in one country, set up a business in another and work in a third.  But these things have now become possible for everyone.  You no longer have to physically be in a country like, say, the UK to register a company there: company registrations are done online.  You can set up a website in no time, you can take payment online in no time, you can bank online, you can advertise on YouTube and Facebook and Twitter online.  For all these things, you are free, and completely autonomous from whatever local authority tells you to do.\n\nI'm kind of rambling here, but my goal with this post is just to make the point that a completely different mindset is the place to start.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13", "qSentId": 13397, "question": "\"Left wing\" and \"right wing\" are both concepts that rely on progress emanating from the state, rather than from society itself.

", "aSentId": 13404, "answer": "You've managed to make my case for me, actually, with your example of China.  \n\nChina's economic growth started precisely when Deng Xiaoping came to power, realised that state control over China was economically unsustainable, and changed the nation's course from a statist system to a free trade system during the 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee in 1978.  \n\nDeng Xiaoping made the case that Hong Kong had managed to create so much more wealth than similar sized cities in China, and put forward a plan to let go of current state policy in individual cities, called *Special Economic Zones*.  Companies in these zones would not be state-owned and private business could flourish.  All State Owned Companies in these zones would be privatised, and opened up to capital from abroad.  Laws in these zones were set autonomously by the cities, rather than central government.\n\nThe first cities to change were Shenzhen, Zhuhai and Shantou in Guangdong Province and Xiamen in Fujian Province.\n\nOver time, as and when the project became more successful, more cities were added to the list: Dalian, Qinhuangdao, Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, Lianyungang, Nantong, Shanghai, Ningbo, Wenzhou, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, Zhanjiang and Beihai.\n\nToday, entire provinces like Hainan are labelled SEZ.  This is where every item in your household that is \"Made in China\" is produced, by private companies.\n\nChina's phenomenal growth over the last couple of decades isn't the result of statist policy, it's what happens when you let go of statist policy.", "corpus": "reddit"},{"docID": "t5_2qh13", "qSentId": 13395, "question": "That's what you get for voting right wingers in.
